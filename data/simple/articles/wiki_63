Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany

Cosimo III de' Medici (14 August 1642 – 31 October 1723) was the penultimate Grand Duke of Tuscany. He reigned from 1670 to 1723, and was the elder son of Grand Duke Ferdinando II of Tuscany. Cosimo's fifty long reign, the longest in Tuscan history, was marked by a series of regulatory laws. His reign also saw Tuscany's bad finances become even worse. He was succeeded by his elder surviving son, Gian Gastone de' Medici, when he died, in 1723. 

He married Marguerite Louise d'Orléans, a cousin of Louis XIV. It was a bad marriage and Marguerite Louise eventually left Tuscany to remain at the Convent of Montmartre in Paris. Together, they had 3 children. In later life, he tried to have Anna Maria Luisa recognised as heiress of Tuscany, but Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, would not allow it. Tuscany passed passed to the House of Lorraine in 1737.

Cosimo III had three children with Marguerite Louise d'Orléans, a granddaughter of Henry IV of France:

Gian Gastone de' Medici (24 May 1671 – 9 July 1737) was the last Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany. He was the second son of Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Marguerite Louise d'Orléans. His sister, Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, the Electress Palatine, married him to Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg in 1697. The two remained childless and it was common knowledge that Gian Gastone was homosexual. Gian Gastone succeeded his father as Grand Duke in 1723.

In his reign he reversed all his father's laws and stopped taxes for poorer people, repealed (got rid of) the anti-Jewish laws and stopped public executions. His father, Cosimo III, wanted the his sister to succeed him but Spain, Great Britain, Austria and the Dutch Republic disregarded and made Charles III of Spain his heir. Charles changed his claim to Francis III of Lorraine. Francis then became the Grand Duke on 9 July 1737 ending almost 300 years of Medici rule over Florence.

Marguerite Louise d'Orléans

Marguerite Louise d'Orléans (28 July 1645 – 17 September 1721) was Grand Duchess of Tuscany, as the wife of Grand Duke Cosimo III de' Medici. Deprived of her lover, Charles V of Lorraine, Marguerite Louise despised her husband and his family, whom she often quarrelled with and falsely suspected of attempting to poison her. Marguerite Louise reconciled with the Medici on more than one occasion, however, only to promptly resume hostilities.

Having become Grand Duke of Tuscany upon his father's death, in 1670, Cosimo III, under the sway of his mother, Vittoria della Rovere, refused to grant Marguerite Louise entry to the Privy Council. Thus without political influence, Marguerite Louise sorted the education of her eldest son, Grand Prince Ferdinando. Two more children followed: Anna Maria Luisa, Electress Palatine, and Gian Gastone, the last Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany.

In June 1675, Marguerite Louise was allowed to return to France to live in a convent in Paris. She was a daughter of Gaston de France, Duke of Orléans. Although the contract, banned her from leaving the convent, Marguerite Louise often went to her cousin Louis XIV's court at Versailles. She was at the centre of many scandals at the convent, including an attempt to burn it down, which greatly irritated her husband, who, despite the separation, took great interest in Marguerite Louise's life. While still technically married, Marguerite Louise had several affairs.

Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici

Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici (11 August 1667 – 18 February 1743) was the last of the House of Medici. A patron of the arts, she gave the Medici's large art collection (including the contents of the Uffizi, Palazzo Pitti and Medici villas) which she inherited upon her brother Gian Gastone’s death in 1737, and her Palatine treasures to the Tuscan state, on the condition that none of it be removed.
Anna Maria Luisa was the only daughter of Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Marguerite Louise d'Orléans, a niece of Louis XIII of France. On her marriage to Elector Johann Wilhelm II, she became Electress Palatine, and, patronised a lot of musicians. As Johann Wilhelm had syphilis, the union with Anna Maria Luisa produced no children. In 1713 Cosimo III altered the Tuscan laws of succession to allow the accession of his daughter, and spent his final years canvassing the European powers to agree to recognise this statute. However, in 1735, as part of a territorial arrangement, the European powers appointed Francis Stephen of Lorraine as heir, and he duly ascended the Tuscan throne in her stead. After the death of Johann Wilhelm, Anna Maria Luisa returned to Florence, where she enjoyed the rank of first lady until the accession of her brother Gian Gastone de' Medici, who banished her to the Villa La Quiete.

When Gian Gastone died in 1737, Francis Stephen's envoy offered Anna Maria Luisa the position of regent of Tuscany but she declined. Her death, in 1743, brought the House of Medici to an end.

Political parties in the United States

In the United States of America (USA), there have always been two main parties. Since the 1860's, these two main parties have been the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. The current President of the United States Barack Obama is a Democrat and the Democrats are also the largest party in the Senate. The Republican Party has the most seats in the House of Representatives.

The Democratic Party's first President was Andrew Jackson who was elected in 1828 and many Presidents such as Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and the current President Barack Obama are Democrats. They have 53 out of 100 seats in the U.S. Senate and 189 out of 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Twenty-six out of 50 state governors are also Democrats. The party generally promotes liberalism and is often classed as a centre-left party. Currently, the party has 72 million registered voters across America.

Most Democrats usually agree with the following ideas:


The Republican Party was founded in 1854 as an anti-slavery party and it's first President was Abraham Lincoln in 1861. The party has led America with such figures as Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Harrison, Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. The party has 47 out of 100 seats in the Senate and 240 out of 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Republican John Boehner will become the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives on January 4, 2011. Twenty-four out of 50 states have a Republican governor. It has around 55 million registered voters across America. Currently, the Republican Party is identified as conservative and right-wing.

Not all Republicans believe in all of the same things, but generally these are the things many Republicans support:

There are several minor parties in the United States, none of whom have any seats in the Senate or the House of Representatives.

Cleisthenes

Cleisthenes was a noble Athenian of the Alcmaeonid family. He reformed the constitution of Athens, and set it on a democratic footing in 508/7 BC. For these accomplishments, historians refer to him as "the father of Athenian democracy". He also increased the power of the Assembly, and he broke up power of the Athenian nobility.

With help from the his clan, he overthrew Hippias the tyrant (dictatorial ruler). After the collapse of Hippias' tyranny, Isagoras and Cleisthenes were rivals for power, but Isagoras won the upper hand by appealing to the Spartan king Cleomenes I to help him expel Cleisthenes. 

So Cleisthenes left Athens as an exile, and Isagoras held power in the city. Isagoras uprooted hundreds of people from their homes on the pretext that they were cursed, and attempted to dissolve the Council (βουλή, boulé). However, the Council resisted, and the Athenian people declared their support of it. Hence Isagoras and his supporters were forced to flee to the Acropolis, remaining besieged there for two days. On the third, they fled and were banished. Cleisthenes was subsequently recalled, along with hundreds of exiles, and he assumed leadership of Athens.

<doc id="271198" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=271198" title="Death (personification)">
Death (personification)

Death is a creature that exists in a lot of societies all over history. In English Death is usually given the name Grim Reaper and from the 15th century to now, the Grim Reaper is shown as a human Skeleton holding a scythe and clothed with a black cloak with a hood. It is also given the same of Angel of Death (Hebrew:מלאך המוות, Mal'ach Ha'Mavett), that appeared in the Bible.

In some believes, the Grim Reaper can cause the death of the victim, that created legends that he can be bribed, tricked and make deals to keep the life of someone. In other beliefs, the Grim Reaper guides the dead to the next world, without the knowing of the dead about his death.

In Ancient Greek, the Greeks saw death as good. He is often shown as a bearded, winged man or a young, winged, boy. Death, or Thanatos, is the opposite of Life. Death is represented as a male, and life as a female. He is the twin brother of Hypnos, the god of Sleep.He is discripted as gentle, he escorts the dead to the Underworld, Hades.Then he hands the dead to Charon, who mans a boat that carries the dead to the underworld, threw the river Styx.Thanatos' sisters, Keres, where the spirits of violant death, they where connected with deaths from battle, disease, accident, and murder. They where portrayed as evil, they where feeding on the body of the dead, after the soul was escorted to the Hades. They had fangs, talons, and would be dressed in bloody jewels.

The Welsh portrayed death as Angeu, and for the Bretons it was Ankou, they were the same one. He appeared as a man with a black robe, sometimes carrying a scythe, riding a cart which he collected the dead on it.

In Poland, Death, or "Śmierć", has an appearance that is similar to the our modern Grim Reaper, but instead of a black robe, he wears a White robe.

Lithuanians call death "Giltinė", from the word "gelti"(to sting). Giltinė was shown as an old, ugly, woman with a long blue nose and a poisonous tongue. The legend tells that Giltinė was young, pretty and communicative until she was trapped in a coffin for seven years. The goddess of death was a sister of the goddess of life and destiny, "Laima", symbolizing the relationship between beginning and end.

After it, the Lituanians adopted the classical Grim Reaper with the black cloak and the scythe.

In Hindu texts, the lord of death is called Yama. Yama rides a black buffalo and carries a rope to take the dead to his prison. There are many form of Reapers, they are his agents. They are called "Yamaduts". There, all the man good and bad are stored in an kind of archive. Then Yama take the records out and desides where the soul will be set in the next life, according to the Reincarnation of Hinduism. Yama is also mentioned in the Mahabharata as a philosopher and a devotee of Brahman.

In the Kojiki, after giving birth to the fire god, "Kagu-tsuchi", Izanami dies from wounds of its fire and enters the perpetual night realm called Yomi-no-kuni (the underworld) that the gods retire to and where Izanagi, her husband, travels to in a failed attempt to reclaim her. He discovers his wife as not-so beautiful anymore, and, in a brief argument afterwards between them, she promises to take a thousand lives every day, signifying her position as the goddess of death.

Memitim is a type of angel from the Bible that is connected to the death of the humans. The words is from the hebrew language ממיתים (English:Killers). They are mentioned to kill the people that their guardian angel no longer protects them. There is some debate about the nature of the Memitim among biblical scholars, but it is accepted that, as described in the Book of Job 33:22, they are killers of some kind.

According to the Midrash, the Angel of Death was created by God in the first day of the creation. His house is in Heaven.He has twelve wings."Over all people have I surrendered thee the power," said God to the Angel of Death, "only not over this one which has received freedom from death through the Law".It said that the angel of death is full of eyes. In the time of the death, he stands over the dying one, and waiting for the man to see him. When the dying finally sees him, he drops a gall to the dying's mouth and that is what kills him finally The expression "to taste of death" originated in the idea that death was caused by a drop of gall.

The Angel of Death, who is identified by some with Satan, right after the creation has a dispute with God about the light of the Messiah. When Eve touched the tree of knowledg, the Angel of Death talked to her, and she thought:"Now I shall die, and God will create another wife for Adam". Adam also talked to the Angel of Death. The Angel of Death sits before the face of the dead. While Abraham was mourning, for Sarah the angel appeared to him, which explains why "Abraham stood up from before his death". Samael told Sarah that Abraham had sacrificed Isaac in spite of his wailing, and Sarah died of horror and grief.It was Moses who most often had dealings with the angel. At the resistance of Korah, Moses saw him.

In the Christianity, first there was no creature to death, because God resurrected Jesus and can kill people. Then the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews declared that Satan has the power to control death. One of the beieved that The son, with his death, killed Satan, and by his resurrecting he brought Satan back to life.

It is also believed that the first head of the Beast in the Book of Revelation is the resurrecting of Satan.

In Islam there is the Angel of Death, that is more known with the name ArchAngel of Death, which his name is Azrael. In the Qur'an, he is not mentioned by his name but in the name of "Mal'akkh al Mut" (Angel of Death). He is also descripted in old Hebrew texts as Azrael, the Angel of Death. He is also mentioned in early Christian texts also as Azrael.

Monocalcium phosphate

Monocalcium phosphate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Ca(HPO). It contains phosphate, calcium, and hydrogen ions.

Monocalcium phosphate is a colorless solid. It dissolves a little in water to make an acidic solution. It is made by replacing one of the hydrogen ions in phosphoric acid with a calcium ion. 

It is made by reacting calcium phosphate rock with sulfuric acid. This makes monocalcium phosphate.

It is used in baking powder. When it is dissolved in water, it makes an acidic solution which reacts with the sodium bicarbonate to make carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide makes it rise. It is also used in fertilizers.

In most markets, most affiliates use the network's current Saturday morning schedule. Some, such as Atlanta's WUPA-TV broadcast the block on Sundays. This is usually done because the stations were at one time UPN affiliates and UPN did not have children's television programming on Saturday mornings. Former WB affiliate WCCT-TV in Hartford airs the first three hours of the block on Saturday mornings and the last two hours on Sunday mornings to make room for their own programing.

KMYS in San Antonio, currently the newest CW affiliate has decided to air the block during early Sunday morning and early Monday morning (split into a two-hour and three-hour block) airing before 5am due to its previous commitment of airing Fox's "Weekend Marketplace" infomercial block on Saturday mornings (a holdover from its MyNetworkTV affiliation), along with already existing religious and paid programming on Sunday mornings; this by default will force most younger viewers of the block in that market to record it overnight for later viewing.

Stopping power

Stopping power is a way to measure how powerful a firearm is. Stopping power is a measure of how quickly the gun kills an animal, for instance. Many large animals are not killed after being shot with an ordinary gun and can do damage before they die. Elephant guns, which have much more stopping power, are used to kill the large animal quickly.

TERGV

The TERGV (for "Regional Express Train on high-speed line") is a model to run trains in Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The idea is to run regional trains on lines constructed for "express trains", instead of the "classic lines". This works only in the case that the high-speed line is used only rarely. Running regional trains on such lines slows down the express trains, and costs more than running them on the classic lines. Despite these problems, the concept is very promising for distances between 100 and 200 km. 

There are currently two lines that operate in this manner:
To use these connections, an extra fee must be paid, which is three euros, per day. Another line, Lille to Arras has been opened. This line does not require the extra fee, and has proved very successful.

Blake Clark

Blake Clark (born February 2, 1946) is an American comic character actor, stand-up comedian and voice actor whose trademark is a raspy voice similar to Jim Varney.
He is perhaps best known as Farmer Fran in "The Waterboy". His other known role is as the voice of Slinky Dog in "Toy Story 3", replacing Varney who died in 2000 (and, according to John Lasseter, Clark sounds an "awful lot like him"). Ironically, it was revealed that Clark and Varney had known each other for a long time.
Clark is also a prolific actor, frequently cast in Adam Sandler films.
Clark was born in Macon, Georgia. He graduated from LaGrange College in 1969 with a degree in the performing arts.
A decorated Infantry Platoon Leader in the Vietnam War, Clark brought the plight of the Vietnam Veteran to the people of America in a humorous way in the 80's and was adopted by numerous Veteran Organizations throughout the United States. His personal quote is "I was born and raised in Georgia and fought in Vietnam. It was like being punished for the same thing twice. In fact, I used to have flashbacks "in" Vietnam."
Having moved from his home state of Georgia to Hollywood, Clark soon landed his first "Tonight Show with Johnny Carson" and soon thereafter, was cast in his first of many recurring roles on Television as Fred the Chauffeur on "Remington Steele". Since then, he has been Harry, Tim Taylor's friend on "Home Improvement"; Jules, the next-door neighbor on "The Drew Carey Show"; Chet Hunter, Sean's father on "Boy Meets World", and Bob the womanizing boss on "The Jamie Foxx Show". And he recently received critical acclaim as Drew Barrymore's father in the hit movie, "50 First Dates". He also acted as an umpire in the 2006 film "The Benchwarmers". He even came out in the 2008 film "Get Smart", starring Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway.
Clark has traveled the world doing comedy and recently went to Iraq for an extended USO Tour with Drew Carey. He is a warm, intelligent, funny, and innovative social commentator with a quiet patriotism that he lives as well as portrays. His comedy runs the gamut from observation on the current military conflict to his Southern root in Georgia. He is a man of all seasons.
He has also made special appearances in "Politically Incorrect, Memorial Day, 2001", "Redneck Comedy Roundup", "Redneck Comedy Roundup 2", "Campus Movie Network", "Mancow's Morning Madhouse", "Waste Watch Journal", and others as well.

Planet of the Apes (movie)

Planet of the Apes is an American science fiction film released in 1968 and directed by Franklin J. Schaffner. It was based on the novel "La planète des singes" written by Pierre Boulle and released in 1963. The film stars Charlton Heston and features Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, James Whitmore, James Daly and Linda Harrison. It was released by 20th Century Fox.

The film's story is about an astronaut crew who leave Earth on a deep space mission and crash land on a supposedly alien planet. Ony three out of the four crew members survive the crash and the survivors find the world to be home to a society of apes; including Chimpanzees, Gorillas and Orangutans. These apes have the intelligence of human beings as well as the ability to speak and walk upright like humans. Humans in this society are treated like slaves and live in the wilderness without the ability to speak. At the end of the film, one of the crew members finds the Statue of Liberty and realizes they were on Earth all along.

Planet of the Apes was a box office success, meaning it earned a good amount of money and got highly favourable reviews from critics. The film was given praise for exploring ideas such as class differences, religion, slavery, racism and nuclear technology. It was followed by four sequels: "Beneath the Planet of the Apes" (1970), "Escape from the Planet of the Apes" (1971), "Conquest of the Planet of the Apes" (1972) and "Battle for the Planet of the Apes" (1973). A live action television show was shown in 1974 and an animated television show called "Return to the Planet of the Apes" came out in 1975.

In 2001, a remake of the film was made directed by Tim Burton and starred Mark Wahlberg, Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth. A prequel, which is a film set before the events of its predecessor called "Rise of the Apes" is to be released in 2011 and will star James Franco.

Art movement

An art movement, or "ism", is a style in art. It may have a common philosophy, followed by a group of artists. It may be a label given by a critic to descibe a type of artwork. It is typical of the post-photography era that art explores new directions.

Some art movements can be pinned down to a time and place, or to particular artists. Verbal explanation of movements may come from the artists themselves, sometimes in the form of an art manifesto (published statement). Quite often, a movement is labelled afterwards by some art historian or critic.

Art movements may be connected to similar ideas in architecture, literature, philosophy or even politics. In rough date order:

Conceptual art

Conceptual art is art in which the concepts or ideas involved in the work are more important than traditional aesthetic and material concerns. Many of the works, sometimes called installations, may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions. This method was fundamental to one of the first to appear in print:

Conceptual art even questions the nature of art. Joseph Kosuth elevated this into a definition of art itself in his early manifesto of conceptual art. 

The notion that art should examine its own nature was already part of art critic Clement Greenberg's vision of modern art during the 1950s. With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists began a far more radical analysis of art than was previously done. One of the first things they questioned was the assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of material objects.

Conceptual art has came to mean all contemporary art which does not use the traditional skills of painting and sculpture.

<doc id="271286" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=271286" title="Center of mass">
Center of mass

Center of mass or barycenter of a system is the average position of all the mass in a system.

In a rigid body, the centre of mass is always in the same place. In a loose collection the center of mass may be in space, as it is in the Solar System. Also, as planets' orbits change slightly, so will the position of the barycenter.

A simple way to understand the concept of barycenter is to push a supermarket trolley. If you hold only one corner and push, it will only go in a straight line when you push through the centre of mass. Otherwise a turning force is created. This shows that the mass acts as if it were only in one place.

The center of gravity is a closely related term. It is the point where an object can be balanced perfectly by a sharp point holding it up under the object. It is the center of mass acting in a gravitational field.

The concept of center of mass was first introduced by the ancient Greek physicist, mathematician, and engineer Archimedes of Syracuse. Archimedes showed that the torque (turning force) exerted on a lever by weights resting at various points along the lever is the same as what it would be if all of the weights were moved to a single point — their center of mass. 

Archimedes was the first person to work out ways of finding the center of mass in various objects. 

The center of mass is often called the "center of gravity" because any uniform gravitational field g acts on a system as if the mass "M" of the system were concentrated at the center of mass R.

Marcel Duchamp

Marcel Duchamp (28 July 1887 – 2 October 1968) was a French artist whose work is most often associated with the Dadaist and Surrealist movements. Duchamp's output influenced the development of post-World War I Western art. He advised modern art collectors, such as Peggy Guggenheim and other prominent figures, thereby helping to shape the tastes of Western art during this period.

A playful man, Duchamp challenged conventional thought about artistic processes and art marketing, not so much by writing, but through subversive actions such as dubbing a urinal art and naming it "Fountain". This approach would 50 years later be called conceptual art, though he himself used the term 'ready-mades' for this idea. He produced relatively few artworks, while moving quickly through the avant-garde circles of his time.

The creative act is not performed by the artist alone; the spectator brings the work in contact with the external world by deciphering and interpreting its inner qualifications and thus adds his contribution to the creative act.

Upon his return to Paris in 1923, Duchamp was, in essence, no longer a practicing artist. Instead, he played chess, which he studied for the rest of his life to the exclusion of most other activities.

Duchamp can be seen, very briefly, playing chess with Man Ray in the short film "Entr'acte" (1924) by René Clair. During this period his fascination with chess so distressed his first wife that she glued his pieces to the board. Duchamp continued to play in the French Championships and also in the Chess Olympiads from 1928–1933, favoring hypermodern openings such as the Nimzo-Indian.

COBRA (avant-garde movement)

COBRA (or CoBrA) was a European avant-garde movement active from 1949 to 1951. The name was coined in 1948 by Christian Dotremont from the initials of the members' home cities: Copenhagen (Co), Brussels (Br), Amsterdam (A).

COBRA was formed by Karel Appel, Constant, Corneille, Christian Dotremont, Asger Jorn, and Joseph Noiret on the 8th November 1948 in the Café Notre-Dame, Paris, with the signing of a manifesto, ""La Cause Était Entendue"" ("The Case Was Settled"), drawn up by Dotremont. Formed with a unifying doctrine of complete freedom of colour and form, as well as antipathy towards surrealism, the artists also shared an interest in Marxism as well as modernism.
Their working method was based on spontaneity and experiment, and they drew their inspiration in particular from children’s drawings, from primitive art forms and from the work of Paul Klee and Joan Miró.
Coming together as an amalgamation of the Dutch group Reflex, the Danish group Høst and the Belgian Revolutionary Surrealist Group, the group only lasted a few years but managed to achieve a number of objectives in that time; the periodical "Cobra", a series of collaborations between various members called "Peintures-Mot" and two large-scale exhibitions.
The first of these was held at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, November (1949), the other at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Liège (1951).
In November 1949 the group officially changed its name to 'Internationale des Artistes Expérimentaux' with membership having spread across Europe and the USA, although this name has never stuck. The movement was officially disbanded in 1951, but many of its members remained close, with Dotremont in particular continuing collaborations with many of the leading members of the group.

The primary focus of the group consisted of semi-abstract paintings with brilliant color, violent brushwork, and distorted human figures inspired by primitive and folk art and similar to American action painting. Cobra was a milestone in the development of Tachisme and European abstract expressionism.

Participants in COBRA included:

After this, Tuscany was splintered between the competing republics of Florence, Pisa, Siena, Arezzo, Pistoia and Lucca. Since the 14th century, Florence gained dominance over Pistoia (1306, officially annexed 1530), Arezzo (1384), Pisa (1406), and Siena (1559). Lucca was an independent republic until the Napoleonic period in the 19th century.






"Tuscany was given to France, 1807-1814. Napoleon's sister Elisa Bonaparte was given the honorary title of "Grand Duchess of Tuscany", but did not actually rule over the region."


"Leopoldo II was driven from Tuscany by revolution from 21 February to 12 April 1849, and again on 27 April 1859. He abdicated in favor of his son, Ferdinando IV, on 21 July 1859, but Ferdinando IV was never recognised in Tuscany, and was deposed by the government on 16 August.

The Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (French: "la Ligue de hockey junior majeur du Québec", shortened as "QMJHL" in English, "LHJMQ" in French) is one of the three major junior ice hockey leagues which make up the Canadian Hockey League. Because the name of the league is so long, it is sometimes called the "Q".

There are 18 teams in the QMJHL that are in Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island in Canada, and Maine in the United States. The winner of the QMJHL plays against the winners of the Western Hockey League and Ontario Hockey League for the Memorial Cup. Many good players go from the QMJHL to the National Hockey League, and nine players from the QMJHL are in the Hockey Hall of Fame.

The QMJHL was created in 1969 from two different junior leagues in Quebec, the Quebec Junior Hockey League and the Metropolitan Montreal Junior Hockey League. These two teams wanted to make a better junior league for the province, so combined teams from their leagues. Eight teams were from the QJHL and two from the MMJHL and another team came from a town in Ontario on the Ontario-Quebec border. Nearly every team was within a close distance of Montreal, the largest city in Quebec, though no team played in Montreal.

In 1972 the QMJHL finally wanted a team in Montreal, and tried to get the Montreal Junior Canadiens, who played in the Ontario Hockey Association, to join. The OHA made a deal with the QMJHL and gave them the Junior Canadiens while creating a new team in a different city to keep an OHA team with the same name.

The current tower is the second tower on the site. The original tower was built in 1912. The design was based on the Eiffel Tower. The tower had an cable car that connected it to a nearby amusement park called Luna Park. The original was 64 meters tall. It was the second tallest building in Asia at that time. It quickly became one of the most popular locations in the city. Visitors came from all over. 

There was a fire in 1943 which severely damaged the tower. It was not repaired. The tower was taken apart and the steel was used to make things for World War II.

After the war, citizens wanted to rebuild the popular tower. A private company called "Tsūtenkaku Kanko Co. Ltd." was set up for this purpose. They hired Tachu Naito to design it. He was nicknamed Japan's "Father of Towers". The new tower opened in 1956.

In 1957, Hitachi started putting neon sign advertisements on the tower. The ads have usually been changed every 5 or 6 years. Hitachi last changed the signs in 2006. New signs are scheduled for autumn 2011. The new signs will use LED lights, not neon. Other lights on the tower also show weather information.

Regurgitation

Regurgitation is the process of a human or animal letting out the food it had been digesting. Sometimes, blood can come out as well.

Regurgitation can be very important to some animals, such as birds for example. It is used by a number of species to feed their young. This is especially when the young is in its nest or home and the parent hunts for food. Or some birds can occasionally regurgitate pellets of food that is not digestable, such as bones and feathers. Owls are known to do this.

Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia

Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia (; 6 April 1875 – 20 April 1960) was a daughter of Tsar Alexander III of Russia and the eldest of Czar Nicholas II two sisters. She married her cousin Grand Duke Alexander Mikailovich of Russia and had seven children. During her brother's reign, she lived a private life. However, when monarchy fell, she escaped Russia and lived in England.

Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna was born on 6 April 1875 at Anichkov Palace in St. Petersburg.. Her mother was Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia.

After her grandfather died, her father became the Russian king. At this time, Xenia was six years old. It was difficult political time because of terrorist threats. Alexander III moved with his family from the Winter Palace to the Gatchina Palace to protect his family.

Xenia, like her brothers, was educated by private tutors. She studied foreign languages very much. Apart from her native Russian, Xenia studied English, French, and German. Xenia also learnt how to cook and make puppets and clothes. She liked to ride, fish, draw, play gymnastics, dance, and perform the piano.

Xenia and her first cousin once removed, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia, who would also be her husband, used to play together as friends in the 1880s.. Alexander was also a friend of her brother Nicholas. In 1886, twenty year old Alexander was in the navy. Eleven year old Xenia sent him a card when his ship was in Brazil, "Best wishes and speedy return! Your sailor Xenia". In 1889, Alexander wrote of Xenia, "She is fourteen. I think she likes me."

At age 15, though Xenia and Alexander wanted to marry, her parents did not want to allow them because Xenia was too young. They were also unsure if Alexander was really very nice. The Tsarina Maria Feodorovna complained that Alexander was too proud and rude. It was not until January 1894 that Xenia's parents allowed them to engage. The couple finally wed on 6 August 1894 at Peterhof Palace. Xenia's younger sister, Olga, wrote about the joy of her the wedding, "The Emperor was so happy. It was the last time I ever saw him like that."

Tuner (car)

When talking about cars, a tuner is a car with many parts changed so the car can go very fast. The word "tune" here means "to adjust" or "to change". Typically, people call Japanese fast cars "tuners", comparing to American fast cars. It is because people call American fast cars "muscles".

When people want to drive fast cars but don't want to buy a very expansive car, we can change some parts for an ordinary car to make it go fast.

For basic tuning, we can work on intake and exhaust, which means the process that air goes into the engine and out of the engine. We can also make the frame of the car stronger.

Rage Racer

Rage Racer is a 1996 racing video game by Namco where the player controls different cars and wins races in order to become what the game calls "Rage Racer". Four different car manufacturersmake cars to drive in the game. Each of the cars has its forte and is sometimes named after it. In the game, the player drives three (four later in the game) courses to try and win a trophy and move to the next class.

At the beginning of the game, the game shows a plot of how some elite few "Race Racers" started to race their "worldwide speedway".

In the Grand Prix mode, the player starts at Class 1. They choose a course and then a car. As the player wins races, they win prize money, or "credits", which are called eg in the game. Eg can be used to buy new upgrades, cars, or courses. If the player loses a race, they lose 1 chance. A player starts with 5 chances per class. If a player loses when they do not have any chances, the game ends. Players can still save, and can still retrieve their credit and cars, but medals and trophies are lost.

Time Trial is a mode where the player races the clock. They choose a car and course, and then are shown the record for the track. Tracks are also divided into "sections", parts of a track.

A player can save or load data with a memory card.

<doc id="271477" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=271477" title="Battle of Marathon">
Battle of Marathon

The Battle of Marathon took place in 490 BC, during the first Persian invasion of Greece. It was fought between the citizens of Athens, aided by Plataea, and a Persian force. 

The battle was the result of the first attempt by Persia, under King Darius I, to subjugate Greece. The first Persian invasion was a response to Greek involvement in the Ionian Revolt. 

Then Athens and Eretria had sent a force to support the cities of Ionia in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule. The Athenians and Eretrians had succeeded in capturing and burning Sardis, but were then forced to retreat with heavy losses. In response to this raid, Darius swore to have revenge on Athens and Eretria.

Once the Ionian revolt was finally crushed by the Persian victory at the Battle of Lade, Darius began to plan to subjugate Greece. In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the Aegean, to subjugate the Cyclades, and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria. Reaching Euboea in mid-summer after a successful campaign in the Aegean, the Persians proceeded to besiege and capture Eretria. The Persian force then sailed for Attica, landing in the bay near the town of Marathon. 

The Athenians, joined by a small force from Plataea, marched to Marathon, and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon. Stalemate ensued for five days, before the Athenians (for reasons that are not completely clear) decided to attack the Persians. Despite the numerical advantage of the Persians, the hoplites proved devastatingly effective against the more lightly armed Persian infantry, routing the wings before turning in on the centre of the Persian line.

The defeat at Marathon marked the end of the first Persian invasion of Greece, and the Persian force retreated to Asia. Darius then began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. After Darius died, his son Xerxes I re-started the preparations for a second invasion of Greece, which finally began in 480 BC.

The Battle of Marathon was a watershed in the Greco-Persian wars, showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten; the eventual Greek triumph in these wars can be seen to begin at Marathon. Since the following two hundred years saw the rise of the Classical Greek civilization, which has been enduringly influential in western society, the Battle of Marathon is often seen as a pivotal moment in European history.

For instance, John Stuart Mill famously suggested that "the Battle of Marathon, even as an event in British history, is more important than the Battle of Hastings". The Battle of Marathon is perhaps now more famous as the inspiration for the Marathon race. Although historically inaccurate, the legend of a Greek messenger running to Athens with news of the victory became the inspiration for this athletic event, introduced at the 1896 Athens Olympics, and originally run between Marathon and Athens.

When the Athenian line was ready, according to one source, the simple signal to advance was given by Miltiades: "At them". Most likely, they marched until they reached the limit of the archers' effectiveness, the "beaten zone", (roughly 200 meters), and then broke into a run towards their enemy. Herodotus suggests that this was the first time a Greek army ran into battle in this way; this was probably because it was the first time that a Greek army had faced an enemy composed primarily of missile troops. 

All this was evidently much to the surprise of the Persians; Passing through the hail of arrows launched by the Persian army, protected for the most part by their armour, the Greek line finally collided with the enemy army. Holland provides an evocative description: 
"The enemy directly in their path...realised to their horror that [the Athenians], far from providing the easy pickings for their bowmen, as they had first imagined, were not going to be halted...The impact was devastating. The Athenians had honed their style of fighting in combat with other phalanxes, wooden shields smashing against wooden shields, iron spear tips clattering against breastplates of bronze...in those first terrible seconds of collision, there was nothing but a pulverizing crash of metal into flesh and bone; then the rolling of the Athenian tide over men wearing, at most, quilted jerkins for protection, and armed, perhaps, with nothing more than bows or slings. The hoplites' ash spears, rather than shivering...could instead stab and stab again, and those of the enemy who avoided their fearful jabbing might easily be crushed to death beneath the sheer weight of the advancing men of bronze."

The Athenian wings quickly routed the inferior Persian levies on the flanks, before turning inwards to surround the Persian centre, which had been more successful against the thin Greek centre. The battle ended when the Persian centre then broke in panic towards their ships, pursued by the Greeks. Some, unaware of the local terrain, ran towards the swamps where unknown numbers drowned. The Athenians pursued the Persians back to their ships, and managed to capture seven, though most were able to launch. 

Herodotus records that 6,400 Persian bodies were counted on the battlefield, and it is unknown how many more perished in the swamps. The Athenians lost 192 men and the Plataeans 11.

Weaning

Weaning means changing the diet of a baby mammal, little by little, from its mother's milk to the food it will eat as an adult. Since only mammals make milk, weaning is only a necessary process for mammals. When a baby does not drink any more breast milk (or milk substitute), the baby has been weaned.

Human babies should start eating small amounts of solid food, along with breast milk or formula, when they are about six months old. Before this time, a child's digestive system and kidneys are still forming, so the child is not ready for solid food.

Babies do not have teeth and cannot chew their food, so they are usually fed soft, runny food such as cooked mashed fruit or vegetables. Babies cannot digest some foods which adults can eat, including food with nuts or with large amounts of gluten, salt or sugar. Also, babies' digestive systems are very sensitive to bacteria, so they should not eat any foods with honey, eggs or shellfish in them because these foods sometimes contain bacteria.

Weaning conflict happens when the mother wants to wean her baby, but the baby wants to keep breastfeeding. The mother tries to force the baby to stop breastfeeding, and the baby tries to force the mother to continue. Evolutionary scientists think mammal mothers need to wean their babies as soon as possible, so they will have a greater chance of having more babies and spreading their genes. But mammal babies want to breastfeed as long as they can so they will have a chance to grow strong, and also to enjoy the full care of their mothers. Weaning conflict happens in several mammal species, including primates and canines.

Photocathode

A photocathode is a negatively charged electrode in a light detection device. They are the main type of photomultiplier. That means they take a little light, and make more of it.

There are instruments which need to magnify the amount of light coming in. Examples are astronomical telescopes and military night-sight equipment: binoculars and telescopes on helmets and rifles etc.

The lens of the telescope or binocular passes the light onto a layer of glass coated with a special light-sensitive metal. When this is struck by light, the absorbed energy causes electrons to jump off. This is called the 'photoelectric effect'. The freed electrons are then collected to produce the final image.

These devices are mostly based on alkali metals.

The Space Shuttle Enterprise (OV-101) is a spacecraft used by NASA for testing of the space shuttles. Enterprise was built without engines and without the heat protection system needed for it to travel into space and return to the atmosphere. Enterprise began being built in June 4, 1974, and was completed on September 17, 1976. Enterprise was used for flight tests in 1977. Scientists wanted to test how the shuttle could be transported on top of a Boeing 747. They also did three test manned test flights with the shuttle still joined to the Boeing. When these test were finished they did another five tests with the shuttle flying without engines like a glider. The pilots practiced landing the shuttle at the Edwards Airforce Base. The pilots were astronaut Gordon Fullerton, Apollo 13 astronaut Fred Haise, Joe Engle and Dick Truly. After the test flights, the Enterprise was used for vibration tests at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. After all the tests were finished, some parts of the Enterprise were used in the building of the the other shuttles.

The Enterprise was going to be named the "Constitution", but many people wrote to the President and asked for it to be named after the space craft on the TV show Star Trek. Enterprise can be seen today by visitors to the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Washington, D.C.

David Haye

David Haye is a British boxer. He is the WBA heavyweight champion and is nicknamed "The Hayemaker". He is 1.91 metres (6 feet 3 inches) tall. Before he became a heavyweight, he boxed in the cruiserweight division, where he held all the major titles. His most famous cruiserweight fights were against Jean-Marc Mormeck and Enzo Maccarinell. He has lost only once in his career.

Haye moved up to the heavyweight division and beat Monte Barrett in 2008. In October 2009, he beat Nikolai Valuev, who is 7 feet tall, to become the WBA champion. In 2010, he beat John Ruiz. He defended his title against fellow Briton Audley Harrison in November 2010.

Haye started his career as an amateur. He reached the finals of the 2001 world amateur championship in the heavyweight class, where he lost to Odlanier Solis. He turned professional in the cruiserweight division in December 2002. His first professional fight was meant to be against Valeri Semishkur, but Semishkur pulled out. Instead, Haye fought and beat Tony Booth on 8 December 2002. He had seven fights in 2003, and won all of them. He won his tenth fight in a row when he beat Arthur Williams on 12 May 2004. He won those ten fights with a total of only 20 rounds. In his match against IBO champion Carl Thompson on 10 September 2004, he lost for the first time in his career. In his next match, on 10 December 2004, he beat Semishkur in the first round.

Haye won the European title on 16 December 2006 when he beat Alexander Gurov. He won the match after only 45 seconds. On 24 March 2007, in his first match as European champion, he beat Lasse Johansen. On 27 April 2007, he had his first heavyweight fight, against Tomasz Bonin. Haye won in the first round. Shortly after the fight, Haye said he had plans to move up to the heavyweight division. "I'm absolutely certain I can rule the heavyweight roost", he said. On 10 November 2007, he beat Jean-Marc Mormeck to win the WBA, WBC, and "Ring" magazine titles. Haye was knocked down in the fourth round, but hit Mormeck with a series of blows in the seventh to win by technical knockout. He became the UK's sixth boxing champion. On 8 March 2008, he beat Enzo Maccarinelli to win the WBO title. Haye hit Maccarinelli with two big punches before the referee stopped the match. Haye said he planned to move up to the heavyweight division. A few weeks after the fight, Wladimir Klitschko, the IBF, IBO, and WBO heavyweight champion, said he wanted to fight Haye. 

Haye gave away his titles at cruiserweight and moved up to the heavyweight division. He beat Monte Barrett on 15 November 2008, winning in the fifth round. Before the fight, he said fighting Barrett was a big risk and that he might have retired if he lost. He was meant to fight Wladimir on 20 June 2009, but pulled out. On 31 October 2009, he beat Nikolai Valuev, who is 7 feet tall, to become the WBA champion. Haye was 98 pounds lighter than Valuev; before this fight, no-one had won a heavyweight title match weighing this much less than their opponent. Haye said he has wanted to be the heavyweight champion since he was a toddler. He then beat John Ruiz on 3 April 2010 and Audley Harrison on 13 November 2010. He now says he wants to fight Wladimir or his brother Vitali, who holds the WBC belt. The two brothers are regarded as the best heavyweights in the world. Haye says he plans to retire before his 31st birthday.

Haye was born on 13 October 1980 in Bermondsey, London. He went to Snowsfield primary school and Bacon's College. Jade Goody, winner of the television show "Big Brother", was in his class. Haye is married and has a son called Cassius, named after Cassius Clay, the birth name of Muhammad Ali. His training camp is based in Kyrenia, Northern Cyprus. He started training there in 2007 and sometimes fights with the Northern Cyprus flag on his shorts. He supports the football team Millwall. In September 2010, a newspaper in Northern Cyprus said Haye had become a citizen of Northern Cyprus.

The templates in this series are made to be used in a to make a cell with text in that cell, with a colored background. They are sometimes used in comparison tables.

For example, codice_1 makes a cell with a green background. The text in the cell is taken from the ; codice_2 would output "Sure" otherwise it defaults to "Yes". Most templates allow authors to override the default text in this way, some require text put after the template call and some also need a vertical bar in between: codice_3 or codice_4. This information, the colors and default texts are found in the table below.
Other table attributes, such as codice_5 or codice_6, need a special format. For example, to add colspan or rowspan to table cells, use the format below. The table attribute must be entered before the template call. There must not be a vertical bar codice_7 between the attribute and the template.

Common code to most if not all the templates in this series:

If you find a table cell template that does not take a parameter and you want to be able to change the text in the cell, "do not" duplicate the template! Instead, edit the template and change the text to a default parameter substitution. For example, if a template's text is codice_12, change that to codice_13.

<doc id="271610" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=271610" title="Xanthan gum">
Xanthan gum

Xanthan gum is a polysaccharide (a complex form of sugar). It is added to certain foods, such as salad dressings, to make them thicker. It is also added to cosmetics to keep the ingredients from separating. To make xanthan gum, workers deliberately add a kind of bacterium, "Xanthomonas campestris", to glucose or sucrose. They let the mixture ferment for a while, and then add isopropyl alcohol to separate the polysaccharide from the mixture. They dry the polysaccharide, grind it into a powder, then add it to a liquid. The xanthan gum is then ready to use.

Allene Rosalind Jeanes and her research team at the United States Department of Agriculture first discovered xanthan gum. The team was studying many biopolymers to see whether some of them were useful, and how they could be used. The Kelco Company was the first company to produce xanthan gum in the early 1960s. At that time, Kelco called xanthan gum by its brand name, Kelzan. Later, in 1968, xanthan gum was tested and declared safe to be used in food. The USA, Canada, Europe, and many other regions and countries now accept xanthan gum as a safe food additive.

Xanthan gum is a very effective thickener. It is stable under a wide range of temperatures and pH. Only 0.5% of xanthan gum is added to most foods to thicken them. The thickening property of xanthan gum decreases when a food is mixed, shaken or chewed, but it thickens up again when the force is removed. This property is called pseudoplasticity. Sometimes this property can be very useful. For instance, the xanthan gum added to salad dressing makes the dressing thick enough to cling to a salad, but shaking the bottle of dressing makes it temporarily thin and easier to pour.

Salad dressings and sauces contain xanthan gum. Even though xanthan gum is not an emulsifier, it helps to keep an emulsion stable so that the oil in it does not separate. Xanthan gum also helps to keep spices and other solid bits of food evenly distributed in a liquid. Xanthan gum, guar gum and locust bean gum help to give ice cream and other frozen foods a creamy texture. Gluten-free bakers use xanthan gum instead of gluten to make bread dough or batter "sticky." Packaged egg whites or egg substitutes contain xanthan gum to replace the fat and emulsifiers found in egg yolks.

Toothpaste often contains xanthan gum to give the toothpaste a smooth texture. People who have trouble swallowing add xanthan gum to drinks and other liquids to make them thicker and easier to swallow.

Oil drillers use a lot of xanthan gum to make drilling mud thicker. This thick fluid helps carry solids cut by the drill bit up to the surface of the earth. When people need to pour concrete underwater, they add xanthan gum to the concrete to make it thicker and keep it from washing away.

Many cosmetics contain xanthan gum, which helps hold together oil and water emulsions. Xanthan gum can also help keep skin moist. Fake blood, toy slime and gunge all get their thickness from xanthan gum.

Workers who were exposed to xanthan gum dust developed allergy-like symptoms from breathing in the dust.

Coeliac disease sufferers and other people who are sensitive to gluten and other allergens may need to be careful how much xanthan gum is in their food. Some types of xanthan gum are made with wheat, corn or soy and could cause allergic reactions. Xanthan gum is also a strong laxative and can cause diarrhoea in people who eat too much of it, or who are sensitive to it.

Egyptian embalming process

The Egyptians believe that once a body is mummified and set, the corpse's spirit may find the body so it may begin its journey to the afterlife.
First the Egyptians shoved a hook up the person's nose, jiggled it around a little bit, then let the brain drain out the person's nose. They then cut a small slit in the stomach to reach up and get the lungs, liver, intestines, and stomach out, and placed them in the correct Canopic Jars. When they finished mummifying those, they coated the whole body with natron. They let it sit for 40 days, then put herbs and scents on the body, for each had a special power.

As the embalmers wrapped the mummy in fine linen, they placed amulets in between the layers of cloth for good luck and such. When the body was finished, a death mask was placed on it, and it was set in a series of containers, finishing with a stone coffin.
Many of the pharaoh's things were placed with him, as well as some guards, wives, and pets.

Environmentally friendly

Environmentally friendly (also eco-friendly, nature friendly, and green) are terms that refer to objects that people buy (called "goods"), services, laws, and rules that either do not harm the environment or do very little harm to it. To make people who buy the goods or services know that they are environmentally friendly, environmentally friendly goods and services often are marked with "eco-labels". But because there is no single type of eco-label, the International Organization for Standardization thinks that these labels do not mean much because they could mean different things.

Environmentally friendly is a term used to refer to goods and services, laws, guidelines and policies claimed to inflict minimal or no harm on the environment. Companies sometimes use these terms to promote goods and services by making environmental marketing claims and with eco-labels. Also ecofriendly, by 1993, from eco- + friendly.

It's hard to imagine what the world would have been like without Wikipedia... a very dull world. Everyone is entitled to a good education and to have information readily available, that's Wikipedia's goal and that's what's been done for the past 10 years, with more multilingual projects opening their doors and expanding.

Wikipedia, its sister projects and the Wikimedia Foundation bring to the world, free knowledge accessible by everyone, for everyone and contributed to by everyone. That's what sets us apart from every other encyclopedia. Were it not for the community, we would not have such a large repository, or collection if you will, of knowledge and the world would still be using boring out-of-date encyclopedias, which sets us apart because if you see something wrong or inaccurate you can just edit it, whereas in Encyclopedia Brittanica you can't... well you can use liquid paper but once an issue is published that's it, no more corrections.

Think about it.

Iodic acid

Iodic acid is a chemical compound. It is also an acid. Its chemical formula is HIO. It contains hydrogen and iodate ions. The iodine is in its +5 oxidation state.

Iodic acid is a white solid that can dissolve in water to make an acidic solution. Chloric acid and bromic acid only exist in solution and break down when crystallized. Iodic acid is a strong oxidizing agent. It can be converted to iodine pentoxide when it is heated gently. If it is heated strongly, it decomposes into iodine, oxygen, and other iodine oxides. 

It can form several things when it is reduced. If there is a lot of reducing agent, it is reduced to iodide. If there is a lot of iodic acid, it is reduced to iodine. If there is a lot of chloride, then it is reduced to iodine trichloride, a yellow liquid.

It can be made by electrolysis of an acidic iodide solution. 

Iodic acid is used to make other iodates by reacting bases with iodic acid. It is also used as a strong acid.

Japanese Occupation of Singapore

The Japanese Occupation of Singapore is a time from 1942-1945 (during World War II) where the Japanese occupied Singapore. The occupation started after the army of Japan defeated the garrison of Australian, British Malaya, Britain, and India. This was at the Battle of Singapore. It was officially returned to the British after the peace treaty ending World War II was signed. 

The Japanese did not treat the people very well during their occupation. They tried to kill all anti-Japanese people. There was a large amount of inflation because the Japanese printed paper money for Singapore to use.

In 1941, due to the weak defenses of the country, the Japanese attacked Singapore. They took control of the colony on 15 February 1942 and renamed it Syonan-to (pronounced as Sho-nan-to), meaning Light of the South, during the rule. Many people suffered during this time till the British got back Singapore in September 1945.

Ligand

A ligand is a biochemical substance. Its function is to bind to a biological molecule, and make the molecule perform a function. Ligand binding alters the shape of the receptor protein. This changes the protein's behaviour. 

In a narrower sense, it is a signal triggering molecule, binding to a site on a target protein.

The binding occurs by intermolecular forces, such as ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces. The docking (association) is usually reversible (dissociation). 

Ligands include substrates, inhibitors, activators, and neurotransmitters. The tendency or strength of binding is called affinity.

Polyxena of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg (Polyxena Christina Johanna; 21 September 1706 – 13 January 1735) was the second wife of Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Piedmont, future Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia.

Polyxena was born at Langenschwalbach in Hesse and was baptised with the names "Polyxena Christina Johanna ". King Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia approached her family and proposed a union between Polyxena and Victor Amadeus II's son and heir Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Piedmont. A previous match orchestrated by Agostino Steffani with a daughter of Rinaldo d'Este, Duke of Modena had come to nothing. His first wife, Anne Christine of Sulzbach died March 1723 having given birth to a son.

The engagement was announced on 2 July 1724. The marriage was celebrated in person at Thonon in Chablais on 20 August 1724. The happy marriage produced six children.

Praised as an attractive, cultured and kind woman, Polyxena founded a home for penniless mothers in Turin in 1732, redecorated the "Villa della Regina", the hunting lodge of Stupingi, and the Church of Saint Giuseppe in Turin. She popularised "chinoiserie". She was also a patron of Giovanni Battista Crosato, a baroque painter.

Having been ill since June 1734, she died at the Royal Palace of Turin. Originally buried at the Cathedral of Saint Giovanni Battista, she was moved to the Royal Basilica of Superga in 1786 by her son Victor Amadeus III. Two years after her death, her husband married Elisabeth Therese of Lorraine, sister of the future Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor.

Elisabeth Therese of Lorraine (Élisabeth Thérèse de Lorraine; 15 October 1711 – 3 July 1741) was born a Princess of Lorraine and a Queen of Sardinia as wife Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia. She was a of Francis Stephan, Duke of Lorraine.

Élisabeth Thérèse of Lorraine was born at the Château de Lunéville and was the ninth of eleven children of Leopold Joseph of Lorraine and his wife Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans. Her mother was a niece of Louis XIV. 

Her mother wanted her to marry her cousin Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans but the Duke of Orléans refused. As a result Elisabeth Therese was created the "coadjutrice" of Remiremont Abbey in October 1734.

In 1736 her brother the Duke of Lorraine married the Maria Theresa of Austria, daughter of Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor. The already twice widowed Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia asked for her hand in late 1736 and the marriage went ahead. 

The couple married in person on 1 April 1737. Charles Emmanuel III was her first cousin, his mother being Anne Marie d'Orléans – a half sister of her mother Élisabeth Charlotte. The marriage produced three children, only one of whom survived infancy.

Élisabeth Thérèse died at the Palace of Venaria aged 29, having fallen ill with a fever after childbirth. She was buried in the Cathedral of Saint Giovanni Battista in Turin. She was moved to the Royal Basilica of Superga in 1786 by her stepson Victor Amadeus III.

The dot product contrasts (in three dimensional space) with the cross product, which produces a vector as result.

The dot product of two vectors a = ["a", "a", ... , "a"] and b = ["b", "b", ... , "b"] is defined as:
where Σ denotes summation notation ( the sum of all the terms) and "n" is the dimension of the vector space.

In dimension 2, the dot product of vectors [a,b] and [c,d] is ac + bd.
The same way, in a dimension 3, the dot product of vectors [a,b,c] and [d,e,f] is ad + be + cf.
For example, the dot product of two three-dimensional vectors [1, 3, −5] and [4, −2, −1] is

In Euclidean geometry, the dot product, length, and angle are related. For a vector a, the dot product a · a is the square of the length of a, or

where ||a|| denotes the length (magnitude) of a. More generally, if b is another vector

where ||a|| and ||b|| denote the length of a and b and "θ" is the angle between them.

This formula can be rearranged to determine the size of the angle between two nonzero vectors:

One can also first convert the vectors to unit vectors by dividing by their magnitude:
then the angle "θ" is given by

As the cosine of 90° is zero, the dot product of two orthogonal(perpendicular) vectors is always zero. Moreover, two vectors can be considered orthogonal if and only if their dot product is zero, and they both have a nonzero length. This property provides a simple method to test the condition of orthogonality.

Sometimes these properties are also used for "defining" the dot product, especially in 2 and 3 dimensions; this definition is equivalent to the above one. For higher dimensions the formula can be used to define the concept of angle.

The geometric properties rely on the basis being orthonormal, i.e. composed of pairwise perpendicular vectors with unit length.

If both a and b have length one (i.e., they are unit vectors), their dot product simply gives the cosine of the angle between them.

If only b is a unit vector, then the dot product a · b gives |a| cos(θ), i.e., the magnitude of the projection of a in the direction of b, with a minus sign if the direction is opposite. This is called the scalar projection of a onto b, or scalar component of a in the direction of b (see figure). This property of the dot product has several useful applications (for instance, see next section).

If neither a nor b is a unit vector, then the magnitude of the projection of a in the direction of b, for example, would be a · (b / |b|) as the unit vector in the direction of b is b / |b|.

A rotation of the orthonormal basis in terms of which vector a is represented is obtained with a multiplication of a by a rotation matrix R. This matrix multiplication is just a compact representation of a sequence of dot products.

For instance, let
Then the rotation from "B" to "B" is performed as follows:

Notice that the rotation matrix R is assembled by using the rotated basis vectors u, v, w as its rows, and these vectors are unit vectors. By definition, Ra consists of a sequence of dot products between each of the three rows of R and vector a. Each of these dot products determines a scalar component of a in the direction of a rotated basis vector (see previous section).

If a is a row vector, rather than a column vector, then R must contain the rotated basis vectors in its columns, and must post-multiply a:

In physics, magnitude is a scalar in the physical sense, i.e. a physical quantity independent of the coordinate system, expressed as the product of a numerical value and a physical unit, not just a number. The dot product is also a scalar in this sense, given by the formula, independent of the coordinate system. 
Example:

The following properties hold if a, b, and c are real vectors and "r" is a scalar.

The dot product is commutative:

The dot product is distributive over vector addition:

The dot product is bilinear:

When multiplied by a scalar value, dot product satisfies:
(these last two properties follow from the first two).

Two non-zero vectors a and b are perpendicular if and only if a • b = 0.

Unlike multiplication of ordinary numbers, where if "ab" = "ac", then "b" always equals "c" unless "a" is zero, the dot product does not obey the cancellation law:

Provided that the basis is orthonormal, the dot product is invariant under isometric changes of the basis: rotations, reflections, and combinations, keeping the origin fixed. The above mentioned geometric interpretation relies on this property. In other words, for an orthonormal space with any number of dimensions, the dot product is invariant under a coordinate transformation based on an orthogonal matrix. This corresponds to the following two conditions:

If a and b are functions, then the derivative of a • b is a' • b + a • b'

This is a very useful identity (also known as Lagrange's formula) involving the dot- and cross-products. It is written as

which is easier to remember as "BAC minus CAB", keeping in mind which vectors are dotted together. This formula is commonly used to simplify vector calculations in physics.

Consider the element of R
Repeated application of the Pythagorean theorem yields for its length |v|
But this is the same as
so we conclude that taking the dot product of a vector v with itself yields the squared length of the vector.

Now consider two vectors a and b extending from the origin, separated by an angle θ. A third vector c may be defined as
creating a triangle with sides a, b, and c. According to the law of cosines, we have
Substituting dot products for the squared lengths according to Lemma 1, we get
But as c ≡ a − b, we also have
which, according to the distributive law, expands to
Merging the two c • c equations, "(1)" and "(2)", we obtain
Subtracting a • a + b • b from both sides and dividing by −2 leaves
Q.E.D.

The inner product generalizes the dot product to abstract vector spaces and is usually denoted by formula_26. Due to the geometric interpretation of the dot product the norm ||a|| of a vector a in such an inner product space is defined as

such that it generalizes length, and the angle θ between two vectors a and b by

In particular, two vectors are considered orthogonal if their inner product is zero

For vectors with complex entries, using the given definition of the dot product would lead to quite different geometric properties. For instance the dot product of a vector with itself can be an arbitrary complex number, and can be zero without the vector being the zero vector; this in turn would have severe consequences for notions like length and angle. Many geometric properties can be salvaged, at the cost of giving up the symmetric and bilinear properties of the scalar product, by alternatively defining
where "b" is the complex conjugate of "b". Then the scalar product of any vector with itself is a non-negative real number, and it is nonzero except for the zero vector. However this scalar product is not linear in b (but rather conjugate linear), and the scalar product is not symmetric either, since
This type of scalar product is nevertheless quite useful, and leads to the notions of Hermitian form and of general inner product spaces.

The Frobenius inner product generalizes the dot product to matrices. It is defined as the sum of the products of the corresponding components of two matrices having the same size.

The dot product between a tensor of order n and a tensor of order m is a tensor of order n+m-2. The dot product is worked out by multiplying and summing across a single index in both tensors. If formula_32 and formula_33 are two tensors with element representation formula_34 and formula_35 the elements of the dot product formula_36 are given by

This definition naturally reduces to the standard vector dot product when applied to vectors, and matrix multiplication when applied to matrices.

Occasionally, a double dot product is used to represent multiplying and summing across two indices. The double dot product between two 2nd order tensors is a scalar.

Zapatista Army of National Liberation

The EZLN, in Spanish Ejército Zapatista de la Liberación Nacional, or Zapatista Army of National Liberation is a human rights organization led by the indigenous people of the Chiapas Mountains in the southeast of Mexico. The name Zapatista refers to Emiliano Zapata who was a leader of the Mexican Revolution of 1910.

Though the movement has many leaders, both women and men, Marcos has become the unofficial spokesperson for the movement. This is because he is very well educated, a good public speaker, and has written letters to and worked with writers and intellectuals from all over the world. He signs almost all of his letters with "Subcomandante Marcos, from the mountains of the southeast of Mexico." He is wearing a ski-mask in every picture and video of him and ski-masks have become a symbol of the EZLN in Mexico, as the majority of its supporters also wear them. Followers of the EZLN also paint murals of Marcos in his mask and Emiliano Zapata to show their support.

Denny Hamlin

James Dennis Alan "Denny" Hamlin (born November 18, 1980 in Chesterfield, Virginia)

Hamlin started his racing career in 1988, at the age of 7 years old, racing Go-Karts. At the age of 16, he was racing Ministocks. In his first stock car race, at Langley Speedway, Hamlin won the pole position, and won the race. In 2004, while racing full time in Late Model Stock Cars, Hamlin was signed to a development program with Joe Gibbs Racing.

In 2004, Hamlin raced in five NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series (NCTS) races with the team EJP Racing. He finished tenth in his first race, at Indianopolis Raceway Park. He ran his first ARCA RE/MAX Series race at Talladega Superspeedway, finishing third in the #10 Pontiac owned by Andy Hillenburg. His last start of the year came at Darlington Raceway, when he started his first Busch Series race. He started twenty-seventh but finished eighth in the #18 Joe Gibbs Driven Performance Oil Chevrolet.

Hamlin raced the full season in the #20 Rockwell Automation Chevrolet in the Busch Series. He finished 5th in the final championship points standings as a rookie in that series. Hamlin also raced in his first Nextel Cup Series races in 2005, making his Cup first start at Kansas Speedway as driver of the #11 FedEx Chevrolet. He made seven starts in in the Sprint Cup series in 2005. He finished the Sprint Cup season with three top 10 finishes in seven starts and one pole at Phoenix International Raceway.

In 2006, Hamlin raced his first full season in the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series. He also drove in the Busch Series full-time. In Hamlin's first race as a Nextel Cup driver, he won the 70-lap 2006 Budweiser Shootout. Hamlin became the first Rookie to win the Budweiser Shootout. Hamlin got his first career Busch Series win at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez on March 5th 2006. On June 11 2006, Hamlin won his first career Nextel Cup Series race at the Pocono 500. He got his second career win on July 23, in the Pennsylvania 500, also at Pocono Raceway. In the Nextel Cup Series, Hamlin won the Raybestos Rookie of the Year award and finished third in the final standings.

In 2007 Denny Hamlin finished 12th overall in the final standings in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. In the Nationwide Series, Hamlin won three races, Darlington, Michigan, and Dover in the #20 Rockwell Automation Chevy.

In 2008, Hamlin finished 8th in the Sprint Cup Series and won early in the season at Martinsville Speedway. He won three races in the Nationwide Series, driving both the #18 and #20 cars for Joe Gibbs Racing, as well as the #32 Dollar General/Haas Avocados car for Braun Racing.

In 2009 Hamlin won his fifth career race at Pocono Raceway on August 3, 2009. The win was Hamlin's third at Pocono. It was an emotional win for Hamlin as his grandmother, Thelma Clark, died the Friday before the race. 

Hamlin also won races at Martinsville Speedway, his home track Richmond International Raceway, and the last race of the year at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Hamlin ended the season 5th in the Sprint Cup Series points.

On January 22, 2010, Denny Hamlin tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while playing basketball. 
On March 27, 2010 Hamlin said he was going to have surgery on his left knee the next Monday. If he did not have the surgery, his knee would have been injured worse.

Three weeks after his surgery on April 19, 2010, Hamlin won the race at Texas Motor Speedway. It was the 10th win of his career.

Later in the season Hamlin finished 43rd in a race at Atlanta Motor Speedway. This was the first time that Denny Hamlin finished last in a race. This race moved Hamlin into 10th place in the Sprint Cup Series points, and made sure he would have a place in the championship race. Denny Hamlin won 8 races in the 2010 Sprint Cup Series but finished the season 2nd in Sprint Cup Series points behind Jimmie Johnson.

Cornelius Dennis "Mad Dog" Madigan (born October 4, 1934, in Port Arthur, Ontario) is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman notable for being the oldest rookie in National Hockey League history.

After playing several years in senior leagues in Ontario and British Columbia in the late 1950s, Madigan had a long career as a minor league star, most notably with the Fort Wayne Komets of the International Hockey League for three seasons in the early 1960s, and then for the Portland Buckaroos of the Western Hockey League for nine seasons. He won accolades as First Team league All-Star in 1960, 1966, 1967, 1968 and 1969, Second Team All-Star in 1965, 1971 and 1972, as well as winning best defenceman honors in 1966.

In the 1972–73 NHL season, the St. Louis Blues of the NHL bought Madigan's rights from the Buckaroos, and he joined the Blues in January 1973 at the age of 38, becoming the oldest rookie ever. He played for the Blues in twenty regular-season games and five playoff games, before finishing his career with Portland in parts of the two successive seasons.

At the time of his retirement, Madigan was second in minor league history in career penalty minutes, and is still 62nd in that category. 

In addition to Madigan's hockey career, he had a minor role in the 1977 cult classic movie "Slap Shot" as legendary hockey goon Ross "Mad Dog" Madison.

Western Grey Kangaroo

The Western Grey Kangaroo ("Macropus fuliginosus") is a large and very common kangaroo or macropod. It lives right across the southern part of Australia. They live from just south of Shark Bay in Western Australia to western Victoria. In South Australia they live along the coast. They also live in the Murray-Darling Basin in New South Wales and Queensland. The subspecies on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, is called the Kangaroo Island Kangaroo.

The Western Grey Kangaroo is one of the largest kangaroos. It weighs 28–54 kg and its length is 0.84-1.1m with a 80–100 cm tail, and is about 1.3m tall. It exhibits sexual dimorphism with the male up to twice the size of female. It has thick, coarse fur with colour ranging from pale grey to brown. It has a paler color on its throat, chest and belly. It feeds at night, mainly on grasses but also on leafy shrubs and low trees. It has a nickname "Stinker" because mature males have a curry-like odour.

The kangaroo lives in groups of up to 15. The males compete for females during the breeding season. During these "boxing" contests, they would lock arms and try to push each other over. Usually, only the strongest male in the group mates. The gestation period is 30–31 days. After the birth, the tiny baby Joey attaches to the teat in the females pouch for nine months. After it comes out of the pouch, it will continue to drink milk from the mother's pouch for about another nine months.

Long known to the Aboriginal people of Australia, for Europeans, the Western Grey was the centre of a great deal of sometimes comical taxonomic confusion for almost 200 years. It was first noted by European settlers when the great explorer Matthew Flinders landed on Kangaroo Island in 1802. Flinders shot several for food but assumed that they were Eastern Grey Kangaroos. In 1803 French explorers captured several Kangaroo Island Western Greys and shipped them home to Paris, where they lived in the zoological gardens for some years. Eventually, researchers at the Paris Museum of Natural History recognised that these animals were indeed different and formally described the species as "Macropus fuliginosus" in 1817. Unfortunately, for reasons that remain unclear, it was described as native to Tasmania. 

There the matter rested for over 100 years, and it was not until 1917 that researchers realised that the "Forester Kangaroo" of Tasmania was in fact "Macropus giganteus", the same Eastern Grey Kangaroo that was, and still is, widespread in the more fertile south-eastern part of the mainland. By 1971, it was understood that the Kangaroo Island species was the same as the kangaroos of southern Western Australia, and that this population extended through much of the eastern part of the continent as well. For a time, three subspecies were described, two on the mainland and one on Kangaroo Island. Finally, by the early 1990s, the current understanding emerged.

There are two subspecies of the Western Grey: "Macropus fuliginosus fuliginosus" which lives on Kangaroo Island, and "Macropus fuliginosus melanops", which has a range of different types that change gradually from west to east. 

The Western Grey does not live in the tropical north or the fertile south-east of Australia. The Eastern Grey does not live over the NSW-South Australia border, but the two species are both common in the Murray-Darling Basin area. They never interbreed in the wild, although hybrids between Eastern Grey females and Western Grey males have been produced in captivity.

The Western Grey Kangaroo is also called the Black-faced Kangaroo, Mallee Kangaroo, Sooty Kangaroo and Carno Kangaroo.

Traditional animation

Traditional animation is much harder than today's style of animation. It often uses a stop-motion camera to "liven", or animate, the photos made by the producer. When movie-makers use stop-motion, they need to draw one picture for every scene. However, there are tools to help save time with movie-making. Other types of animation, such as limited or digital animation, can also be used now. FPS is the number of times a film is shot in one second.

The photographer first shoots out or edits many photos. These photos are combined to make the storyline. And as with all movies, not all scenes make it into the final movie.

Many people help out in the editing of a film. But in old times, people had to draw the scenes on their own. Then the stop-motion camera took a photo of a scene once a second. 

Most movies or cartoons in the 1950's required very hard work of the editors. To make things cheaper, though, people made limited animation that used two to three copies of the same image (so the stop-motion process would be two to three times faster.)

Right now movie-makers use digital animation to "liven the movie even more". Movies from the 2000 to 2010 years are usually 1-2 hours long.

FPS, or "frames per second", is the number of scenes being shot in one second. The higher this is, the more "smooth" the film looks. Most films have an FPS of 24 to 60.

Cels, or celluloids, are tools used to "preserve" scenes. An editor uses a cell to draw a scene then make changes to it on the next drawing. It is useful when a cartoon or movie involves moving figures or objects.

Sometimes a sketch pad is used to draft the scenes the editors think would be good in the movie. A sketchpad at first may contain a comic book that looks like an animation when the editors flip it back and forth.

Often editors preview the animation with a video shower. On the stream of scenes, movie-makers test their animation and fix bugs or problems.

Milarepa

Milarepa (c. 1052—1135) is the most famous yogi, poet and Buddhist saint of Tibet. A collection of his teachings in the form of poetic songs called "The Hundred Thousand songs of Milarepa", and his biography "The Life of Milarepa" are two of the most popular books in Tibet. 

Milarepa was a student of Marpa and the teacher of Gampopa. Together these three (Marpa, Milarepa and Gampopa) are considered to be the founders of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism.

Milarepa was botn born in the village of Kya Ngatsa in the Gungthang province of western Tibet to a family of farmers. He was named Mila Thöpaga, which means ""Mila, a joy to hear."" When his father died, Milarepa's uncle and aunt took all of the family's wealth and property and mistreated Milarepa, his mother and sister. At his mother's urging, Milarepa left home and studied magic so that he could take revenge on his uncle and aunt. 

While his aunt and uncle were having a party to celebrate the marriage of their son, Mila took his revenge by summoning a great hail storm to demolish their house, which killed 35 people. The villagers were angry and set off to look for Milarepa, but his mother got word to him and he sent anther hailstorm to destroy their crops.

Mila later came to regret his evil actions and so became determined to practice the Buddha's teachings. Setting out to find a teacher, he was eventually led to Marpa the translator. Marpa proved a harsh task master. Before Marpa would teach Mila, he had him build and then demolish three towers in turn and go through many other trials. Eventually Mila was granted the teachings of the Six Yogas of Naropa and Mahamudra. After practicing these teacings very diligently for twelve years in remote Himalayan caves of Tibet and Nepal, Mila attained the complete enlightenment. He is said to be the first to achieve this state within one lifetime. During his meditation practice he ate mostly nettle soup which made his his skin turn green, and wore only a single cotton robe. He became known as Milarepa, which means the "Mila, the cotton clad one" 

Later Milarepa become a wandering teacher and attracted many disciples, of whom the most well known were Rechungpa and Gampopa. Rechungpa followed the yogic lifestyle of his teacher while Gampopa, a Kadampa monk, eventually established a monastery a Daglha Gampo which became the first Kagyu institution. Later Gampopa's immediate disciples and their successors established the various branches of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism.

Dennis Brain

Dennis Brain (born 17 May 1921; died London, 1 September 1957) was a British horn player. During his short life he became world-famous. Many people thought of him as the greatest horn player ever. He made the horn very popular among classical music lovers in Britain. His recordings include the four horn concertos by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart which he recorded with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Herbert von Karajan.

Dennis Brain was born in London on 17 May 1921. Several of his family were horn players, including his father Aubrey, his grandfather Alfred Edwin Brain Sr and his uncle Alfred Edwin Brain Jr. His mother Marion was a singer who had sung at Covent Garden. He had a brother Leonard who was 6 years older and who was to become an excellent oboe player.

Dennis started to learn the piano. He also played bugle in the school cadet band at Richmond Hill Preparatory School. From there he was sent to St Paul’s School in Kensington where he sang in the choir and played piano solos at concerts. In 1936 he left school and got a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music where he learned the horn with his father as well as the piano and, from 1938, the organ. He learned a lot from his organ teacher G.D.Cunningham who had taught his uncle Alfred the piano some 40 years before.

Dennis’s first professional concert was at the Queen’s Hall in 1938 when he played Bach’s Brandenburg Concerto no 1 together with his father (there are important solo parts for two horns in this music). Soon he was playing in other concerts and making gramophone recordings.

The outbreak of World War II in 1939 interrupted his last year of studies. All theatre halls and concert-halls were closed. He managed to get a job as principal horn with the RAF Central Band which were in Uxbridge in north-west London. Dennis was always a very friendly person who got on well with everybody. The older players in the band might not have liked a 17 year-old boy to have a principal’s job, but everybody realized he had exceptional skills. He played in concerts whenever possible. There were lunch-hour concerts in the National Gallery during the war, and he often played in these. He started to become famous. He met Benjamin Britten and he persuaded him to compose his "Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings". He performed it in 1943 with the tenor Peter Pears and they recorded it for Decca in 1944. He toured the USA with the RAF Orchestra. Several conductors heard him and wanted Brain to join their orchestra.

By 1945, Brain was the most famous horn player in England. He was still only 24. His father hurt himself in a fall and could not play much. Dennis took over some of his work. After the war two new orchestras were formed in London: the Philharmonia and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Brain was made principal horn player in both. Later, he left the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra because he did not have time.

Brain played a lot of chamber music, forming a wind quintet with his brother in 1946. This group got bigger and toured to Germany, Italy and Austria. Brain also started a trio with the pianist Wilfrid Parry and violinist Jean Pougnet. The trio toured Scotland twice and there were plans to tour Australia in the winter of 1957. 

In November 1953 Brain recorded the Mozart Horn Concertos Nos. 1–4 for EMI with the Philharmonia Orchestra with Karajan conducting. He kept up his organ playing (his teacher had hoped he would become an organist) and in July 1954, again conducted by Karajan, Brain performed the organ part in a recording of the Easter hymn from Pietro Mascagni's "Cavalleria rusticana". 

In 1955 Brain became known to millions of people when he presented a radio program called "The Early Horn". 

Brain had a good sense of humour. Among the many concerts he played in was a music festival in 1956 which celebrated the life of Gerard Hoffung, the artist who had drawn many cartoons about music. Dennis played a Leopold Mozart horn concerto by blowing through rubber hose pipes. He cut the hose to the length he needed with garden shears so that it was perfectly in tune. 

Brain was known for being careless. The horn he played for many years had lots of dents in it because he kept knocking it or dropping it. Benjamin Britten gave him a second copy of music for a new work he had written. Inside he wrote: "For Dennis - in case he loses the other one". His Alexander horn was badly damaged in his fatal crash. Normally it would have been thrown away, but it was saved and was restored by Paxmans of London and can be seen in the Royal Academy of Music's free museum.

Brain often asked composers to write new works for him to perform. Many composers wrote for him without even being asked. Among them were Benjamin Britten "Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings", "Canticle III", Malcolm Arnold "Horn Concerto No. 2", Paul Hindemith "Concerto for Horn and Orchestra", York Bowen "Concerto for Horn, Strings and Timpani", Peter Racine Fricker "Horn Sonata" (Dennis was at school with Peter), Gordon Jacob "Concerto for Horn and String Orchestra", Mátyás Seiber "Notturno" for Horn and Strings", Humphrey Searle "Aubade" for Horn and Strings, Ernest Tomlinson "Rhapsody and Rondo" for Horn and Orchestra, "Romance and Rondo" for Horn and Orchestra, Lennox Berkeley "Trio for Horn, Violin and Piano" and Elisabeth Lutyens.

Brain also made the two horn concertos by Richard Strauss very popular. He was the second to perform the "Horn Concerto No. 2" in public in 1948.

Apart from horns Dennis had one big passion: he loved cars. At orchestral rehearsals he often had a car magazine on the music stand instead of his music (he knew the music from memory anyway). His first car was an open Morris 8 with two seats. He shared it during the war with his brother to motor from Uxbridge into London. Later he had several cars. Whenever a car did not work he bought another instead of repairing it. He loved to drive and would often drive all the way home after a concert even it was 100s of miles. Elisabeth Schwarzkopf let him drive her huge Hudson saloon car over the Gotthard Pass in Switzerland when it was officially closed because of heavy snow. On another occasion Herbert von Karajan let him drive his Mercedes 300SL. Once he bought a very rare 1939 12-cylinder Lagonda, but he soon crashed it and it could not be repaired. Other cars included a Citroen and a green TR2 sports car.

On 31 August 1957 Dennis was at the Edinburgh Festival playing a concert in the Usher Hall. The Philharmonia Orchestra were playing Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 6, "Pathetique" with the conductor Eugene Ormandy. Unusually that day he seemed tired and Ormandy told him he should get more rest. But Dennis had a recording session the next morning in London, so after the concert he got into his car (his TR2), put his horn on the back seat and set off on the 380-mile journey back home.

It was about 6.00am the next morning when he was near London. It was raining heavily and he was on the A1 at the Barnet by-pass. According to witnesses he was travelling very fast when he came to a bend, the car left the road, turned over and crashed into a tree. The car was a complete wreck. Dennis was dead. He was 36 years old. He was buried at Hampstead Cemetery in London.

Whenever Dennis played his horn is sounded easy and effortless. It had an extraordinary lyrical beauty and was always incredibly musical. He was a very sensitive player who listened very carefully to the other players and blended in with them. At first he played a French instrument, a Raoux piston-valve horn, similar to that used by his father. This type of instrument has a lovely smooth tone, but was less powerful than the German-made instruments which had become popular since the 1920s. In 1951 he changed to single B instrument made by Alexander, which was not quite as wide as the usual German instruments, still keeping the lighter sound of French horns.

Dennis had made the horn very popular as an instrument, not just through his concerts and recordings but also through the radio. He played difficult music that other horn players could not play. His Mozart recordings inspired Flanders and Swann's "Ill Wind" and his classical playing. His sudden death added to the musical legend.

Aubrey Brain

Aubrey Brain (born London 12 July 1893; died London 21 September 1955) was a British French horn player. There were a lot of French horn players in his family. His father, Alfred Edwin Brain senior, played in Henry Wood’s orchestra at the very first prom in 1895. Later he played for the London Symphony Orchestra. His brother, also called Alfred Edwin Brain, was principal horn player in Henry Wood’s Queen’s Hall Orchetra, but then he emigrated to the USA where he eventually played for the Los Angeles Philharmonic. His son Dennis Brain was to become the most famous French horn player of all.

Aubrey Brain was born in London in 1893. He started to learn the horn from his father. In 1911 he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. He soon became one of Britain’s best horn players. The other great players of the French horn were his father, his elder brother and Adolf Borsdorf. He became principal horn player of the Beecham Opera Company. There he met Marion Beeley, a mezzo-soprano. They married in the summer of 1914 just before the World War I. When war broke out he joined the Welsh Guards and played horn in the band. After the war it was difficult for him at first to find a really good job as horn player . The best horn jobs were already taken by his brother Alfred. Aubrey and Marion had two sons: Leonard (born 1915) and Dennis (born 1921). However, in 1922 Alfred emigrated to the United States. Aubrey soon became first horn of the Royal Philharmonic Society (his father played second horn), and first horn of the Queen’s Hall Orchestra. He was also first horn in the New Symphony and soon he joined the orchestra of Covent Garden as principal horn. In 1923 he joined the London Symphony Orchestra.

In 1923 Borsdorf retired as professor of horn at the Royal Academy of Music, and Aubrey took his place. One of his first pupils was his younger brother Arthur. Although very talented Arthur decided not to take up horn playing professionally and joined the police. Later, Aubrey’s son Dennis was one of his students.

Aubrey had a very successful career, not only as principal horn player in several orchestras, but also as a soloist. He played Mozart’s Second Horn Concerto in 1923 at The Proms. His playing can be heard on several of the very early recordings when the LSO recorded for HMV. Several works were written for him, including the Concerto for French horn, Violin and orchestra by Dame Ethel Smythe. He played it very well, including the chords in the last movement (it is possible to play chords on the horn by humming one note and playing another note of the harmonic series). He played it at the Proms. The conductor Bruno Walter invited him to play it in Berlin. This made Aubrey the first British horn player to play a solo concerto abroad.

When the BBC Symphony Orchestra was started in 1930 Aubrey was their principal horn player. He was still principal horn player with the other big London orchestras (this would be impossible nowadays), but gradually his gave up these positions as the BBC Symphony Orchestra got more and more work and needed their players to be full time.
Aubrey played a French-type horn (a “Raoux horn”) which had a narrow-bore (the tube was very narrow). The German-type horn had a wider bode and made a slightly different sound. Playing on a Raoux horn there was more risk of a note cracking (not speaking properly). The German-type horn was becoming very popular in England, but Aubrey insisted that all the horn players in the BBC Symphony Orchestra continued to play on Raoux horns. Aubrey was a very skilled musician in chamber music and made a recording with the violinist Adolf Busch and the pianist Rudolf Serkin of the Brahms Horn Trio. It sold many copies and continued to sell for many years until the 78rpm records were replaced by long-playing records.

During the war Aubrey started to have health problems. He had a bad fall on Christmas Day 1940. Towards the end of the war he started to get blurred vision, his speech became slurred and he had strange feelings in his fingers and toes. He retired in 1945 after the first rehearsal for the Prom season. He still performed occasionally, usually together with his son Dennis. He died on 20 September 1955, three days after a bad fall which gave him a heart attack.

Aubrey Brain may be remembered less today because of the exceptional fame of his son Dennis. However, he was a very great horn player who helped to improve the standard of horn playing in Britain, both by his teaching and by the example of his performances. The recordings on which he can be heard were all made before the days of the LP. His older son Leonard became a well-known oboist.

Bangor International Airport

Bangor International Airport is a public use passenger airport located 3 miles (5 km) west in the city of Bangor, in Penobscot County, Maine, United States. It is owned and operated by the City of Bangor. It used to be a military base called Dow Air Force Base. The airport has a single runway that is 11,439 ft (3486 m) long and 200 ft (60 m) wide. 

The airport is used a lot because it's near the Great Circle Route, a major air route between Europe and the East Coast of the United States. The 'international' in the airport's name doesn't refer to it being close to Canada (to which it has no regular flights), but its role in travel across the Atlantic Ocean.

Bangor International Airport has passenger service on three airlines, Delta Airlines, Allegiant Air, and US Airways.

Vertebrate brain

The vertebrate brain is the centre of the nervous system. In vertebrates the brain is located in the head, protected by the skull and close to the primary sensory apparatus of vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell.

Brains can be extremely complex. The brain controls the other organs of the body, either by activating muscles or by causing secretion of chemicals such as hormones and neurotransmitters. This control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment.

In vertebrates, the spinal cord by itself can cause reflex responses as well as simple movement such as swimming or walking. However, sophisticated control of behaviour requires a centralized brain.

The structure of all vertebrate brains is basically the same. At the same time, during the course of evolution, the vertebrate brain has undergone many changes, and become more effective. In so-called 'lower' animals, most or all of the brain structure is inherited, and therefore so is their behaviour. In mammals, and especially in man, the brain is developed further during life by learning. This has the benefit of helping them fit better into their environment. The capacity to learn is seen best in the cerebral cortex.



Several brain areas have kept their identities across the whole range of vertebrates, from hagfishes to humans. Here is a list of some of the most important areas, with a brief description of their functions as currently understood. These functions may still be disputed to some degree:










The relationship between brain size, body size and other variables has been studied in a wide range of vertebrate species. Brain size increases with body size but not proportionally. 

Averaging across all mammals, it follows a power law, with an exponent of about 0.75. This formula applies to the average brain of mammals but each family departs from it, reflecting their sophistication of behavior. For example, primates have brains 5 to 10 times as large as the formula predicts. Predators tend to have larger brains. When the mammalian brain increases in size, not all parts increase at the same rate. The larger the brain of a species, the greater the fraction taken up by the neocortex.

Mary: A Fiction

Mary: A Fiction is a novel written by Mary Wollstonecraft, a British feminist. It is her first and only complete novel. Wollstonecraft wrote it when she was a governess in Ireland. The novel was published in 1788 shortly after she decided to embark on a writing career, an unpopular profession for women in 18th-century Britain.

It tells the story of a heroine's "romantic friendships" with a woman and a man. 

Wollstonecraft was inspired by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's idea that "geniuses are self-taught", so Wollstonecraft made Mary, the main character, a self-taught heroine. Wollstonecraft describes Mary as independent and capable of defining femininity and marriage for herself. It is Mary's "strong, original opinions" and her resistance to "conventional wisdom" that makes her a genius. Mary also critiques marriage, 18th-century sensibility and its damaging effects on women.

Cerebral cortex

The cerebral cortex is a most important part of the brain. In humans, it is by far the largest part of the brain.

Though this cannot be seen directly, different parts of the cortex have different functions (see diagram). It plays a key role in memory, attention, perceptual awareness, thought, language, and consciousness. 

It is a sheet of neural tissue that is outermost to the cerebrum of the mammalian brain. It has up to six layers of nerve cells. The human cerebral cortex is 2–4 mm (0.08–0.16 inches) thick.

In preserved brains, it has a grey colour, hence the name 'grey matter'. In contrast to gray matter that is formed from neurons and their unmyelinated fibers, the white matter below them is formed predominantly by myelinated axons interconnecting neurons in different regions of the cerebral cortex with each other and neurons in other parts of the central nervous system.

The surface of the cerebral cortex is folded in large mammals, such that more than two-thirds of it in the human brain is buried in the grooves.

The phylogenetically most recent part of the cerebral cortex, the neocortex, has six horizontal layers; the more ancient part of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, has at most three cellular layers. Neurons in various layers connect vertically to form small microcircuits, called 'columns'.

The neocortex is the newest part of the cerebral cortex to evolve; the other parts of the cerebral cortex are the old cortex, mostly the hippocampus. The cellular organization of the old cortex is different from the six-layer structure mentioned above. In humans, 90% of the cerebral cortex is neocortex.

The six-layer neocortex is a distinguishing feature of mammals; it has been found in the brains of all mammals, but not in any other animals.

Jīn Xuěfēi (simplified Chinese: 金雪飞; traditional Chinese: 金雪飛; born February 15, 1956) is a living Chinese-American writer. He uses the pen name Ha Jin (哈金). "Ha" comes from his favorite city, Harbin. In 1984, he went to America and began to write about China only in English. His work increased international attention to Chinese culture and history.

Ha Jin was born in Liaoning, China. His father was a military officer. Jin joined the People's Liberation Army during the Cultural Revolution when he was 13 years old. He began to teach himself about Chinese literature and to learn the high school curriculum at sixteen. He left the army when he was nineteen, as he entered Heilongjiang University. He got his B. A. degree in English studies there. Next, he earned a M.A. degree in Anglo-American literature at Shandong University.

Jin grew up in the chaos of early communist China. He was at Brandeis University when the 1989 Tiananmen incident happened. The way the Chinese government stopped the protest by force was important to Jin. It helped him decide to emigrate to the United States. It also made him choose to write in English "to preserve the integrity of his work." He eventually earned a Ph.D..

Jin sets many of his stories and novels in China in an imaginary place called Muji City. He has won the National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award for his novel, "Waiting" (1999). He has received three Pushcart Prizes for fiction and a Kenyon Review Prize. Many of his short stories have appeared in "The Best American Short Stories" anthologies. His collection "Under The Red Flag" (1997) won the Flannery O'Connor Award for Short Fiction. "Ocean of Words" (1996) has been awarded the PEN/Hemingway Award. The novel "War Trash" (2004), set during the Korean War, won the PEN/Faulkner Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. 

Jin teaches at Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts. He used to teach at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.

Jin was at the American Academy in Berlin, Germany, in the fall of 2008. He was a Mary Ellen von der Heyden Fellow for Fiction.

Raymond Carver

Raymond Clevie Carver, Jr. (May 25, 1938 – August 2, 1988) was an American short story writer and poet. Carver is considered a major American writer of the late 20th century. He was also helped improve short story writing in the 1980s.

Carver was born in Clatskanie, Oregon, a mill town on the Columbia River, and grew up in Yakima, Washington. His father was a skilled sawmill worker from Arkansas. He was a fisherman and a heavy drinker. Carver's mother sometimes worked as a waitress and as a clerk in a shop. He had one brother, James Franklin Carver, was born in 1943.

Carver studied at local schools in Yakima, Washington. In his spare time he read mostly novels by Mickey Spillane or publications such as Sports Afield and Outdoor Life and hunted and fished with friends and family. After graduating from Yakima High School in 1956, Carver worked with his father at a sawmill in California. In June 1957, aged 19, he married 16-year-old Maryann Burk. She had just graduated from a private Episcopal school for girls. Their daughter, Christine La Rae, was born in December 1957. When their second child, a boy named Vance Lindsay, was born the next year, Carver was 20. Carver supported his family by working as a janitor, sawmill laborer, delivery man, and library assistant. During their marriage, Maryann worked as a waitress, salesperson, administrative assistant, and high school English teacher. 

Carver became interested in writing in California. He had moved there with his family because his mother-in-law had a home in Paradise. Carver attended a creative-writing course taught by the novelist John Gardner. Gardner became his mentor and had a major influence on Carver's life and career. Carver continued his studies first at Chico State University and then at Humboldt State College in Arcata, California, where he studied with Richard Cortez Day. Carver received his B.A. in 1963. During this period he was first published and served as editor for the university literary magazine called Toyon. Carver included some of his own writing under pen names. He later attended the Iowa Writers' Workshop, at the University of Iowa, for one year. Maryann graduated from San Jose State College in 1970 and taught English at Los Altos High School until 1977.

In the mid-1960s Carver and his family lived in Sacramento. He worked as a night custodian at Mercy Hospital. He sat in on classes at what was then Sacramento State College including workshops with poet Dennis Schmitz. Carver and Schmitz soon became friends, and Carver's first book of poems, "Near Klamath", was later written and published with helpful advice from Schmitz. 

With his appearance in the respected "Foley collection," the impending publication of "Near Klamath" by the English Club of Sacramento State College, and the death of his father, 1967 was a landmark year for Carver. That was also the year that he moved his family to Palo Alto, California, so that he could take a job as a textbook editor for Science Research Associates. He worked there until he was fired in 1970 for his inappropriate writing style. In the 1970s and 1980s as his writing career began to take off, Carver taught for several years at universities throughout the United States. 

During his years of working different jobs, rearing children, and trying to write, Carver started to drink heavily. He said that he eventually more or less gave up writing and started drinking all of the time. In the fall semester of 1973, Carver was a teacher in the Iowa Writers' Workshop with John Cheever, but Carver said that they did less teaching than drinking and almost no writing. The next year, after leaving Iowa City, Cheever went to a treatment center to try to overcome his alcoholism, but Carver continued drinking for three years. After going in the hospital three times (between June 1976 and February or March 1977), Carver began his 'second life' and stopped drinking on June 2, 1977, with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous. 

Carver met the poet Tess Gallagher at a writers' conference in Dallas, Texas in November, 1977. Beginning in January, 1979, Carver and Gallagher lived together in El Paso, Texas, in a borrowed cabin near Port Angeles, in western Washington state, and in Tucson, Arizona. In 1980, they moved to Syracuse. Gallagher was the coordinator of the creative writing program at Syracuse University. Carver was a professor in the English department. He and Gallagher bought a house in Syracuse, at 832 Maryland Avenue. Later, the house became so popular that the couple had to hang a sign outside that read "Writers At Work" so that people would leave them alone. In 1982, Carver and first wife, Maryann, were divorced. He married Gallagher in 1988 in Reno, Nevada. Six weeks later, on August 2, 1988, Carver died in Port Angeles, Washington, from lung cancer at the age of 50. In the same year, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters. 

Raymond Carver is buried at Ocean View Cemetery in Port Angeles, WA. The words on his grave are:

"LATE FRAGMENT"

"And did you get what

you wanted from this life, even so?"

"I did."

"And what did you want?"

"To call myself beloved, to feel myself

beloved on the earth."

Carver's career was dedicated to short stories and poetry. He often wrote about blue-collar experiences. These were similar to his own life. In the same way, he often included themes of alcoholism and recovery from his life. 

His first published story appeared in 1960, titled "The Furious Seasons." His first collection, "Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?", was published in 1976. The story with the same name had already appeared in the collection, "Best American Short Stories 1967".

Tess Gallagher published five Carver stories after he died in a book called "Call If You Need Me". One of the stories, "Kindling", won an O. Henry Award in 1999. Throughout his lifetime Carver won six O. Henry Awards: the winning stories were: "Are These Actual Miles" (originally titled "What is it?") (1972), "Put Yourself in My Shoes" (1974), "Are You A Doctor?" (1975), "A Small, Good Thing" (1983), and "Errand" (1988). 

Carver believed he would have died of alcoholism at the age of 40 if he hadn't found a way to stop drinking. When he knew the cancer would kill him, he wrote a poem about that bonus of 10 years, called "Gravy."

<doc id="272368" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=272368" title="Roman consul">
Roman consul

A Roman consul was the highest elected political office of the Roman Republic.

Each year, two consuls were elected together, to serve for a one-year term. Each consul was given veto power over his colleague and the officials would alternate each month.

The consuls were usually patricians, though after 367 BC plebs (common people; plebeians) could stand for election as consul.

Consuls had extensive power in peacetime (administrative, legislative and judicial), and in wartime often held the highest military command. They conducted some religious rites which could only be done by the highest state officials. Consuls also read auguries, an essential step before leading armies into the field.

The consuls could convene the Senate, and presided over its meetings. Each consul served as president of the Senate for a month. They could also summon any of the Roman assemblies and preside over them. Thus, the consuls conducted the elections and put legislative measures to the vote. When neither consul was within the city, their civic duties were assumed by the "praetor urbanus" (city prefect).

Each consul was accompanied in every public appearance by twelve "lictors", who displayed the magnificence of the office and served as his bodyguards. Each lictor held a "fasces", a bundle of rods that contained an axe. The rods symbolized the power of scourging, and the axe the power of capital punishment. When inside the city, the lictors removed the axes from the fasces to show that a citizen could not be executed without a trial. Upon entering the democratic assembly, the lictors would lower the fasces to show that the powers of the consuls derive from the people (populus romanus).

Outside the walls of Rome, the powers of the consuls were far greater in their role as commanders-in-chief of all Roman legions. It was in this function that the consuls were vested with full imperium (power). 

When legions were ordered by a decree of the Senate, the consuls conducted the conscription. Upon entering the army, all soldiers had to take their oath of allegiance to the consuls. The consuls also oversaw the gathering of troops provided by Rome’s allies. 

Within the city a consul could punish and arrest a citizen, but had no power to inflict capital punishment. When on campaign, however, a consul could inflict any punishment he saw fit on any soldier, officer, citizen or ally.

Each consul commanded an army, usually two legions strong, with the help of military tribunes and a quaestor who had financial duties. In the rare case that both consuls marched together, each one held the command for a day in turn. A typical consular army was about 20,000 men strong and consisted of two citizen and two allied legions. In the early years of the republic, Rome's enemies were in central Italy, so campaigns lasted a few months. 

As Rome's frontiers expanded, in the 2nd century BC, the campaigns became lengthier. Rome was a warlike society, and very seldom did not wage war. So the consul upon entering office was expected by the Senate and the people to march his army against Rome's enemies, and expand the Roman frontiers. His soldiers expected to return to their homes after the campaign with spoils. If the consul won an overwhelming victory, he was hailed as imperator by his troops, and could request to be granted a triumph. 

The consul could conduct the campaign as he saw fit, and had unlimited powers. However, after the campaign, he could be prosecuted for his misdeeds. 

In the Roman Empire, the consuls were merely a figurative representative of Rome’s republican heritage. The consulate then held much less power and authority, since the emperor was the supreme leader. However, consuls were often high-ranking and important in their own right. Some were designated successors of their emperor. Also, emperors frequently appointed themselves as consuls.

The office survived (much altered) until the early 9th century AD.

O. Henry Award

The O. Henry Award is given for especially good short stories. The prize is given each year. The award is named after the American short story author, O. Henry.

The PEN/O. Henry Prize Stories is a book that is published each year with that year's twenty best stories from magazines in U.S. and Canadian, written in English.

The award itself is called The O. Henry "Award", not the O. Henry "Prize", though until recently there were first, second and third prize winners.

The award was first given in 1919. Money to support the award comes from the Society of Arts and Sciences. As of 2003, the series editor chooses twenty short stories and each one is called an O. Henry Prize Story. All stories originally written in English and published in an American or Canadian magazine can possibly win. Three people become jurors each year. The jurors get the twenty prize stories in text form. The author or publication name are not listed. Each juror works alone and chooses one special short story and comments on it.

The goal of The O. Henry Prize Stories is to improve the art of the short story. Starting in 2003, "The O. Henry Prize Stories" is dedicated to a writer who has made a major contribution to the art of the short story. The O. Henry Prize Stories 2007 was dedicated to Sherwood Anderson, a U.S. short-story writer. Jurors for 2007 were Charles D'Ambrosio, Lily Tuck, and Ursula K. Le Guin.

Laura Furman is now the series editor for "The O. Henry Prize Stories".

In 2009 Anchor books announced a change in the series tittle. Anchor is the publisher of The O. Henry Prize Stories. They worked with with the PEN American Center and renamed the series the PEN/O. Henry Prize Stories collection. Profits from selling The PEN/O. Henry Prize Stories 2009 books went to PEN's Readers & Writers Program. This program sends well-known authors to under served inner-city schools. 

The selection included stories by Graham Joyce, Kristen Sundberg Lunstrum, E. V. Slate, John Burnside, Mohan Sikka, L. E. Miller, Alistair Morgan, Roger Nash, Manuel Muñoz, Caitlin Horrocks, Ha Jin, Paul Theroux, Judy Troy, Nadine Gordimer, Viet Dinh, Karen Brown (author), Marisa Silver, Paul Yoon, Andrew Sean Greer and Junot Díaz, with A. S. Byatt, Tim O'Brien and Anthony Doerr – all authors of past O. Henry Prize Stories – serving as the prize jury.

In an interview for the Vintage Books and Anchor Books blog, editor Laura Furman called working with PEN a "natural partnership."

Power line

Power lines are poles that conduct electricity through to other facilities. Some have step-up transformers and step-down transformers. The voltage of the power at the end is usually 120V, but is much higher while going through the lines. The power at the end is then safe enough to be used when "stepped-down" by a transformer.

The original power is made at a power plant. As the power is sent through the power lines, sometimes it encounters spots that it cannot go through. Then it will need to raise its voltage with a step-up transformer. The act is called "stepping up". But when it reaches buildings, it is too dangerous to be used (about 750,000V) so it goes through a step-down transformer. The act is called "stepping down". Then the elctricity can be distributed to buildings.

Greco-Persian Wars

The Greco-Persian wars were a series of wars fought between Ancient Greece and Persia's Achaemenid Empire in the 5th century BC. The struggle lasted 50 years, from 499–449. Fifty years before the war started, Cyrus the Great had conquered the Greek colonies on the western coast of Asia Minor, an area the Greeks called Ionia. The Persians put a tyrant in charge of each city.

The Ionian cities revolted under a former tyrant, Aristagoras. He got support from Athens and Eretria, and together they burnt the Persian regional capital city, Sardis. The Persian king, now Darius the Great, vowed revenge.


Although 449 BC saw the end of the wars started by the Ionian revolt, the two civilisations continued for more than a hundred years. The wars between Athens and Sparta allowed Persia to take back all she had lost in the Greco-Persian wars, until finally Alexander the Great put an end to the Achaemenid Empire. This is a brief summary of these later conflicts:

<doc id="272428" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=272428" title="Caro-Kann defence">
Caro-Kann defence

The Caro-Kann defence is a chess opening. It is a common defence for Black when White opens by moving his King's pawn two squares on the first move. It begins: 
Usually, the next moves are:
followed by 3. (the Modern Variation), 3. (the Classical Variation), 3. (the Exchange Variation), or 3. (the Advance Variation). The modern variation (3.Nc3) is most popular. 

The Caro-Kann, like the Sicilian defence and French defence, is an asymmetrical defence to 1.e4. These are sometimes called 'semi-open games'. The Caro is thought to be more solid and less dynamic than the others, which means that play is likely to be more quiet and positional. It may lead to good endgames for Black, who has the better pawn structure.

The opening is named after the English player Horatio Caro and the Austrian Marcus Kann, who studied the opening in 1886.

The most common way of handling the Caro-Kann, the Classical variation (often called the Capablanca variation) happens after the moves 
For a long time, this was thought to be the best play for both sides in the Caro-Kann. White usually continues
Although White's pawn on h5 looks ready to attack, it can prove to be a weakness in an endgame.

This variation is a big reason that people think the Caro-Kann is solid defence. Black makes very few compromises in his pawn structure, and plays c5 in time to fight for the d4 square. Black can castle queenside, castle kingside, or even leave his king in the centre. Should the game go to an endgame, Black often has good chances because of his solid pawn structure and kingside pawn majority.

Another solid positional line is the Modern variation. It happens after the moves 
Played by the first world champion Wilhelm Steinitz, today the variation is called either the Smyslov variation or, most often, the Modern variation. 

The short-term goal of 4...Nd7 is to make developing his pieces easier by trading a pair of knights without damaging his pawn structure by the direct 4...Nf6. Play is similar to the Classical variation except that Black is not forced to play his QB to the g6 square. However, this freedom comes at a cost as White is able to take up space in the center. White often plays the aggressive 5.Ng5!? pressuring key points such as the f7-square.

This variation can lead to a quick mating trap with 5.Qe2 Ngf6?? 6.Nd6#.

Two variations begin with:

The Bronstein-Larsen Variation is after:
Black has chosen a worse pawn structure, and often castles queenside. Black does have compensation with of the open g-file for the rook and unusually active play for the Caro-Kann. It is generally considered somewhat double-edged.

The Korchnoi Variation arises after:
Viktor Korchnoi has played 5...exf6 many times (including his first world championship match with Anatoly Karpov), and this line has also been employed by Ulf Andersson. Black's 5...exf6 is thought to be sounder than 5...gxf6!? of the previous and offers Black fast development, though also giving White the superior pawn structure and long-term prospects.

The 3...Bf5 variation that follows with
has become popular after having previously been thought as poor for many years. The Advance variation has since been brought back to life by aggressive lines such as the Bayonet Attack (4.Nc3 e6 5.g4), a popular line in the 1980s and later favoured by Latvian Grandmaster Alexei Shirov, or 4.Nf3 e6 5.Be2 c5 6.Be3, popularised by English Grandmaster Nigel Short and often seen in the 1990s.

The 3...c5 variation that follows with
is an important alternative and avoids the opening theory with 3...Bf5. It was used by Botvinnik in his 1961 match with Tal. 

In comparison to the French defense, Black lacks the tempo normally spent on ...e6. However, White can only take advantage of this by weakening his own central bind with 4. dxc5 when Black has good chances of regaining the pawn.

The Exchange Variation is
1.e4 c6
2.d4 d5
3.exd5 cxd5.
The Panov-Botvinnik Attack begins with the move
4.c4.

This system often leads to typical isolated queen's pawn (IQP) positions, with White gaining rapid development, a grip on e5, and kingside attacking chances to make up for the long-term structural weakness of the isolated d4 pawn. The major variation in this line 4...Nf6 5.Nc3 e6 6.Nf3, when Black's main alternatives are 6...Bb4 (a position which often transposes into lines of the Nimzo-Indian defence) and 6...Be7, once the most common line. 6...Nc6?! is inferior as it is favourably met by 7.c5!, after which White plans on seizing the e5-square through the advance of his b-pawn to b5 or by exchanging the Black's Knight on c6 after Bb5.

The "true" Exchange Variation begins with
4.Bd3 Nc6
5.c3 Nf6
6.Bf4 Bg4
7.Qb3
This line is thought to have equal chances for both sides, and was tried by Bobby Fischer. Some of the strategic ideas are analogous to the Queen's Gambit declined, Exchange variation, (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.cxd5 exd5) with colours reversed.

White can play 2.c4. Then Black may play 2...d5 (see ). This can transpose to the Panov-Botvinnik (B14, given above, with exd5 cxd5 d4) or Caro-Kann (B10, with the double capture on d5). Or Black may play 2...e5 (see ).

Also White can play 2.Nc3. Then Black may play 2...d5 (see ). This can lead to the Steinitz Variation (B17, given above), Caro-Kann (B15), Two Knights, 3...Bg4 (B11), or Caro-Kann (B10). Or Black may play 2...g6 (see ).

Two Knights Variation: 1.e4 c6 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3, played by Bobby Fischer in his youth, where White gets rapid development and has options with the d-pawn. Black's logical and probably best reply is 3...Bg4. After 4.h3 Bxf3 5.Qxf3, the positional continuation, Black has the option of 5...Nf6 or 5...e6. This variation sets a trap: if Black plays along the lines of the Classical Variation, he gets in trouble after 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 (4...Nd7 is playable) 5.Ng3 Bg6?! (5...Bg4) 6.h4 h6 7.Ne5 Bh7 (7...Qd6 may be best) 8.Qh5! g6 (forced) 9.Bc4! e6 (9...gxh5?? 10.Bxf7#) 10.Qe2 with a huge advantage for White. Now 10...Qe7! is best. Instead, Lasker-Radsheer, 1908 and Alekhine-Bruce, 1938 ended quickly after, respectively, 10...Bg7?? 11.Nxf7! and 10...Nf6?? 11.Nxf7! 4...Bh5 is a complicated line, in which White can trap the bishop, though Black has much compensation.

The Caro-Kann can sometimes be reached through the English Opening: 1.c4 c6 2.e4 d5.

The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings has ten codes for the Caro-Kann Defence, B10 to B19.

They see the transition in the Near East and Eastern Mediterranean from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, as violent, sudden and culturally disruptive. 

The palace economies of the Aegean and Anatolia of the Late Bronze Age were replaced, eventually, by the village cultures of the Ancient Dark Age.

Between 1200 and 1150 BC, the cultural collapse of the Mycenaean kingdoms, the Hittite Empire in Anatolia and Syria, and the Egyptian Empire in Syria and Canaan, interrupted trade routes and extinguished literacy. 

In the first phase of this period, almost every city between Troy and Gaza was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied: examples include Hattusa, Mycenae, Ugarit.

The gradual end of the Dark Age saw the rise of settled Neo-Hittite Aramaean kingdoms of the mid-10th century BCE, and the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

Every important Anatolian site during the preceding Late Bronze Age shows a destruction layer. It appears that civilization did not recover to the same level as that of the Hittites for another thousand years. Hattusa, the Hittite capital, was burned and abandoned, and never reoccupied. Troy was destroyed at least twice, before being abandoned until Roman times.

The sacking and burning of the sites of Enkomi, Kition, and Sinda may have happened twice, before they were abandoned. Originally, two waves of destruction, ca. 1230 BC by the Sea Peoples and ca. 1190 BC by Aegean refugees have been proposed. 

Syrian sites previously showed evidence of trade links with Egypt and the Aegean in the Late Bronze Age. Evidence at Ugarit shows that the destruction there occurred after the reign of Merenptah. 

The last Bronze Age king of Ugarit, Ammurapi, was a contemporary of the Hittite king Suppiluliuma II. The exact dates of his reign are unknown. A letter by the king is preserved on one of the clay tablets found baked in the conflagration of the destruction of the city. Ammurapi stresses the seriousness of the crisis faced by many Near Eastern states from invasion by the advancing Sea Peoples in a dramatic response to a plea for assistance from the king of Alasiya (Cyprus):

My father, behold, the enemy's ships came (here); my cities(?) were burned, and they did evil things in my country. Does not my father know that all my troops and chariots(?) are in the Land of Hatti, and all my ships are in the Land of Lukka?...Thus, the country is abandoned to itself. May my father know it: the seven ships of the enemy that came here inflicted much damage upon us.

Unfortunately for Ugarit, no help arrived and Ugarit was burned to the ground at the end of the Bronze Age. A cuneiform tablet found in 1986 shows that Ugarit was destroyed after the death of Merneptah, about 1178 BC. 

All centres along a coastal route from Gaza northward were destroyed, and not reoccupied for up to thirty years. 

None of the Mycenaean palaces of the Late Bronze Age survived, with destruction being heaviest at palaces and fortified sites. Up to 90% of small sites in the Peloponnese were abandoned, suggesting a major depopulation. The End Bronze Age collapse marked the start of what has been called the Greek Dark Ages, which lasted for more than 400 years. Other cities, like Athens, continued to be occupied, but with a more local sphere of influence, limited evidence of trade and an impoverished culture, from which it took centuries to recover.

Several cities were destroyed, Assyria lost northwestern cities which were reconquered by Tiglath-Pileser I after his ascension to kingship. Control of the Babylonian and Assyrian regions extended barely beyond the city limits. Babylon was sacked by the Elamites.

After apparently surviving for a while, the Egyptian Empire collapsed in the mid twelfth century BCE (during the reign of Ramesses VI). This led to the Third Intermediate Period, that is, non-dynasty. 

Robert Drews describes the collapse as "the worst disaster in ancient history, even more calamitous than the collapse of the Western Roman Empire". A number of people have spoken of the cultural memories of the disaster as stories of a "lost golden age". Hesiod for example spoke of Ages of Gold, Silver and Bronze, separated from the modern harsh cruel world of the Age of Iron by the Age of Heroes.

It was a period associated with the collapse of central authority, a depopulation, particularly of urban areas, the loss of literacy in Anatolia and the Aegean, and its restriction elsewhere, the disappearance of established patterns of long-distance international trade, and increasingly vicious struggles for power.

There are various theories put forward to explain the situation of collapse, many of them compatible with each other.

The Hekla 3 eruption was about this time, and is dated at 1159 BC by Egyptologists and British archeologists.

Earthquakes tend to occur in sequences or 'storms', where a major earthquake above 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale can set off later earthquakes along the weakened fault line. When a map of earthquake occurrence is superimposed on a map of the sites destroyed in the Late Bronze Age, there is a very close correspondence.

Evidence includes the widespread findings of "Naue II-type swords" (coming from South-Eastern Europe) throughout the region, and Egyptian records of invading "northerners from all the lands". 
The Ugarit correspondence at the time mentions invasions by tribes of such as the mysterious Sea Peoples. Equally, the last Linear B documents in the Aegean (dating to just before the collapse) reported a large rise in piracy, slave raiding and other attacks, particularly around Anatolia. Later fortresses along the Libyan coast, constructed and maintained by the Egyptians after the reign of Ramesses II, were built to reduce raiding.

This theory is strengthened by the fact that the collapse coincides with the appearance in the region of many new ethnic groups. Indo-European tribes such as the Phrygians, Thracians, Macedonians and Dorian Greeks seem to have arrived at this time – possibly from the north. There also seems to have been widespread migration of the Aramaeans – possibly from the South-East.

Ultimate reasons for these migrations could include drought, developments in warfare/weaponry, earthquakes or other natural disasters. This means that the migrations theory is not incompatible with the other theories mentioned here.

The Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region, beginning with precocious iron-working in what is now Bulgaria and Romania in the 13th and 12th centuries BCE.
Leonard R. Palmer suggested that iron, whilst inferior to bronze weapons, was in more plentiful supply and so allowed larger armies of iron users to overwhelm the smaller armies of bronze-using chariotry. 

It now seems that the disruption of long distance trade cut easy supplies of tin, making bronze impossible to make. Older implements were recycled and then iron substitutes were used.

Drought could have easily precipitated or hastened socio-economic problems and led to wars. More recently Brian Fagan has shown how the diversion of mid-winter storms, from the Atlantic to north of the Pyrenees and the Alps, bringing wetter conditions to Central Europe but drought to the Eastern Mediterranean, was associated with the Late Bronze Age collapse.

Robert Drews argues that massed infantry used newly developed weapons and armor. Cast rather than forged spearheads and long swords, a revolutionizing cut-and-thrust weapon, and javelins were used. The appearance of bronze foundries suggest "that mass production of bronze artifacts was suddenly important in the Aegean". For example, Homer uses "spears" as a virtual synonym for "warrior", suggesting the continued importance of the spear in combat. 

Such new weaponry, used by a proto-hoplite model of infantry able to withstand attacks of massed chariotry, would destabilize states that were based upon the use of chariots by the ruling class. This precipitated an abrupt social collapse as raiders and/or infantry mercenaries began to conquer, loot, and burn the cities.

A general systems collapse has been put forward as an explanation for the reversals in culture that occurred between the Urnfield culture of the 12-13th centuries BCE and the rise of the Celtic Hallstatt culture in the 9th and 10th centuries. This theory may, however, simply raise the question of whether this collapse was the cause of, or the effect of, the Bronze Age collapse being discussed. 

In the Middle East, a variety of factors — including population growth, soil degradation, drought, cast bronze weapon and iron production technologies — could have combined to push the relative price of weaponry (compared to arable land) to a level unsustainable for traditional warrior aristocracies. In complex societies which were increasingly fragile, this combination of factors may have contributed to the collapse. 

The critical flaws of the Late Bronze Age are its centralization, specialization, complexity and top-heavy political structure. These flaws then revealed themselves through revolts, defections, demographic crises (overpopulation), and wars between states. Other factors which could have placed increasing pressure on the fragile kingdoms include the ‘Sea Peoples’ piratical disturbances of maritime trade, drought, crop failures, famine, Dorian migration or invasion.

Adolf Borsdorf

Adolph Borsdorf (born Dittmansdorf, Saxony, 25 December 1854; died London, 15 April 1923), was a German player of the French horn.

Borsdorf was born in Saxony in 1854. He studied the French horn at the Conservatoire in Dresden and played in a military band. In 1879 he moved to England where he stayed for the rest of his life, becoming the most important horn player in England. The conductor Hans Richter offered him at job in the orchestra at Covent Garden. In 1904 he joined the newly-formed London Symphony Orchestra. The four horn players in that orchestra were excellent players and were often called “God’s Own Quartet”.

Borsdorf and his colleague Franz Paersch had learned to play on horns that were made in Germany. These had a wide bore (the hole through the tube). However, both players changed to playing instruments made in France by a horn-maker called Raoux. These instruments had a narrower bore. They were not quite as powerful but gave a particularly clear sound.

Borsdorf became professor at the Royal College of Music when it was founded in 1882. He also taught at the Royal Academy of Music. He soon became the best horn player in London. He was playing principal horn in the orchestra which Henry Wood conducted at the very first Promenade Concert in the Queen’s Hall in 1895 (the fourth horn was A.E.Brain, grandfather of Dennis Brain). He was also in the orchestra when Richard Strauss’s "Till Eulenspiegel" was given its first performance in England in 1896 with the composer conducting.

In 1913 he became ill and had to have teeth removed. There was also another problem for him: World War I broke out in 1914 and there was a lot of anti-German feeling in England. After the war he rarely played in public.

Borsdorf died in 1923. He had done more than anyone else to improve the standard of horn playing in England. He taught many talented pupils, including A.E.Brain Jr., Aubrey Brain, Frank Probyn and his own three sons: Oskar, Francis and Emil who all became professional horn players.

Alfred Edwin Brain Sr.

Alfred Edwin Brain (born Turnham Green, London, 4 February 1860; died London, 25 October 1929), was an English player of the French horn. He was the founder of a great school of English horn playing. His grandson Dennis Brain was to become perhaps the most famous horn player of all time. He is known as A.E.Brain Sr. (Senior) because one of his sons, who also became a famous horn player, had the same name.

A.E.Brain was born in 1860. His father had fought in the Crimean War and was now an invalid. Alfred did not get much education. When he was 12 he joined the Scots Guards and played the horn in the band. He married in 1880 and had seven children. Two of them were to become great horn players: Alfred and Aubrey. 

He played in several orchestras, including the Philharmonic Society, the Queen’s Hall Orchestra and Covent Garden. He played a lot for Henry Wood in The Proms. In orchestras he nearly always played fourth horn, so his nickname was “George IV”. In 1904 he became a founder member of the London Symphony Orchestra. The four horn players in that orchestra: Adolf Borsdorf, Thomas Busby, Henri Van der Meerschen and A.E.Brain, were often called “God’s Own Quartet” because they blended together so well.

He died in 1929 after a short retirement.

Alfred Edwin Brain Jr.

Alfred Edwin Brain Jr. (born London, 24 October 1885; died Los Angeles, 29 March 1966) was an English player of the French horn. He came from a family which included many famous horn players, including his nephew, Dennis Brain who became perhaps the most famous horn player of all time.

A.E.Brain Jr (Junior, to distinguish him from his father who had the same name) was born in 1885. His father, Alfred Edwin Brain Sr. was a well-known horn player. Alfred started to learn the trumpet when he was six, but when he was twelve he changed to the French horn and learned from his father. He studied at the Royal Academy of Music with Adolf Borsdorf and also learned the piano from G.D.Cunningham who was to teach his nephew the organ some forty years later. His first professional job was with the Scottish Orchestra. He then played in the Queen’s Hall Orchestra and the London Symphony Orchestra. 

When World War I broke out he joined the Scots Guards, but later, in 1917, he did a lot of dangerous work in France where the fighting was taking place. After the war he was awarded the British War Medal and Victory Medal for his bravery.

When he returned after the war he got jobs with several of the London orchestras, including Covent Garden where he played for Sir Thomas Beecham. His brother Aubrey, also an excellent horn player, returned from the war after him. By this time Alfred had got all the best horn jobs in London, so it was difficult for Aubrey to find the best jobs.

In 1923 he emigrated to the United States. He played in the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and later for the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. In his later years he recorded a lot in film studios, including for 20th century Fox.

Skimboarding

Skimboarding is a form of shallow water surfing that has been around since the golden era of surfing. When the waves were poor, surfers would often attempt to surf in shallow breaking water. This led to making of smaller, lighter boards, named skimboards for the way they allow the user to skim across the surface of the water. Lifeguards were quick to adopt these new boards and used skimboarding as a way to quickly move up and down the beach in shallow water. Skimboarding has progressed and is now a recognized sport. Competitions are held annually around the world and produce large amounts of revenue for this corner of the market. These competitions also allow skimboarders to exhibit the amazing maneuvers that technology, evolution and skill have made possible.

Arminius

Arminius, also known as Armin or Hermann (b. 18 BC/17 BC in Magna Germania; d. AD 21 in Germania) was a chieftain of the Cherusci. He was able to unite a group of Germanic tribes together to fight the Romans. They destroyed a Roman army in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. This was the greatest military disaster the Romans had ever suffered.

After the battle, Arminius immediately sent Varus' severed head to Maroboduus, king of the Marcomanni, the other most powerful Germanic ruler. Arminius offered an anti-Roman alliance. Marobod declined the offer, sending the head on to Rome for burial, and remained neutral throughout the ensuing war. Only later did a brief, inconclusive war break out between the two Germanic leaders.

Later, in 14 AD, the Roman general Germanicus, nephew of the Emperor Tiberius, led a huge 8-legion army (a legion was up to 5,000 men) into Germania against the coalition of tribes led by Arminius.

After visiting the site of the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, where 15/20,000 Romans had been killed in 9 AD, and burying their remains, he launched a massive assault on the heartland of Arminius' tribe, the Cheruscans. 

Arminius initially lured Germanicus' cavalry into a trap and inflicted minor casualties, until successful fighting by the Roman infantry caused the Germans to break and flee into the forest. This victory, combined with the fact that winter was fast approaching, meant Germanicus's next step was to lead his army back to its winter quarters on the Rhine.

In spite of doubts on the part of his uncle, Emperor Tiberius, Germanicus managed to raise another huge army and invaded Germany again the next year, in 16. He forced a crossing of the Weser near modern Minden, suffering heavy losses. Then he met Arminius' army in an engagement often called the Battle of the Weser River.

Germanicus's superior tactics and better trained and equipped legions inflicted huge casualties on the German army, with only minor losses. One final battle was fought at the Angivarian Wall west of modern Hanover, repeating the pattern of high German fatalities, forcing them to flee. 

With his main objectives reached and with winter approaching Germanicus ordered his army back to their winter camps, with the fleet occasioning some damage by a storm in the North Sea. Although only a small number of soldiers died it was still a bad ending for a brilliantly fought campaign. After a few more raids across the Rhine, which resulted in the recovery of two of the three legion's eagles lost in 9, Germanicus was recalled to Rome and informed by Tiberius that he would be given a triumph and reassigned to a different command.

Five years later, Arminius was killed on the orders of rival Germanic chiefs. Although Arminius could not keep unity among the Germanic tribes, the loss of Roman legions in the Teutoburg forest had a far-reaching effect on the Germanic tribes and the Roman Empire. Germanicus' campaign was the last major Roman military effort east of the Rhine.

Impairment

Impairment, or being impaired, is the state of losing a part of a function. For example, people who drink too much alcohol could be "impaired" in some or all of their senses like touch or even eyesight. The senses that impair a person might make the person do or say things they would never normally do or say. The level of harm done usually depends on the substance. If it is mild the person usually is not harmed or impaired. Sometimes being impaired is natural, or from a mutated gene.

Mild stimulants like caffeine usually do not harm the person. However, opiates, such as ecstasy or marijuana, can impair all five senses of the person who ingested it. However, impairment can sometimes happen naturally with mutated genes.

Often taking a mild depressant or stimulant does not have much effect on the person who took it. But more serious drugs, substances, or even medications can have a large effect on the person. Usually stimulants keep the person awake and energetic. Depressants work the opposite way; they decrease the heart rate of the person and relax them. Sedatives give the same effect. More of these substances can carry harm or even life-threatening effects, if ingested in large amounts. This is called intoxication if with a toxin.

Doctor of Medicine

Doctor of Medicine (MD, from the Latin Medicinæ Doctor meaning "Teacher of Medicine") is a doctoral degree for physicians (medical doctors). The degree is given by medical schools.

It is a professional doctorate / first professional degree (qualifying degree) in some countries, including the United States and Canada. Students need to have completed 90 to 120 credit hours of university level work (see second entry degree) and in most cases should already have a Bachelors Degree. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Germany, the Doctor of Medicine is an advanced academic "research" degree similar to a PhD or a higher doctorate. In Britain, Ireland, and many Commonwealth nations, the qualifying medical degree is the Bachelor of Science in Medicine, Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS, BMBS, BM BCh, BM, MB BCh BAO, or MBChB) and is the same as the M.D. degree in the U.S. system.

1707 Hōei earthquake

The 1707 Hōei earthquake happened at 14:00 local time on 28 October 1707. It was the largest earthquake in Japanese history.

The southern coast of Honshu runs in the same direction as the Nankai Trough. This marks the place where the Philippine Sea Plate moves under the Eurasian Plate. Movement on this boundary causes many earthquakes; some of them are megathrust earthquakes. The Nankai megathrust has five parts (A-E) that can break one by one. The different parts have broken either one at a time or all together many times over the last 1,300 years. This kind of quake often happens in pairs with a relatively short time between them. In addition to the two earthquakes in 1854, there were similar earthquakes in 1944 and 1946. Each time, the northeastern part broke before the southwestern part. In 1707, the earthquakes were either at the same time, or close enough together so that writing from that time do not describe them separately.

29,000 houses were destroyed and more than 5,000 people were killed. The earthquake caused at least one major landslide in Shizuoka. This landslide was one of the three largest in Japan and is called the Ohya Landslide. It covered an area of 1.8 km with an estimated volume of 120 million m. In the Nara Basin, the earthquake made the soil behave like a liquid.

There were two other very large earthquakes: the 1854 Ansei-Tōkai and Ansei-Nankai earthquakes. The 1707 was stronger than both. Several observations show that the Hōei earthquake was bigger. At Cape Muroto, Kōchi, a cliff was raised up about 2.3 m in 1707, but just 1.5 m in 1854. In the Kawachi Plain area, the earthquake was around 6–7 on the JMA scale. Also, the amount of damage and height of the water from tsunami showed the strength of the earthquake. There are also records of tsunami at distant locations, such as Nagasaki and Jeju-do, South Korea.

The tsunami that followed the earthquake raised water along the coast. Along the southwestern coast of Kōchi, the average increase in sea level was 7.7 m. In some places it rose up to 10 m .

Changes in stress caused by large earthquakes may be enough to cause volcanic eruptions, when the magma system of the volcano is close to a critical state. The great earthquake in 1707 may have changed pressure in the magma under Mount Fuji.

Photo editing

Photo editing is the changing of images. These images can be digital photographs, illustrations, or prints (photographs on film). Some types of editing, such as airbrushing, are done by hand and others are done using photo editing programs like Photoshop and Microsoft Paint. Photo editing is done for many reasons. Many photos of models are edited to remove blemishes and make the model "sexier". This is usually called "retouching", "airbrushing" or "Photoshopping", even if Photoshop is not used to edit the photo. Other reasons to edit a photo include fixing errors (red eye, contrast, brightness, etc.), practical jokes, and tricking people. Photo editing is also used to make completely new images. Photo editing is sometimes called photo manipulation, usually when it is used to trick people.

The first known example of photo editing happened in the 1860s to a photo of President Abraham Lincoln. Before the invention of computers, people had to edit images by hand. Some editing was done by pasting photos together. People also used tools like ink, paint and airbrushes.

In the 1980s, the photo editing computer programs were released. The first version of Adobe Photoshop was released in 1987. Since then, it has become one of the most popular photo editing programs. In fact, it is so popular that many people now use the word "photoshop" to mean photo editing in general.

In Puerto Rico, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, Colombia and in some other Latin American countries, piñatas are traditionally used only at children's birthday parties. They are usually made of cardboard, colorfully decorated to match the birthday party theme and filled with candy, chocolates, small toys and confetti. Colored strings (long enough to reach the ground) are attached to the bottom of the piñata, where a trap-door is hidden under the decoration. The piñata is then hung somewhere where everyone can see, but the strings are kept out of the reach of children. Toward the end of the party, usually after the cutting of the cake, an announcement is made that the piñata will be 'broken' and each child is given an empty party bag. All the children get together directly underneath the piñata and each child is given a string to hold. Then, at the count of three, the children pull their strings all at the same time. This opens the hidden trap-door (or 'breaks' the piñata) and the children receive a shower of candy and confetti while they rush to fill up their bags with the treats.

Hōei eruption of Mount Fuji

The started on December 16, 1707 (23rd day of the 11th month of the year Hōei 4) and ended about January 1, 1708 (9th day of the 12th month of the year Hōei 4) during the Edo period. There was no lava flow, but the Hoei eruption released at least 800 million cubic meters of volcanic ash. This ash spread over very large areas around the volcano. It even reached Edo almost 100 km away. Cinders and ash fell like rain in Izu, Kai, Sagami, and Musashi provinces.

The eruption was on Mount Fuji's east–north-east slope and made three new volcanic openings called No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 Hōei vents. The danger of the eruption increased over the next several days. After the first earthquake and explosion of cinders and ash, another stronger explosion happened a few days later. This explosion threw out rocks and stones. Mount Fuji has not erupted since.

Hokusai's "One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji" includes an image of the small crater which developed from a secondary eruption site on the southwestern slope. This was called Hōeizan (Mount Hōei) because the eruption happened in year Hōei 4.

Today the crater can be visited from Fujinomiya Trail or Gotemba Trail of Mount Fuji.

In the year after the Hōei eruption, another related disaster happened. The Sakawa River flooded. Sand from the volcano fell and widely covered the fields east of Mount Fuji. Farmers made sand piles by dumping the ash and sand from their fields. The rain washed away the sand piles from the dumping grounds and into the rivers again and again. This made some of the rivers shallower, especially the Sakawa. Enough ash had fallen to partly block the river. The ash made temporary dams. Heavy rainfall on August 7 and 8, 1708, caused an avalanche of volcanic ash and mud and broke the dams. The river flooded the Ashigara plain.

Forest of Secrets (Warriors)

Forest of Secrets is the third book in the series "Warriors".

"Forest of Secrets" takes place in the New Forest in England, with just one change: a mountain exists in the book but not in reality.

Fireheart, a ThunderClan warrior, still looks for a way to make Tigerclaw get seen by his true personality. Graystripe, another ThunderClan warrior, is still in love with a RiverClan warrior, Silverstream, and eventually she has kits, but dies in the process. Fireheart and Graystripe find Ravenpaw, a loner who is no longer an apprentice of ThunderClan, and get the true story. Fireheart uses the story to try and frame Tigerclaw, but fails. Eventually, Tigerclaw brings a band of rogues into the camp, and tries to kill Bluestar. Fireheart rescues Bluestar and Tigerclaw gets banished from ThunderClan. Fireheart is deputy in his place and Graystripe takes his kits to RiverClan. Bluestar has gone crazy by that time and Fireheart tries his best to calm her.

Rising Storm (Warriors)

Rising Storm is the fourth book in the original "Warriors" series. 

Fireheart, now second in command to Bluestar, the leader, must deal with Bluestar's new insanity (from when Tigerclaw betrayed ThunderClan) as well as the Clan's needs. He has to take care of his nephew and apprentice Cloudpaw, and make sure he is trained and abides by the Warrior Code. So far Cloudpaw has not done that and gets into trouble, even going so far as to beg for food from a Twoleg, which results in him being stolen. Ravenpaw comes to meet Fireheart to tell him where Cloudpaw is, and so he, Fireheart, and Sandstorm go and rescue Cloudpaw. On the way back the patrol, without Ravenpaw, runs into a WindClan patrol, and get into a fight. They win, so they advance back to their territory and are greeted by the Clan. Later on, Fireheart detects fire and warns the Clan. The Clan rushes to the RiverClan camp for shelter, but Yellowfang dies saving elders. Fireheart then races back to the RiverClan territory and the Clan goes home. Finally, Fireheart takes ThunderClan to the Gathering and discovers that Tigerclaw is now the leader of ShadowClan.

Titanosaur

Titanosaurs (members of the groups Titanosauria and/or Titanosauroidea) were a diverse group of sauropod dinosaurs.

They were some of the heaviest creatures ever to walk the earth. Titanosaurs included "Saltasaurus", "Isisaurus", "Argentinosaurus" and "Paralititan". The largest might have weighed up to 100 tonnes (110 short tons) or, perhaps, even double that, if some poorly-described data are to be believed (see "Bruhathkayosaurus"). 

They were named after the mythological Titans, the early deities of Ancient Greece, who preceded the Twelve Olympians. 

Together with the brachiosaurs and relatives they make up the larger clade Titanosauriformes.

<doc id="272632" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=272632" title="Battle of Thermopylae">
Battle of Thermopylae

The Battle of Thermopylae, 480 , was fought between an alliance of Greek city-states, led by Sparta, and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I. It took place at the pass of Thermopylae. 

The battle was the climax of the second Persian invasion of Greece. It took place over three days, at the same time as the naval Battle of Artemisium.

The Persian invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the first Persian invasion of Greece. This was ended by the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon. Xerxes amassed a huge army and navy, and set out for the second time to conquer all of Greece. 

The Athenian general Themistocles suggested the Greek allies should block the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae, and block the Persian navy at the Straits of Artemisium.

A Greek force of approximately 7,000 men marched north to block the pass in the summer of 480 BC. The huge Persian army arrived at the pass in late August or early September.

Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held off the Persians for seven days in total (including three of battle), before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous last stands. 

During two full days of battle, the small force led by King Leonidas I of Sparta blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass. After the second day of battle, a local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks by revealing a small path that led behind the Greek lines. Aware that his force was being outflanked, Leonidas dismissed the bulk of the Greek army, and remained to guard the rear with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians (who refused to leave), 400 Thebans and perhaps a few hundred others. Most of them were killed.

The pass at Thermopylae was thus opened to the Persian army according to Herodotus, at the cost to the Persians of up to 20,000 fatalities. The Greek rearguard meanwhile, was annihilated, with a probable loss of 2,000 men, including those killed on the first two days of battle.

After this engagement, the Greek navy at Artemisium received news of the defeat at Thermopylae. Since their strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, and given their losses, the Greek navy decided to withdraw to Salamis. The Persians then captured the evacuated Athens. 

Seeking a decisive victory over the Allied fleet, the Persian fleet attacked, but were defeated at the Battle of Salamis in late 480 BC. Fearing to be trapped in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia, leaving Mardonius to complete the conquest of Greece. The following year, however, saw a Greek army decisively defeat the Persians at the Battle of Plataea, thereby ending the Persian invasion.

Both ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as an example of the power of a patriotic army of freemen defending native soil. The performance of the defenders at the battle of Thermopylae is also used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds.

Coriolis effect

The Coriolis effect is a force that is found in a rotating object. Gaspard Gustave de Coriolis first described the Coriolis effect in 1835 using mathematics. It is a fictitious force that acts upon all bodies which are described using a rotating frame of reference. The force is perpendicular to both the axis of movement of the body it acts on as well as that of the frame of reference.

Battle of Artemisium

The naval Battle of Artemesium took place at the same time as the Battle of Thermopylae, in 480 BC.

Approaching Artemisium towards the end of summer, the Persian navy was caught in a gale off the coast of Magnesia and lost around a third of their ~1,200 ships. 

After arriving at Artemisium, the Persians sent a detachment of 200 ships around the coast of Euboea in an attempt to trap the Greeks, but these were caught in another storm and shipwrecked. 

The main action of the battle took place after two days of smaller engagements. The two sides fought all day, with roughly equal losses; however the smaller Allied fleet could not afford the losses.

After the engagement, the Allies received news of the defeat of the Allied army at Thermopylae. Their strategy was to hold both Thermopylae and Artemisium. So, given their losses, the Allies decided to withdraw to Salamis. The Persians overran Boeotia and captured the now-evacuated Athens. However, seeking a decisive victory over the Allied fleet, the Persians were later defeated at the Battle of Salamis in late 480

However, if dirt and debris get into the drive, they can cause the disks to crash.The crash itself then sends more debris which can make things worse. It is important to back up files before a head crash. Head crashes make sounds. Hard drive failures can also be caused by bearings, parts found in the drive motor.

Wilderness

Wilderness or wildland is a natural environment on Earth which has not been much disturbed by humans. 

Wilderness areas can be found in reserves, estates, farms, conservation areas, ranches, National Forests, National Parks and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches or any undeveloped areas. These areas are important for the survival of species, biodiversity, ecology, conservation, solitude, and recreation. 

Wilderness is deeply valued for cultural, spiritual, moral, and aesthetic reasons. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity. 

They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos, arboretums or laboratories.

From this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being "wilderness". Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered "wild." This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without human interference.

The WILD Foundation states that wilderness areas have two dimensions: they must be biologically intact and legally protected. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) classifies wilderness at two levels, Ia (Strict Nature Preserves) and Ib (Wilderness areas). 

Probably no place on earth is completely untouched by humanity, either due to past occupation by indigenous people, or through global processes such as climate change. Activities on the margins of specific wilderness areas, such as fire suppression and the interruption of animal migration, also affect the wilderness.

Especially in wealthier, industrialized nations, it has a specific legal meaning as well: as land where development is prohibited by law. Many nations have designated wilderness, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. 

Many new parks are currently being planned and legally passed by various Parliaments and Legislatures at the urging of dedicated individuals around the globe who believe that "in the end, dedicated, inspired people empowered by effective legislation will ensure that the spirit and services of wilderness will thrive and permeate our society, preserving a world that we are proud to hand over to those who come after us".

Iodine compounds

Iodine compounds are chemical compounds that have iodine ions in them. Iodine is found in several oxidation states: -1, +1, +3, +5, and +7. -1 compounds are the most common as iodides. +1 and +3 compounds are quite rare. +5 and +7 compounds are found as iodates and periodates, respectively.

-1 compounds are normally found as iodides. Most organic iodine compounds have iodine in this oxidation state. Most iodides are colorless or reddish-yellow and are weak reducing agents.


+1 compounds are found as hypoiodous acid (hypoiodites) or iodine monochloride. They are oxidizing agents.

+3 compounds are found as iodine trichloride or iodine trifluoride. Iodites, analog of chlorites, do not exist. They are strong oxidizing agents.

+5 compounds are all strong oxidizing agents. The iodates are colorless.


+7 compounds are all strong oxidizing agents. The periodates are the most common +7 compounds.

Barred Owl

The barred owl is a large owl commonly found in the eastern United States. 

The barred owl grow 43 to 61 centimeters (17 to 21 in) with a wingspan of 102 to 127 centimeters (40 to 50 in) at full length. The average male weigh 630 grams (22 oz) and female weigh 800 grams (28 oz). It has a round head with dark brown eyes while most owls in the eastern United States have yellow eyes. The barred owl lives about 10 to 12 years in the wild.

The barred owl lives in the woods across the eastern United States, southern Canada and Alaska. They sometimes migrate to Central America in the winter. The great horned owl is the only predator of the barred owl.

The barred owl makes nests on tree limbs and are usually near ponds or lakes. They may use nests that have been left by other animals. They can lay 1 to 5 eggs. Eggs hatch in 28 days and the young begin to fly 42 days later. 
The barred owl eats rabbits, squirrels, bats, snakes, and small insects. They are able to find food from a far distance from its great hearing sense. They can also hunt fish.

<doc id="272930" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=272930" title="Impedance">
Impedance

Impedance and resistance are very much related:

In the case of the resistance, a resistor resists any current going through it. The higher the resistance, the higher the voltage that is needed to achieve a given current. The formula is:

formula_1, where V is the voltage, R is the resistance, and I is the current.

In the case of the impedance, an inductor resists changes to the current and the capacitor resists changes to the voltage.

The key difference between resistance and impedance is the word "change", the rate of the change affects the impedance. Usually the "change" is expressed as a frequency, the number of times per second the current or voltage change direction. The formulas are:

For the inductor:
formula_2

For the capacitor:
formula_3

Where Z is the symbol for impedance, j is the imaginary number formula_4, formula_5 is the constant pi, f is the frequency, L is the inductance and C is the capacitance. The units for the resistance and the impedance are the same, the ohm with the symbol formula_6 (capital omega).

As indicated by the formulas above, the impedance varies depending on the frequency, in the case of the inductor and the capacitor it's a linear dependency, but for other components the dependency can be more complex. Every medium that can have a wave has an impedance, even empty space (light is a wave and it can travel in space) has an impedance of about 377formula_6.

Similarly to the resistance, the higher the impedance, the higher the voltage that is needed to achieve a given current. The formula is:

formula_8, where V is the voltage, Z is the impedance, and I is the current.

At the physical level, simplifying many things:

One important difference between the resistance and the impedance is that a resistor will dissipate energy, it gets hot, but an inductor and a capacitor store the energy and can return that energy to the source when it goes down.

If the impedance of the source, cable and load are not all equal, then a fraction of the signal is reflected back to the source, wasting power and creating interference. The ratio of the reflection can be calculated with:

Across a resistor, both the voltage and the current goes up and down at the same time, they are said to be in phase, but with an impedance it's different, the voltage is shifted by 1/4 wavelength behind the current in a capacitor, and forward in an inductor.

A 1/4 wavelength is usually represented with the imaginary number "j", which is also equivalent to a 90 degree shift.

The use of the imaginary number "j" makes the mathematics much simpler, it allows to calculate the total impedance the same way as it's done with resistors, for example a resistor plus an impedance in series is R+Z, and in parallel it's (R*Z)/(R+Z).

As many of you have heard, North Korea bombed one of South Korea's islands. Currently, there is much speculation about what is going to happen in the future. It might be resolved soon, but it might get worse.

On November 23, 2010, Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, fired a missile on South Korea's border island of Yeonpyeong. This action has received a lot of attention worldwide, with many heads of state expressing their support for South Korea and condemnation of North Korea's actions.

There is much uncertainty about the events that might follow this incident. The bombing is being reported as the worst since the Korean War. What might follow the bombing is still being speculated, with many people fearing that another war between the two Koreas will be inititated.

Newspapers and other media have reported that many people have escaped the island to seek shelter on the mainland. Many houses have been burnt or damaged as a result of the bombing, with few casualties reported.

Mesa Verde National Park

Mesa Verde National Park is a U.S. National Park and UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is in Montezuma County, Colorado, United States. 

The Park was created in 1906 to protect some of the best preserved cliff dwellings in the world. The UNESCO listing was, with Yellowstone National Park, the first from the U.S.A. 

The park occupies 81.4 square miles (211 square kilometers) near the Four Corners and features ruins of homes and villages built by the ancestral Puebloan people, sometimes called the Anasazi. 

The ancestral Puebloans made these stone villages their home in the 13th century. However, the first ancestral Puebloans had settled in Mesa Verde over 600 years before the cliff dwellings were ever built.

These first people are known as the Basketmakers and they lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in the overhangs of the cliffs. These hunter-gatherer people settled and began farming and using the bow and arrow, a weapon that was more efficient and accurate than the atlatl.

By 750 AD, the people were building mesa-top villages made of adobe. By the late 12th century they began to build the cliff dwellings for which Mesa Verde is famous.

Mesa Verde is best known for cliff dwellings, which are structures built within caves and under outcropping in cliffs — including Cliff Palace, which is thought to be the largest cliff dwelling in North America. The Spanish term "Mesa Verde" translates into English as "green table". Approximately 600 of the over 4700 archeological sites found in Mesa Verde National Park are cliff dwellings.

Mesa Verde National Park is in the south-western corner of the state of Colorado.

Elevations in the park range from about . The terrain is dominated by ridges and valleys running roughly north and south. The northernmost point is 13.2 miles (21.2 kilometers) farther north than the southernmost.

Although explorers from Spain went through the general region in the 18th century, actual sight of the cliffs dwellings by outsiders seems to have first occurred in the latter half of the 19th century. 

The fame of Mesa Verde soon began to spread thanks to the Wetherill ranchers and the archeological work of Gustaf Nordenskiöld. Vandalism led to President Teddy Roosevelt's support of protecting the area as a national park in 1906.

Shelling of Yeonpyeong

The shelling of Yeonpyeong was an exchange of artillery between the North and South Korean military on Yeonpyeong Island on 23 November 2010. After a South Korean artillery practice on the island, North Korea fired about 170 shells at Yeonpyeong. The shelling damaged the island greatly. It killed four South Koreans and hurt 19. At this, South Korea shelled North Korean gun positions. North Koreans said that they had fired the shells because they heard South Korean shells being fired into the North Korean part of the sea. Many nations disapproved of what the North did, and the tension (angry feelings) in Korea grew. The United Nations said that it was one of the most serious things that had happened after the end of the Korean War.

South Korea and the United States began the Hoguk exercise which they did every year. The Hoguk exercise was a large military practice with both South Korean and US militaries. The 2010 exercise used 70,000 soldiers from all four kinds of the South Korean military. They had 600 land vehicles, 90 helicopters, 50 warships, and 500 aircraft. The North Korean government felt that these exercises were a preparation for attacking the North, though the South and US said it was not.

On the morning of 23 November, North Korea said that it complained to the South, "asking whether (the [Hoguk] exercise) was an attack against the North". It said that it would not allow firing in what the North thought was its part of the sea. South Korean forces practiced firing in waters near Baengnyeong Island and Yeonpyeong Island in South Korean waters. According to a South Korean military official, the shells were fired towards waters in the south, away from North Korea. The firing was not part of the Hoguk exercise. It was a practice they did every month.

At 14:34 in Korean time, North Korea moved 22-mm Multiple Launch Rocket System shells towards an artillery place in Kaemori. Then it began firing on the island of Yeonpyeong. The firing went on 14:34 to 14:55 and again from 15:10 to 15:41. Many of the shells destroyed homes and shops. When they saw this, South Korea used 15mm self-propelled howitzers to fire about 80 shells at the North. The firing ended at about 16:42. It was the first artillery battle between North and South Korea since the 1970s. It was thought to be one of the most serious attacks by the North on the South since the Korean War ended. 

Several fires began because of the North Korean shelling, so the South Korean military moved civilians away from Yeonpyeong.

Two South Korean soldiers, Hasa (Sergeant) Seo Jeong-wu and Ilbyeong (Private First Class) Moon Gwang-wuk, were killed. Six other people in the military were seriously hurt. Two workers on the island, Kim Chi-baek, who was 61, and Bae Bok-chul, who was 60, were also killed. Many parts of the island were put on fire because of the attack. Most of the people living on the island were moved after the shelling. From the 1,780 people living there, about 1,500 moved away. Many of them moved to Incheon on the mainland. The Incheon city sent 22 fire engines and ambulances to the island.

Data loss

Data loss is an event that happens when a file, program, or a piece of information is lost. When data is updated, it may change, and this may not be data loss. Data loss also does not occur when the data is unavailable for some time only, for example because the server it is stored on cannot be reached. When this server can be reached again, the data will again be there. There are some common causes to data loss. Data loss can sometimes be prevented by creating a backup copy.A backup copy may contain an older version of a file, which can make data loss less severe. If certain information used by the system is lost, the system may stop working. Getting the system working again and restoring the data from a backup copy may take a long time. 

Sometimes a file or folder is accidentally (not meant to be done) deleted. Most of the time users have a special "recycling" bin to recover from, but the loss of system files can stop the system from working.

Sometimes the system could have run low on battery power and shut off automatically while saving or loading data, corrupting it.

Sometimes the system is accidentally unplugged, causing a corruption.

The user can shut the system off by themselves to corrupt unwanted data.

At any time a computer user can unplug the system and corrupt unwanted data.

James Hilton

James Hilton (9 September 1900 – 20 December 1954) was an English writer. He wrote several best-selling novels including "Lost Horizon" and "Goodbye Mr. Chips". "Lost Horizon" introduced an imaginary place called Shangri-La and made it popular. 

James Hilton was born in Leigh. His father, John Hilton, was the headmaster of Chapel End School in Walthamstow. James Hilton partially based the character Mr. Chipping in "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" on his father.

Hilton wrote his two most famous books while living in an ordinary semi-detached house on Oak Hill Gardens, Woodford Green. The house is still there, and a small, blue sign says it was Hilton's home.

He was married twice, first to Alice Brown and later to Galina Kopineck. Both marriages ended in divorce. He died in Long Beach, California from liver cancer.

Hilton became a success writer when he was still young. He published his first novel, "Catherine Herself," when he was 20 years old. Several of his books were international bestsellers. Some successful films were made based on his novels. Three of the best known movies are: "Lost Horizon" (1933), "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" (1934), and "Random Harvest" (1941). Many copies of "Lost Horizon" were sold in the 1930s as one of the first Pocket Books. The serial number was "1". Some people call it the novel that began the popularity of paperback books.

"Lost Horizon" is set in Tibet, and especially in a secret, imaginary valley called Shangri-La. Shangri-La now means any perfect, pleasurable place or utopia.

It is unsure exactly where and how Hilton got his ideas about Tibet. He may have been inspired to write "Lost Horizon" and to invent Shangri-La" by reading the "National Geographic Magazine" by Joseph Rock. Rock was an Austrian-American botanist and ethnologist who explored southwestern China and areas near Tibet. Hilton have also read articles by early travelers in Tibet that he found in the British Library for more ideas. Christian Zeeman may also have been the model for the hero of the story. He disappeared while living in Japan and there were rumors that he was living secretly in a Zen Buddhist monastery. Some say that the isolated valley town of Weaverville, California, in far northern Trinity County, was Shangri-La. However, this is a misunderstanding of a comment by Hilton in a 1941 interview. In that interview, Hilton said that Weaverville reminded him of Shangri-La. Coincidentally, Junction City (about 8 miles from Weaverville) now has a Tibetan Buddhist centre with the occasional Tibetan monks in saffron robes.

After the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, the US President Franklin D. Roosevelt told the press that the airplanes had taken off from Shangri-La. This was a kind of joke to hide the secret that they had taken off from aircraft carriers. Later, the US Navy gave that name to an aircraft carrier, and Roosevelt named his Maryland presidential retreat "Shangri-La". (That retreat is now called Camp David since President Dwight D. Eisenhower renamed it after his grandson. Zhongdian is a mountain region of Southwest China that has now been renamed Shangri-La (Xianggelila) because it may have inspired Hilton's book 

Hilton lived and worked in Hollywood beginning in the mid-1930s. He won an Academy Award in 1942 for his work on the screenplay of "Mrs. Miniver". That film was based on the novel by Jan Struther. Hilton was the host of "The Hallmark Playhouse" (1948–1953) for CBS Radio. One of his later novels, "Morning Journey", was about the movie business.


Some of Hilton's novels became films:

Hilton co-wrote the book and lyrics for "Shangri-La", an unsuccessful 1956 Broadway musical adaptation of "Lost Horizon".

Rocket Mania

Rocket Mania is a computer puzzle video game made by Nuclide Games and PopCap Games.

The player rotates fuses to launch rockets. Multiple rockets can be launched because the fuses have junctions. Players can get coins for launching rockets. Five coins will upgrade a rocket. The player goes through different ranks by earning points. Combos can also happen if a fuse launches and then falls.

The game starts at night, with a time limit. Depending on the level, the player will launch a certain number of rockets before they level up. The dragon automatically upgrades the rockets with coins, which in turn gives the player more points. Other types of items can also be awarded. Item values are based on rockets.

The game starts empty, with tiles filling up the board. The player must lead fuses to rockets before the board fills.

The player starts with a number of matches. Launching multiple rockets will bring bonus matches to the board, but they will burn out if left there. If the match is carried by the fuse light, the player gets the match. The game ends if the player runs out of matches.

In the 17th century, the place belonged to a Swedish noble.

In 1708, Peter the Great gave the estate to his wife as a present. She helped in the making of the Blagoveschenskaya church there in 1724, and changed the name of the place to Blagoveschenskoye. However, this soon went out of use.

It was Catherine I who started to develop the place as a place for royal people. She built the Catherine Palace, now known as the Cameron Gallery.

By the end of the 18th century, Tsarskoye Selo became a popular place for noble people to visit in the summer. On September 17, 1941 the Germans destroyed the town of Pushkin, destroying many historical buildings and other artifacts.

<doc id="273148" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=273148" title="Particle in a box">
Particle in a box

In quantum mechanics, the particle in a box model (also known as the infinite potential well or the infinite square well) describes a particle that can move freely between two walls. This is used to show the differences between classical and quantum systems. In classical systems, for example a ball trapped inside a heavy box, the particle can move at any speed within the box and it is no more likely to be found at one position than another. However, when the box becomes very narrow (on the scale of a few nanometers), quantum effects become important. The particle may only have certain energy levels. Likewise, it can never have zero energy, meaning that the particle can never "sit still". It is more likely to be found at certain places than at others, depending on its energy level. The particle may never be found at certain places, known as spatial nodes.

The particle in a box model provides one of the very few problems in quantum mechanics which can be solved without approximations. This means that the energy and position of the particle are related to the mass of the particle and the width of the well by simple mathematical expressions. Due to its simplicity, the model allows insight into quantum effects without the need for complicated mathematics. It is one of the first quantum mechanics problems taught in undergraduate physics courses, and it is commonly used as an approximation for more complicated quantum systems. See also: the history of quantum mechanics.

The simplest form of the particle in a box model considers a one-dimensional system. Here, the particle may only move backwards and forwards along a straight line with impenetrable barriers at either end.
The walls of a one-dimensional box may be visualised as regions of space with an infinitely large potential. Conversely, the interior of the box has a constant, zero potential. This means that no forces act upon the particle inside the box and it can move freely in that region. However, infinitely large forces repel the particle if it touches the walls of the box, preventing it from escaping. The potential in this model is given as
where formula_2 is the length of the box and formula_3 is the position of the particle within the box.

In quantum mechanics, the wavefunction gives the most fundamental description of the behavior of a particle; the measurable properties of the particle (such as its position, momentum and energy) may all be derived from the wavefunction.
The wavefunction formula_4 can be found by solving the Schrödinger equation for the system

where formula_6 is the reduced Planck constant, formula_7 is the mass of the particle, formula_8 is the imaginary unit and formula_9 is time.
To solve for formula_10 the first thing we do is assume that formula_10 is the product of two functions, formula_12

Substituting into formula_13 gives us:

Since the formula_15 is a constant relative to x, and formula_16 is constant relative to t, we can pull out the 'constants' out of the partial derivatives:

We can then divide the entire equation by formula_18

Now, the entire equation on the left is dependent on t, and the entire equation on the right is dependent on x. However, the only way this could be true would be if both sides are a constant. We can call this constant C. So now we have two equations:
and

Now we'll focus on solving for formula_15 the time dependent part of the equation:

Some algebraic manipulation gives us:

Solving this differential equation yields:

We then raise e to the powers of both sides to isolate formula_15:

We can then expand formula_15 with Eulers equation, and we get:

So we see that it's a wave with a frequency formula_31 . Therefore, formula_32

However, we can take it one step further, and say that in this case, formula_33

Substituting back into formula_28 gives us our final solution for the time dependent part of the function:

Continuing from before, we have:

As mentioned earlier, the definition of the 'particle in a box' scenario is that there is an infinite potential outside of the box, and no potential within the box. Therefore:

Substituting formula_38 within the box gives us:

Doing some algebra gives us:
The solutions for a differential equation of the form formula_41 where formula_42 are given to be
In our case, formula_46, and formula_47, so formula_48 and formula_49. For ease in writing, we'll set formula_50 , so our solution is formula_51

Therefore, we can say the form of formula_52 is:
formula_53

The wave function needs to be continuous, and because it is 0 outside of the walls of the well, it needs to be be 0 at the point formula_54. Therefore formula_55, and formula_56

On the same note, the wave function needs to be continuous, and as it is 0 outside of the walls of the well, it needs to be be 0 at the point formula_57. In order for that to be true, the sin must be 0. formula_58 is 0 at integer values of formula_59. Therefore formula_60, and formula_61where formula_62 is an integer.

Therefore, formula_63

One of the conditions of the wave function is that the probability of finding it somewhere the enclosed well must be a total of 1 (100%).
The size (or amplitude) of the wavefunction at a given position is related to the probability of finding a particle there by formula_64.
Therefore, formula_65, or

However, integrating the cos portion gives us:formula_69. Substituting in formula_61 gives us formula_71, because formula_72, where n is an integer is always 0.

Therefore, the only part remaining is the formula_73, which gives us formula_74, and after some algebraic manipulation, we reach our result of:

Now we have our solution for the spatial component:
formula_76, where n is an integer.

The first thing we did was assume that formula_10 is the product of two functions, formula_12

Therefore, our result for the time dependent Schrodinger equation is:

Because formula_82 and formula_60, we can combine the two: formula_84

After doing some algebra, we can solve for E (Energy) to be:

We can get an alternate form by substituting formula_86

The energy levels increase with formula_88, meaning that high energy levels are separated from each other by a greater amount than low energy levels are. The lowest possible energy for the particle (its "zero-point energy") is found in state 1 (when formula_89), which is given by
The particle, therefore, always has a positive energy. This contrasts with classical systems, where the particle can have zero energy by resting motionless at the bottom of the box. This can be explained in terms of the uncertainty principle, which states that the product of the uncertainties in the position and momentum of a particle is limited by
It can be shown that the uncertainty in the position of the particle is proportional to the width of the box. Thus, the uncertainty in momentum is roughly inversely proportional to the width of the box. The kinetic energy of a particle is given by formula_92, and hence the minimum kinetic energy of the particle in a box is inversely proportional to the mass and the square of the well width, in qualitative agreement with the calculation above.

In classical physics, the particle can be detected anywhere in the box with equal probability. In quantum mechanics, however, the probability density for finding a particle at a given position is derived from the wavefunction as formula_93 For the particle in a box, the probability density for finding the particle at a given position depends upon its state, and is given by
Thus, for any value of "n" greater than one, there are regions within the box for which formula_95, indicating that "spatial nodes" exist at which the particle cannot be found.

In quantum mechanics, the average, or expectation value of the position of a particle is given by
For the particle in a box, it can be shown that the average position is always formula_97, regardless of the state of the particle. In other words, the average position at which a particle in a box may be detected is exactly in the center of the quantum well; in agreement with a classical system.

If a particle is trapped in a two-dimensional box, it may freely move in the formula_3 and formula_99-directions, between barriers separated by lengths formula_100 and formula_101 respectively. Using a similar approach to that of the one-dimensional box, it can be shown that the wavefunctions and energies are given respectively by
where the two-dimensional wavevector is given by

For a three dimensional box, the solutions are
where the three-dimensional wavevector is given by

An interesting feature of the above solutions is that when two or more of the lengths are the same (e.g. formula_108), there are multiple wavefunctions corresponding to the same total energy. For example the wavefunction with formula_109 has the same energy as the wavefunction with formula_110. This situation is called "degeneracy" and for the case where exactly two degenerate wavefunctions have the same energy that energy level is said to be "doubly degenerate". Degeneracy results from symmetry in the system. For the above case two of the lengths are equal so the system is symmetric with respect to a 90° rotation.

Because of its mathematical simplicity, the particle in a box model is used to find approximate solutions for more complex physical systems in which a particle is trapped in a narrow region of low electric potential between two high potential barriers. These quantum well systems are particularly important in optoelectronics, and are used in devices such as the quantum well laser, the quantum well infrared photodetector and the quantum-confined Stark effect modulator.

Bee Train

Bee Train Production Inc. (ビィートレイン株式会社, Biītorein Kabushikigaisha?) usually referred to as Bee Train is Japanese anime studio in Japan. The studio was started in 1997 by a director named Koichi Mashimo with a few of his colleagues in 1997. The studio is most famous for showing strong female characters with a light lesbian attraction.

1997 a Japanese anime director Koichi Mashimo had been working around Japan as director on his own (not employed to one single company) with a group of other artists. The goal of Mashimo was to start a studio that would encourage and help young artists. To do this, Mashimo went to a friend of his at another studio called Production I.G. The company president agreed to help Mashimo with his plan and helped start it. .

The first few years the two studios worked together on anime based on popular video games then Bee Train studio grew big enough to work more on its own. Later the studio was given a project of short videos to tie in with a new video game series called .hack (said as "dot hack"). In addition to the new set of videos the studio was also given a 26 episode television series. The next years would be met with new additions to the game series and the studio's famous "girls-with-guns" trilogy. 

In 2006 Bee Train left its parent company Production I.G and became independent. The two studios still have a good relationship with each other and work together on projects occasionally. 

2009-2010 the studio expanded to include two new areas called C-Station and D-Station.. Bee Train also has another small office called Studio Road. Studio Road does the color work for anime.

He is also known as the Iceman, Similaun Man, Frozen Fritz, and Man from Hauslabjoch. He is Europe's oldest natural human mummy, and has offered an new picture of Chalcolithic (Copper Age) Europeans. 

There was a bit of a diplomatic struggle between Austria and Italy for the ownership of the body. His body and belongings are now displayed in the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano in the Southern Tyrol (Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol).

There was also a long legal struggle by the finders, Helmut and Erika Simon, for a suitable reward. After many court hearings, the provincial government agreed to pay Erika Simon €150,000. By that time 17 years had passed, and her husband was dead.

In 2001 X-rays and a CT scan revealed that Ötzi had an arrowhead lodged in his left shoulder when he died, and a matching small tear on his coat. 

The discovery of the arrowhead led researchers to think Ötzi died of blood loss from the wound, which would likely have been fatal even if modern medical techniques had been available. 

Further research found that the arrow's shaft had been removed before death, and close examination of the body found bruises and cuts to the hands, wrists and chest. Cerebral trauma suggested a blow to the head. One of the cuts was to the base of his thumb that reached down to the bone but had no time to heal before his death. 

At present it is believed that death was caused by a blow to the head. Researchers are unsure if this was due to a fall, or from being struck with a rock by another person.

Apparently, the iceman had 57 tattoos.

The tattoos were carbon (soot). There were groups of short, parallel, vertical lines to both sides of the lumbar spine, a cross-shaped mark behind the right knee, and various marks around both ankles. 

X-ray examination of his bones showed "age-conditioned or strain-induced degeneration" in these areas. These tattoos may have been related to pain relief treatments similar to acupuncture.
If so, this is at least 2000 years before their previously known earliest use in China (c. 1000 BC).

Peter Waldo

Peter Waldo, Valdo, or Waldes ("c". 1140 – "c". 1218), also Pierre Vaudès or de Vaux, is believed by many to have started the Waldensians. This was a Christian spiritual movement of the Middle Ages. People are still alive in southern Europe who come from this movement. Because not much was written down about Waldo while he was alive, people do not agree how important he was to the Waldensians, because it may have been around before his leadership. Also, the French historian Thuanus thought Waldo died in the year 1179.

Not know many details are known about the life of Waldo. Some sources say that he was a rich man who sold clothes, and that he was a merchant from Lyon. Also, sources say that he had some education. Sometime not long before the year 1160 he was inspired by some events. One of these was hearing a sermon on the life of St. Alexius. Another was when saying that one did not believe in transubstantiation (which is the belief that, during Communion, the bread and wine turn into the body and blood of Jesus Christ) became a crime for which one could be punished by death. A third event was the sudden death of a friend during an evening meal. After this, he began living a radical Christian life. He gave his property to his wife. He gave the rest of his things to the poor. 

At about this time, Waldo began to preach and teach publicly about his ideas of living simple lives and about poverty. He taught that "No man can serve two masters, God and mammon", and strongly criticized things done by the Papal and things taught by the Roman Catholic Church. Some of the things taught by the Catholic Church that he criticized were purgatory and transubstantiation. He said that the Roman Catholic Church was the prostitute from the book of Revelation. By 1170, many people were following him. These people were called "the Poor of Lyon", "the Poor of Lombardy", or "the Poor of God" who would spread their teaching abroad while dressed up as peddlers. Often called the Waldensians (or Waldenses), they were different from the Albigensians or Cathari. 

The Waldensian movement had lay preaching (people who were not preachers or priests for a living preached), people who were poor by choice, and strictly obeying the Bible. Between 1175-1185, Waldo either had a cleric from Lyons translate the New Testament of the Bible into the language that most people spoke, the Arpitan (Franco-Provençal) language, or translate it himself.

In 1179, Waldo and one of his followers went to Rome, where they were welcomed by Pope Alexander III, and the Roman Curia. They had to explain what they believed in front of a panel of three clergymen, including issues which were then debated within the Church. These included the idea that all people were priests, teaching the gospel in the language most people spoke, and people living poor, simple lives on purpose. The results of the meeting were inconclusive, and Waldo's ideas, but not the movement itself, were condemned at the Third Lateran Council in the same year, although the leaders of the movement had not been yet excommunicated (kicked out of the Church). 

Sent away from Lyon, Waldo and his followers moved to the high valleys of Piedmont, and in France, in the Luberon. Finally, Waldo was excommunicated by Pope Lucius III during the synod held at Verona in 1184, and the doctrine of the Poor of Lyon was again condemned by the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 where they are mentioned by name for the first time, and called heresy. The Roman Catholic Church began to persecute the Waldensians, and many were tried and sentenced to death in different European countries during the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries. The Waldensians survived by moving the Alps and hiding there. Centuries after his death, the Waldensian denomination joined the Genevan or Reformed branch of the Protestant Reformation.

Siberian Intervention

The Siberian Intervention (1918-1922) was part of a larger plan by the Western powers and Japan. They wanted to support the White Russians against the Bolshevik Red Army during the Russian Civil War. The Allied Forces left by 1920, but the Imperial Japanese Army stayed in Siberia until 1922. The European soldiers went to the Russian Maritime Provinces. 

The Siberian Intervention came quickly after the Russian October Revolution of 1917. The new Bolshevik government signed a separate peace treaty with Germany. That was a serious problem for the Entente powers. The treaty ended fighting for the Germans facing Russia. Germany could then move soldiers from east to west; against Europe. The peace agreement also allowed Germany to get many supplies from Murmansk, Arkhangelsk and Vladivostok. In addition, a 50,000 man Czech Legion had been fighting on the side of the Allies. They became trapped. The Czechs were trying to fight their way out to the east to Vladivostok along the Trans-Siberian Railway. However, the Bolsheviks controlled that railway.

Great Britain and France decided to use military power and join the Russian Civil War against the Bolshevik government because of all of those problems. They had three goals: 
The British and French did not have enough soldiers, so the asked the United States to help. They asked the U.S. to send soldiers to both the North Russia Campaign and the Siberian Campaign. President Wilson agreed in July 1918 even though the War Department said not to help. The U.S. sent two groups of soldiers: 5,000 soldiers were the American North Russia Expeditionary Force (nicknamed the Polar Bear Expedition); and 10,000 were called the American Expeditionary Force Siberia. In the same month, the Russian White movement asked the Beiyang government of the Republic of China to send men. They sent 2,000 soldiers by August. The Chinese later occupied Outer Mongolia and Tuva. They sent a battalion to the North Russian Campaign to fight against the Bolsheviks.

The British had few soldiers sending only 1,500 troops to Siberia. These soldiers came from 9th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment and the 25th Battalion Middlesex Regiment.

The Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force was commanded by Major General James H. Elmsley. The Canadian government approved the mission in August 1918. The Canadian soldiers were sent to Vladivostok to support the allied armies already there. There were 4,192 soldiers in the group. They returned to Canada between April and June 1919. The Canadians did little fighting. Fewer than 100 troops left the base area to go to Omsk. Those 100 worked as administrative staff for 1,500 British troops who were helping the White Russian government of Admiral Alexander Kolchak. Most Canadians stayed in Vladivostok. They did routine practice and worked as police in the unstable port city.

The Italian soldiers were most active in three areas: Irkutsk, Harbin, and Vladivostok.
The American Expeditionary Force Siberia was commanded by Major General William S. Graves. At its largest, it was 7,950 officers and enlisted men.

The Allies began to work together in Siberia in August 1918. The Japanese entered through Vladivostok and places along the Manchurian border. They sent more 70,000 soldiers. The Allies worried about Japanese plans because they sent such a large group. On September 5, the Japanese met the leading group of the Czech Legion. A few days later the British, Italian and French groups joined the Czechs to try to restart the war in the east. They tried to make a new battle line beyond the Ural Mountains. This meant that the European allies moved west. The Japanese had their own goals. They would not go west of Lake Baikal and stayed behind. The Americans were suspicious of Japanese plans.They also stayed behind to watch the Japanese. By November, the Japanese controlled all ports and major towns in the Russian Maritime Provinces and in Siberia east of the city of Chita. 

In the summer of 1918 onwards, the Japanese army supported White Russian groups; the 5th infantry division and the Japanese-backed Special Manchurian Detachment of Grigory Semyonov took control over Transbaikalia. They started a White Transbaikalia government, but it did not last long.

Planck time

The Planck time is the length of time at which no smaller meaningful length can be validly measured due to the indeterminacy expressed in Werner Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. It is thought to be the shortest period of time known so far.
One Planck time is the time it would take a photon travelling at the speed of light to cross a distance equal to one Planck length.
It is figured out from the Planck constant, which was first thought of by the physicist Max Planck in 1900. This work by Planck asserts that the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency, and their relation can be put in terms of familiar units such as the joule by using the proportionality constant Planck gave us. Heisenberg's original quantum theory was improved by his teacher and colleague Max Born. Born put Heisenberg's equation into a matrix form. Born immediately noticed that to calculate using these matrices one matrix had to be multiplied by another matrix. In matrix multiplication multiplying matrix P by matrix X gives a different result from the one obtained by multiplying matrix X by matrix P. He further noticed that the difference between the two matrices involves h, the Planck proportionality constant. It shows that one can never pin down things like P (momentum) and X (location) exactly. It turns out that we cannot pin down a time any better than we can pin down a place or a momentum. We get closer and closer and then we reach the "Planck time."

<doc id="273227" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=273227" title="Pointillism">
Pointillism

Pointillism is a way of painting in which small separate dots of pure color are used to form images. The artist paints the picture with hundreds of tiny dots, mainly of red, yellow, blue and green, with white. The eye and mind of the viewer mix the colours to make different shades of these colours, as well as orange, purple, pink, and brown depending on the way the dots of colour are arranged. 

Georges Seurat, who at first worked with the Impressionist painters, first used this technique (a way of doing something) in 1886. Other important artists were Paul Signac, Camille Pissarro and, in some paintings, Vincent van Gogh. Art critics who saw their work, laughed at it and called it "Pointillism" as an insult. This name is still used, but is no longer thought of as an insult.

Pointillism is very different to the traditional ways that artists use to blend pigments (mix colours) on a palette. Pointillist painters do not mix the colours on the palette at all- they just use the bright colours straight out of the tube. Traditional painters, and Impressionist painters use many different types of brushstrokes, and many dfferent textures of paint. The surface of the painting may have flat colour, lines, squiggles and dabs of paint, but in a Pointillist painting, every part of the picture is done in tiny dots, and most of the dots are about the same size. Pointillism is usually done in oil paints, because they are thick and do not run into each other when they are painted on the canvas.

Many colour printers and large printing presses use four colours to print in tiny dots of Cyan (blue), Magenta (red), Yellow, and Key (black). Televisions and computer monitors use a similar technique to show many different colors using only Red, Green, and Blue.

The name Pointillism is also given to a style of 20th-century music. Different musical notes are made separately from each other, giving a sound texture similar to pointillism. This type of music is also known as "punctualism" or "klangfarbenmelodie".

That eventually leads to you using Wikia as a last resort. But then you realize the real reason you vandalized is because you were testing!
And without knowing the wiki format, how can you make your very own wiki?

And this eventually means your whole life will revolve around finding other wikis to burrow in. Unfortunately all their checkusers kick you out!

In telecommunications, Baud is the unit to measure the symbol rate. If one symbol can be transmitted per second, this is equal to one Baud. The unit is named after Jean-Maurice-Émile Baudot a French telecommunications engineer who innvented the Baudot code. The Baud rate is different from the gross bit rate, measured in "bits/second". As an example, gigabit ethernet has a symbol rate of 125MBd. Gigabit ethernet uses pulse-amplitude modulation and can transmit two bits of payload data per symbol. Gigabit ethernet uses four wires for transmission.

Sam Francis

Samuel Lewis Francis (June 25, 1923, San Mateo, California – November 4, 1994, Santa Monica, California) was an American painter and printmaker. He was born in San Mateo, California, and studied botany, medicine and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. He served in the United States Air Force during World War II before being injured in a plane crash. He was in the hospital for several years, and it was while he was there that he began to paint. Once he was out of the hospital he returned to Berkeley, this time to study art.

Francis was initially influenced by the work of abstract expressionists such as Mark Rothko, Arshile Gorky and Clyfford Still. He spent the 1950s in Paris, having his first exhibition there in 1952. While there he became associated with Tachisme. He later spent time in Japan, and some have seen an influence from Zen Buddhism in Francis’ work.

Francis spent some time in Paris making entirely monochromatic works, but his mature pieces are generally large oil paintings with splashed or splattered areas of bright contrasting colour. Areas of white canvas are often left to show through, and in later works, paint is sometimes confined to the edges of the canvas.

Francis returned to California during the 1960s and continued painting in Los Angeles. During the final three decades of his career his style of large scale bright Abstract Expressionism was also closely associated with Color Field painting. During the last year of his life, suffering from prostate cancer and unable to paint with his right hand after a fall, in a final burst of energy he used his left hand to complete a dazzling series of about 150 small paintings before he died. He was buried in Olema, in Marin County, California.

After the death of the artist, the Samuel L. Francis Foundation, Inc. (also known as the "Samuel L. Francis Art Museum, Inc." or the "Sam Francis Foundation") was founded. The Foundation not only serves as his official Estate, but also has a mission "to research, document, protect and perpetuate the creative legacy of [Francis]." The U.S. copyright representative for the Francis Foundation is the Artists Rights Society.

As of 2008, the Foundation is working to create a Catalogue Raisonné of Francis's work. In addition to collecting information on known Francis works, they also have a page dedicated to "missing works" for which they are seeking any information interested parties may have. 

In 2010, artist and filmmaker Jeffrey Perkins released the documentary "The Painter Sam Francis". The documentary includes film of Francis at work, filmed between 1968 and the early '90s together with interviews with friends, family, and professional associates of Francis.

Potassium iodate

Potassium iodate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is KIO. It has potassium and iodate ions in it.

Potassium iodate is a white solid. It is a strong oxidizing agent. It is similar to potassium bromate and potassium chlorate. It reacts violently with many reducing agents.

Potassium iodate is made by reacting iodic acid with potassium hydroxide or by reacting iodine with potassium hydroxide. This second reaction makes the iodide and the iodate. 

Potassium iodate is used to add iodine to salt. It is better than potassium iodide because it does not oxidize to iodine and evaporate like potassium iodide does. It is sometimes used in flour just like potassium bromate. 

It is also used for radiation protection. A nuclear explosion can make radioactive iodine, which goes into the thyroid and can make cancer. Eating potassium iodate makes the thyroid full of nonradioactive iodine and prevents radioactive iodine from going in. It lasts longer than potassium iodide.

<doc id="273305" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=273305" title="Tuff">
Tuff

Tuff (from Italian "tufo") is a type of rock produced by the eruption of volcanoes.

It consists of consolidated volcanic ash ejected from vents during a volcanic eruption. Rock that has more than 50% tuff is called "tuffaceous". The chemical and mineral composition of tuffs varies according to what was in the molten magma.

The products of a volcanic eruption are volcanic gases, lava, steam, and tephra (fragments). Magma is blown apart by volcanic gases and steam. Solid material produced and thrown into the air by such volcanic eruptions is called "tephra", regardless of composition or fragment size. If the pieces of ejecta are small , the material is called "volcanic ash", defined as such particles less than 2 mm in diameter, sand-sized or smaller. These particles are small, slaggy pieces of magma and rock that have been tossed into the air by outbursts of steam and other gases.

Among the loose beds of ash that cover the slopes of many volcanoes, three classes of materials are represented. 

In some great volcanic explosions nothing but materials of the second kind were emitted, as at Mount Bandai in Japan in 1888. There have also been many eruptions in which the quantity of broken sedimentary rocks that mingled with the ash is very great. 

These materials, in contrast to true ashes, tend to occur in "angular fragments". When they form a large part of the mass the rock is more properly a 'volcanic breccia' than a tuff. A breccia is a rock with sharp-edged fragments in it.

The ashes vary in size from large blocks twenty feet or more in diameter to the minutest impalpable dust. The large masses are called 'volcanic bombs'; they have mostly a rounded, elliptical or pear-shaped form owing to rotation in the air before they solidified. Many of them have ribbed or nodular surfaces, and sometimes they have a crust intersected by many cracks like the surface of a loaf of bread. Any ash in which they are very abundant is called an agglomerate.

A tuff of recent origin is generally loose, but the older tuffs have usually been cemented together by pressure and the action of infiltrating water. This makes rocks which, while not very hard, are strong enough to be used for building purposes (e.g. in the neighborhood of Rome). 

Many volcanoes stand near the sea, and the ashes cast out by them are mingled with the sediments that are gathering at the bottom of the waters. In this way ashy muds or sands or even in some cases ashy limestones are formed. As a matter of fact most of the tuffs found in the older rock formations contain mixtures of clay, sand, and sometimes fossil shells, which prove that they were beds spread out under water.

During some volcanic eruptions a layer of ashes several feet in thickness is deposited over a considerable district, but such beds thin out rapidly as the distance from the crater increases, and ash deposits covering many square miles are usually very thin. 

The showers of ashes often follow one another after longer or shorter intervals, and hence thick masses of tuff, whether of subaerial or of marine origin, have mostly a stratified character. In the fine beds it is often developed in great perfection.

Welded tuff is a pyroclastic lava flow which was hot enough, at the time of deposition, to weld together. During welding, the glass shards and pumice fragments adhere together (necking at point contacts), deform, and compact together. 

A hot lava flow welded by heat can be highly voluminous, such as the Lava Creek Tuff erupted from Yellowstone Caldera in Wyoming 640,000 years ago. Lava Creek Tuff was at least 1000 times as large as the deposits of the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. It had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 8—greater than any eruption known in the last 10,000 years.

Basaltic tuffs are occur widely. They are found in Skye, Mull, Antrim and other places, where there are tertiary volcanic rocks; in Scotland, Derbyshire and Ireland among the carboniferous strata; and among the still older rocks of the Lake District, southern uplands of Scotland and Wales. 

Basaltic tuffs are black, dark green or red in colour. They vary greatly in coarseness. Often submarine, they may contain shale, sandstone, grit and other sedimentary material, and are occasionally fossiliferous. Recent basaltic tuffs are found in Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Jan Mayen, Sicily, Sandwich Islands, Samoa, etc.

Fading Echoes (Warriors)

Fading Echoes is the 2nd book in the fourth "Warriors" series, "Omen of the Stars". It includes another point of view in the story, which is Ivypaw, Dovepaw's sister.

This takes place around a fictional lake, with an island over by the south side of it, for Gatherings.

Dovepaw learns to hone her ability to sense farther than any cat around the lake, while her bond with Ivypaw dwindles in the middle of the story, due to Dovepaw not being allowed to share her secret with any cat except for Lionblaze, Jayfeather, and eventually Firestar. The reason for her being able to tell Firestar is this. She senses Sedgewhisker, one of the cats who had gone on the journey with, and her patrol get attacked by dogs. Sedgewhisker was the only cat hurt, so she and Ivypaw go to see her, but they get caught, resulting in them being escorted back to their camp. Firestar realizes that Dovepaw, Lionblaze, and Jayfeather are the Three in the prophecy that the series is centering around. 

Tigerheart and Dovepaw try to make friends, but can not as their duties keep them apart, except for the Gathering. Even then, he does not reveal what he was doing on ThunderClan territory. He gets close, though.

Later, Dovepaw save most of the Clan from injuries by sensing a tree when it is about to fall. The Clan evacuates, but Longtail gets killed and Briarpaw, later Briarlight, gets her spine broken. The four stories join together soon after.

Jayfeather reads Mothwing's mind (that's part of his power) and discovers that StarClan had made a good choice of RiverClan medicine cat after all, then is cornered by Lionblaze, who asks about the stick Jayfeather had broken. He tells the story of the stick, then they talk about the prophecy. Later, Dovepaw lets it slip (the prophecy), and then the Three and Firestar talk about the prophecy, and they then can work with him. After this conversation, Jayfeather discovers Tigerheart on ThunderClan territory, then starts to question him, trying to get answers. 

He soon must care for Briarlight after a tree falls on her. He goes to see Littlecloud for help, and discovers that she has lost all feeling in her hind legs because the tree fell on her spine. Later, he tries to treat a perhaps deadly cough from her not being able to walk properly.

Meanwhile, he discovers that some cats in the Clans are being trained by Dark Forest cats, meaning that the Three would soon have to fight the Dark Forest cats and their army.

There the stories collide.

Lionblaze trains his apprentice, Dovepaw, when she senses a WindClan patrol being attacked by dogs. The next day, Dovepaw makes a big blunder(mistake) and lets slip how she knew about the patrol being attacked. Firestar discovers then that they are the Three.

After the Tigerheart on ThunderClan territory incident, Lionblaze soon must help with the falling tree. He helps to rebuild the camp with the materials that are now available with the tree having fallen.

There, the stories combine.

Ivypaw's story begins when she starts having dreams. She is unknowingly being trained to be in the Dark Forest's army, and she gets stronger and quicker. She has a row (basically, an argument) with Dovepaw, and their bond starts to weaken. 

Much later, she has a "sign" that ShadowClan is going to take the territory up to Jayfeather's herbs, and then the stories all combine.

Ivypaw, Dovepaw, and Lionblaze all join into the major fight that happens as a result of Ivypaw, and the tree climbing techniques come in handy for the battle. ThunderClan wins the fight, but each Clan loses a life. Firestar loses his semifinal(second to last) life. Russetfur dies.

Starlight (Warriors)

Starlight is the fourth book in the second series of "Warriors", "The New Prophecy".

This book, and all following books in this series, takes place around a fictional lake. The lake has a small island in the southern end of it, and it has moorland, pine forest, deciduous forest (trees that lose their leaves in the winter), marsh, and some wooded area with more streams.

Leafpaw has to care for her Clan along with Cinderpelt, and she has a medium part in the novel. She stays with the rest of the Clans when the journeying cats went around the lake, finding some suitable territory. She does find the Moonpool in the middle of the book, earning her her name, Leafpool. Also, she loves Crowfeather (which is forbidden, as Leafpool is a medicine cat and Crowfeather is a cat in another Clan), and eventually gets caught in the next book. But back to the point. Leafpool discovers that Brambleclaw had been talking with Hawkfrost and Tigerstar in dreams. She wonders if he is loyal to the Clan.

Squirrelpaw gets her name sooner than Leafpool, and her name is Squirrelflight. She goes around the lake, and she is the one to find an ideal camp for ThunderClan. Once the Clan reaches the camp, Squirrelflight starts liking Ashfur instead, due to Brambleclaw speaking with his halfbrother at Gatherings. She, like Leafpool, wonders if Brambleclaw is loyal to ThunderClan. Eventually, though, they come to like each other again.

Brambleclaw goes around the lake. Later, he starts having dreams. In those dreams, he talks with Tigerstar and Hawkfrost.

Proposition

A proposition is a term in philosophy and logic. It is a sentence which says something is true or false. The sentence must be a meaningful statement. It must be possible to decide whether the proposition is true or not.

It is possible to express the same proposition in many ways, because a proposition is concerned with meaning, not with the mode of expression.
Two meaningful declarative sentences express the same proposition if and only if they mean the same thing.

This defines "proposition" in terms of synonymity. For example, "Snow is white" (in English) and "Schnee ist weiß" (in German) are different sentences, but they say the same thing, so they express the same proposition.

In Aristotelian logic, a proposition is a particular kind of sentence, one which affirms or denies a predicate of a subject. Aristotelian propositions take forms like "All men are mortal" and "Socrates is a man".

In logical positivism, a proposition whose truth value cannot possibly be decided is meaningless. This would include (in their opinion) statements about deities.

Many modern philosophers take the view that 'statement' and 'proposition' are synonyms, or ought to be.

Karst is a geological system of rocks where water has eroded (dissolved) the bedrock. If very extensive, karst can be a geographical or topographical feature.

Almost always, karst is formed in carbonate rocks, such as limestone or dolomite. Since carbonate sedimentary rocks are very common, karst areas occur all over the world.

Many karst regions display distinctive surface features, with sinkholes being the most common. However, karst surface features may be absent where the soluble rock is "mantled" (covered), such as by a non-soluble rock strata on top of the carbonate strata. Some karst regions include thousands of caves, and the water is generally underground.

Gravel is small, loose, rock particles. It is any loose rock that is larger than 2 mm (0.079 in) in its smallest dimension (about 1/12 of an inch) and no more than 64 mm (2.5 in).

Small gravel is composed of granules (>2 to 4 mm/0.079 to 0.16 in). Large gravel is called pebbles (>4 to 64 mm/0.16 to 2.5 in). 

Particles smaller than gravel are sand, larger particles are cobbles.

Gravel and sand are used for road surfaces, and for cement and Tarmac. Mixtures of gravel and sand mixed with various crushed material, are known as "aggregate" in the trade. This is used for drainage in the basement of roads, and other purposes.

Natural gravel comes from ancient beaches which have not consolidated (turned into solid rock). In effect, beaches from (for instance) the Jurassic are dug up in quarries. The material is then sifted into size categories. The gravel and sand is then sold on to engineering companies. Most natural sand and gravel is silica, SiO, in its chemistry. This is very hard-wearing.

However, if the material is originally in hard rock form, then it is first crushed. This enables the industry to offer other materials such as granite or limestone, normally in rock form, as gravel.

The open-cast mining and processing of gravel, sand and aggregate is a huge world-wide industry.

Fights between the East India Company and Dutch East India Company

There were many fights between the British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company just to get the monopoly of trade in other parts of the world.

There was a series of arguments between the two companies over one island, Singapore. The tensions between the two countries nearly became a war.

During the 19th century, the trade between India and China became very profitable. The British had Penang and Bencoolen as her ports to protect her ships from the strong weather in the sea. However, these two ports were of no match to Dutch's two ports, which were closer to the Straits of Melaka, the main trading route. There were very little profits for the British because of this. Therefore, the British needed to find a new port to solve this problem.

Sir Stamford Raffles arrived on the Singapore island in 1818 to set up a trading port to break the Dutch monopoly that they had. Seeing that there was no Dutch flags on the island, Raffles proceeded with signing the contract with the local ruler, Sultan Hussein. This contract allowed the British to be able to set up a port in Singapore in the south in exchange for a small sum of money.

After the British signed a second contract to gain control over the whole island, the Dutch complained to the British government that Singapore indirectly belonged to them as the main government was at the Malay Peninsular, which also governs Singapore. There were lots of discussions between the two countries. Everyone was worried a war might break out.

The Anglo-Dutch treaty solved this problem. The two companies traded their ports so that there is a line separating where the British and Dutch are.

Meson

Mesons are incredibly small subatomic particles that are made of one quark and one antiquark. Antiquarks are the antimatter counterpart of a regular quark, meaning that in a fraction of a second, the two quarks will annihilate each other. Since antimatter quarks have the opposite spin of regular quarks, their spins can cancel each other out, which forms a particle similar to a Higgs Boson. The name meson comes from Greek "mesos", meaning middle. This refers to the fact that their predicted mass was between the known masses of a proton and a neutron.

Mesons are Hadrons, which simply means that they are made of quarks. Since quarks have different fractional charges, Mesons can have a charge. However, the charges of the quarks may cancel out, forming an uncharged Meson. The rest of the Hadron family are known as baryons, which are made of three quarks. Since quarks all have a spin of 1/2, three of them will never add up to an integer spin. An integer spin is simply 0, 1, or 2. Particles with an integer spin are called bosons, which obey Bose-Einstein Statistics. This means that more than one boson can actually be in the same point in space at the same time. However, a Meson is made of one quark and one antiquark, which each do not have an integer spin. Particles which do not have an integer spin have a spin of 1/2 or 3/2. These particles with 1/2 spin are called Fermions because they obey Fermi-Dirac Statistics. This means that no more than one fermion can be in the same point in space at the same time. All known baryons and quarks (and antiquarks) are fermions, and all mesons are bosons. This can get very confusing because this means that more than one meson can exist in the same point in space at the same time, but the quarks that make up mesons cannot exist in the same point in space at the same time.

The most common natural way that we find Mesons are through the interactions of cosmic rays with matter. This process can be duplicated in particle accelerators, which smash high-energy quarks and antiquarks. However, the Mesons are very unstable and quickly turn into other particles. Charged Mesons can decay into electrons and neutrinos, and uncharged Mesons can decay into photons. Since antimatter is destroying matter, a large amount of energy is created. The energy follows the equation E=mc.

Metriacanthosauridae

Metriacanthosaurids were a family of carnivorous theropod dinosaurs. They tended to be large predators, some growing to sizes of 30 ft (10 m). Metriacanthosaurids are carnosaurs, and many were initially classified within Megalosauridae or Allosauridae prior to recent analysis. A gigantic tooth belonging to what most likely is a giant metriacanthosaurid has been described recently by Xu and Clarke (2008).

Cladistically, Metriacanthosauridae was latest defined in 2005 by Paul Sereno as the most inclusive monophyletic group that contains "Metriacanthosaurus parkeri" and all species closer related to "Metriacanthosaurus" than to either "Allosaurus fragilis", "Carcharodontosaurus saharicus", or the House Sparrow ("Passer domesticus"). It is likely that these theropods represent or are close to the ancestors of the allosaurs.
Metriacanthosauridae is often referred to as "Sinraptoridae", but Metriacanthosauridae is the correct name under ICZN rules, since "Metriacanthosaurus" was the first member of the family to be described and named. 

The cladogram presented here follows a study by Benson and colleagues in 2010.

Belemnite

Belemnites (or belemnoids) are an extinct group of marine cephalopod, similar in many ways to the modern squid, and closely related to the modern cuttlefish. 

Like them, the belemnites possessed an ink sac, but, unlike the squid, they possessed ten arms of roughly equal length, and no tentacles.

The belemnites are a monophyletic group of super-order status, with five orders. 

The belemnites evolved from nautiloids, which are the basal group of cephalopods. Well-formed belemnite guards can be found in rocks dating from the Mississippian (or Lower Carboniferous).

Belemnites were numerous during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and their fossils are abundant in Mesozoic marine rocks, often with their cousins the ammonites. The belemnites and ammonites become extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period. 

Like some modern squid, belemnite arms carried a series of small hooks for grabbing prey. Belemnites were efficient carnivores that caught small fish and other marine animals with their arms and ate them with their beak-like jaws. 

In turn, belemnites appear to have formed part of the diet of marine reptiles such as Ichthyosaurs, whose fossilized stomachs frequently contain hooks from the arms of cephalopods.

Belemnites swam in near-shore to mid-shelf oceans.

Fossils which preserve the soft parts of belemnites show that, like many modern cephalopods, they had an ink sac, hard beaks, tail fins and large eyes. Well-preserved specimens show evidence of muscular fibers in the mantle, indicating that they were powerful swimmers like modern squids.

In 1826 Mary Anning discovered what appeared to be a chamber containing dried ink inside a belemnite fossil. She showed it to her friend Elizabeth Philpot who was able to revive the ink with water, and use it to illustrate some of her own ichthyosaur fossils. Other local artists were soon doing the same when more fossilised ink chambers were discovered. Anning noted how closely the chambers resembled the ink sacs of modern squid and cuttle fish, which she had dissected to better understand the anatomy of fossil cephalopods. This led William Buckland to publish that Jurassic belemnites had used ink for defence just as many modern cephalopods do.

Cheonggyecheon

Cheonggyecheon is a stream bisecting down town Seoul, South Korea. This stream has a length of 5.84 km(its trail-12.04 km long) and its greatest width is 84m. This stream is famous for restoration. It was a sewer of Seoul in the Joseon Dynasty. For half a century, industrial era after the Korean War, it had been entombed by pavement and had been a highway. After the restoration, Cheonggycheon has become an ecological park. The restoration of Cheonggyecheon took three years spending almost $400 million. Since its opening in 2005, hundreds of thousands of people have visited Cheonggyecheon with friends and family. Many interesting events have been often held at Cheonggyecheon as well.

It was originally called 'Gaecheon(Hangul:개천, Hanja:開川 ).' The Cheonggyecheon used to be a naturally formed stream before the Joseon Dynasty designated Seoul as its capital. This stream caused a flood and inundated private houses in full spate. In ordinary times, it was unsanitary because of standing sewage therein. Therefore, King Taejong, the third king of the Joseon Dynasty, firstly beginned river training work by starting construction work for an open channel. After that, King Yeongjo, the 21st king of the Joseon Dynasty, conducted the overhaul of the stream in earnest by dredging the stream, building stone banks and changing a waterway. Due to this construction, the curved waterway of the stream became straight one at last. During the reign of King Sunjo and King Kojong, the overhaul of the stream was continued. There were 24 bridges over the stream(now 22 bridges).

During the Japanese colonial period, it came to get called "Cheonggye" as it is called today, supposedly from 1914, when the colonialists rearranged stream names in Korea. In this perion, the large-scale dredging of this stream was planned in terms of a modern urban planning by Japan but it wasn't carried out because of lack of funds. Therefore, the urban improvement project was neglected. 

As a result, by Korea’s independence from Japan in 1945, the Cheonggyecheon was severely contaminated with wastes from flimsy shacks built alongside of the stream. It had a fetid smell as well. In terms of Seoul's appearance and sanitation, the then Cheonggyecheon was a serious problem. The easiest way of solving this promblem was covering over the stream with concrete. In 1958, finally, the work to cover it up with concrete started as quickly as possible by August 1958. In addition, a 5.6 km-long, 16 m-wide elevated highway was completed over the stream in August 1971 after four working years.

About 40 years after covering over the stream with concrete, Seoul city had resuscitated the stream since July 2003. After $ 386 milion recovery project, Cheonggyecheon was born again as a haven for wildlife as well as pedestrians in September 2005

The Blue Lias is a formation of rocks mostly in south west England and parts of south Wales. It is part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site.

It is part of the Lias Group. The Blue Lias consists of a sequence of limestone and shale layers. It was laid down in late Triassic and early Jurassic times, between 195 and 200 million years ago. The Blue Lias is famous for its fossils, especially ammonites. Also found were remains of a number of dinosaurs, and the pterosaur "Dimorphodon".

The Blue Lias alternates between limestone, (with some clay), and mudstone. These alternations are caused by short-term climatic variations, thought to be caused by Milankovitch cycles. The blue/grey colour is given by iron pyrite.

A bit higher, these limestone-mudstone alternations change into a clay member. The deposition of a clay-rich mudstone member shows it was laid down in a deeper marine environment.

Film processing

The film used in photography is able to record images. In order to make these images visible, the film needs to undergo a number of chemical processes. The result of these processes will either be negatives or slides. This is generally known as "developing". Different films need different processes. The process for black and white film is different from that for slide film. In general, the provess involves the following steps:
There are different kinds of films. The most common of these is negative film. With negative film, all colors are reversed. This is corrected in an additional step of making a "print" of each image. So called reversal film, which is used for diapositives directly produces "positive" images (which are "framed" to become a "diapositive"). 

This whole process is known as film processing.

Because they have been held in rocks for a long time they often contain chemicals that have come from the rocks. This chemicals can give the water an interesting taste. Some mineral waters may be good for health. Because some underground water comes to the surface from very deep layers in the earth, it can also have carbon dioxide gas dissolved in it. This can make the water fizzy.

Lotte Giants is a professional baseball team established in 1982. As we can see the name, the company Lotte supports this team and Lotte Giants are based on the cities Busan, Changwon Korea. They are one of the original franchises of the Korea Baseball Organization league. They have Sajik Baseball Stadium and Masan Baseball Stadium (Changwon Baseball Stadium now). They represent KyungNam province. So they don’t give up the game and show very exciting play style. Lotte Giants won the first place on 1984, 1992. With enthusiastic Busan residents, in 2008, 2009, 2010 Lotte Giants recode about 4 million spectators and that is the best record. The passionate spectators develop their unique cheer cultures. The symbol of this team is a gull which represents Busan where is a harbor place. “Passion” and “Endurance” are the values which Busan and Lotte Giants share.

With hot passon, there were great pitchers in Lotte Giants. In 1984, there was a pitcher Choi Dong-Won who won the 4 games in Korean Series. In 1992, there was Yeom Jong-Seok who was a rookie but the ace pitcher and Yoon Hak-Gil who was called "lonely prince" played very important role to win the first place. Also there were burning hitters like "Tank" Park Jeong-Tae, "Ma-Po" Ma Hae-Young, "Mr. Lotte" Kim Min-Ho. Lotte Giants were not the strong team but always threatened the high class teams with their enthusiasm.

After 90's, franchise stars got retired as times went by. Always they were the root of the team who kept the basement. But the rookie players were not prepared for the change of the generation. Also a manager Baek In-Cheon was posted and he was not the right person to run the team. So from the 2001 to 2004, Lotte Giants recoded the bottom place, making the people in Busan people unhappy. Lotte Giants recorded 8-8-8-8-5-7-7 and people from other team called "Ggoldae" which means Lotte is the bottom loser.

Suddenly a foreign manager came to Lotte Giants. His name is Jeron Kennis Royster simply "Jerry". His strategies was innovative and he gave courages to the players. With his efforts, he found out great players then he made Lotte Giants go into the Post Seasons. Fans named this "Royster Magic". From 2008 to 2010, Lotte Giants got advanced to the Post Seasons and made Busan people be happy.

For the enthusiastic fans, players tried to give back their thankfulness. But some players made some issues like driving a car after drinking alcohol or hit the person with his bat. And Lotte company has a little negative images among the fans. The fans should send their franchise stars almost without the farewell party. The Lotte company sometimes paid low-wages and it made the players depressed. Royster was fired in this year because he could not won the first place. The pro-baseball is a business but fans are also important factor of the team. And sometimes too enthusiastic fans made messy during the games so it should be controlled.

In 2000, suddenly a player collapsed near the 2B. His name is Im Soo-Hyuk. Due to the poor preparation, he could not receive proper first-aid then his brain got damaged. After that, he had stayed on the bed losing his consciousness. Include Lotte Giants players, many people volunteerily made a game or events for his medical expenses.

Halomonadaceae

GFAJ-1 is a strain of rod-shaped extremophile bacteria in the family Halomonadaceae. When it does not have any phosphorus, it takes the usually poisonous element arsenic as a substitute. 

Geomicrobiologist Felisa Wolfe-Simon collected lake-bottom sediments in the shallow (not deep) waters of Mono Lake in California. Wolfe-Simon cultured the arsenic-using organisms from this hypersaline (very salty) and highly alkaline environment.

Its discovery helps the idea that life on other planets may have, to some extent, a different chemical makeup from life on Earth.

Life is mostly composed of the elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus. Although these six elements make up nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids and thus the bulk of living matter, it is possible in theory that some other elements in the periodic table could serve the same functions.

Up until now, it was believed that all life needed phosphorus as a basic piece of the ‘backbone’ that holds DNA together. Likewise ATP (adenosine triphosphate), a key molecule in the cells' energy cycle.

The team has evidence that this bacterium can use arsenic instead of phosphorus in its DNA. Their paper will be published in the journal "Science" on December 8, 2010.

Sewage treatment

Sewage treatment is the process of dealing with sewage so that is does not cause harm to people or to rivers. Sewage flows in sewer from houses and factories. When it arrives at a sewage treatment works it passes through many stages. Larger works often have more stages than a smaller works.

First, large objects are removed using screens. The sewage then flows through a tank so that sand can fall out. If sand was not got rid of it would damage machines in the next stages. 

Large tanks the allow solids to settle to the bottom. Fat also floats to the top. Both fats and solids are removed. What is left is liquid which is sprinkled over deep tanks of rocks or pieces of plastic. The rocks or plastic have bacteria and other very small animals and plants growing on them. These bacteria use oxygen from the air to remove chemicals from the sewage. In some sewage treatment, sewage has air blown through it to create a thick brown mixture in which bacteria float in the mixture making the sewage more pure. 

The liquid at the end of this stage flows into another large tank and the bacteria and other solids settle to the bottom. The clean liquid on the top can then flow to a river or the sea but it may also need further treatment to make it cleaner. The bacteria that have settled to the bottom of the tank can be re-used to treat more sewage.

This process makes lots of solids and these can be used to make methane gas and fertiliser for farmers fields.

Jeju United FC

The Jeju United FC, founded in 1982, is a professional football team in the K-League. It uses Jeju Worldcup Stadium as its home stadium. Although it is based in Jeju at this moment, it has been through several base changes. Its original name was 'Yukong Kokkiri FC', which was founded in 1982 and based in Seoul, Incheon, and Kyunggi-do province. This YooGong football club changed its home stadium to Seoul in 1990. In 1996, as a part of localization policy, it again changed its home stadium to Bucheon, and changed its name as Bucheon SK. However, the overall facilities in Bucheon were not enough, so it finally changed its home stadium to Jeju Island, thus getting the name 'Jeju United FC.'

This football club is famous for educating coaches and for supporting the development of football techniques. For example, Valeri Nepomniachi, the Russian coach hired in 1994, delivered many developed strategies and techniques to the K-League. This created a vogue 'Nepomniachi Style' among other teams. Its mascot is Kamguri, which represents the symbol of Jeju, the Mandarin. Its home stadium, 'Jeju World Cup Stadium,' can accommodate 35,545 people.

Jeju United FC has been doing well in the K-league. It came in 3rd in the 1983 Superleague. Beginning from this, it has maintained good rankings in K-league including the championship in 1989. In this year (2010), it maintained first place throughout the season, but was surpassed by FC Seoul at the last match, ending in the second. 
The emblem of Jeju United FC is a shield-shaped one with the combination of black, red, and blue. This will enable people to feel the power of the football team. To be more specific, the emblem represents Hallasan and the horn of a deer which symbolize Jeju Island. This expresses the defense power of the team. At the same time, the sword in the middle which was made from the 'J' in Jeju Island involves the team's spirit that it will adopt the attacking-strategy as its main one. In addition to this, it uses the motif of SK group's Happy Wings so that the Jeju residents would become united through the soccer.

Jeju World Cup Stadium was built in harmony with Jeju's culture, nature, and life. First, the entrance was made after the traditional entrance, Olle. Also, Jeongnang, a traditional door, stands next to the entrance. The overall shape of the stadium resembles the so-called 'Oreum'. Oreum is a parasitic volcano, and its top has a concave shape. To attain this concave shape, the stadium made the field 14m under the ground, which minimized the effect of the wind. Besides, the roof of the stadium symbolizes Teu, the traditional boat for fishing. As a home stadium of Jeju United FC, it can accommodate more than 35.000 people.

The River Teifi is a river in west Wales. It starts in the hills above the town of Tregaron and then flows into a large marsh called Tregaron bog. This bog helps to stop flow in the river being too extreme. It stores up flood water when it is raining hard and it lets water go during dry weather.

The water in the River Teifi is very good quality. The river supports lots of wild-life including Salmon and Trout. The wildlife is so special that the whole river has been given special protetion by scientists to stop it being damaged.

The river passes through small towns such as Lampeter and Newcastle Emlyn before it reaches the sea at Cardigan. For the last few miles before it reaches Cardigan, the river runs through a deep gorge called Cigerran Gorge. Some people still fish for Salmon here using a very ancient boat called a Coracle.

These metals get into the river from old lead mines. Nobody uses the mines any more but the waste material left behind still has lots of metal in it and this dissolves in rain and gets into the river.

<doc id="273828" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=273828" title="Knut (polar bear)">
Knut (polar bear)

Knut (5 December 2006 19 March 2011) was a polar bear who was born in captivity at the Berlin Zoo. Because his mother rejected him when he was born, he was raised by zookeepers. People began to protest for him after a German newspaper called "Bild-Zeitung" quoted an animal rights activist saying the young cub had to die. Both children and adults supported him, and e-mails and letters asking the zoo to let the cub live were sent from around the world. Because of his fame, Knut became a tourist attraction and commercial success.

Knut became very popular and the center of mass media attention called "Knutmania". Many toys, DVDs, and books were made about him. This brought in lots of money, about five million euros, to Berlin Zoo in 2007. More people went to the zoo, and that year was the most profitable year in its 163-year history.

Knut was born at Berlin Zoo. His mother was Tosca, a 20-year-old polar bear. She was a circus performer from East Germany, born in Canada, and her 13-year-old mate, Lars, was from a park in Munich. Tosca gave birth to Knut and his unnamed brother on 5 December 2006. However, she left her cubs on a rock in the polar bear enclosure and did not take care of them. The zookeepers rescued the cubs with a fishing net, but Knut's brother died from sickness four days later. Knut was only the size of a guinea pig, and had to spend the first 44 days of his life in an incubator before zookeeper Thomas Dörflein began raising the cub.

Dörflein had to sleep on a mattress next to the cub at night because Knut needed care. Dörflein also had to play with, bathe, and feed the cub every day. Knut's food began with a bottle of baby milk mixed with cod liver oil every two hours. At four months old, he could eat milk porridge mixed with cat food and vitamins. Dörflein also appeared with Knut on the twice-daily one-hour shows at the zoo. Because of this, he appeared in lots of videos and photographs with the cub, and became well-known in Germany. He also won Berlin's Medal of Merit in honor of his hard work and care for Knut. Dörflein died of a heart attack on 22 September 2008.

In early March 2007, the German newspaper "Bild-Zeitung" quoted the animal rights activist Frank Albrecht, who said that Knut should be killed instead of humiliated by being raised in a zoo. He declared that the zoo was breaking the rules of animal protection by keeping him alive. Wolfram Graf-Rudolf, the director of the Aachen Zoo, agreed with Albrecht. He stated that the zookeepers "should have had the courage to let the bear die". A group of children protested at the zoo, holding up signs that read "Knut Must Live" and "We Love Knut". Others sent emails and letters asking for the cub's life to be spared. Threatening letters were also sent to Albrecht. Berlin Zoo agreed to support the baby polar bear, and promised not to harm him.

Albrecht later claimed that he had quoted this because he wanted to change the law, not to have the bear killed. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.

On 23 March 2007, Knut appeared in public for the first time. About 400 journalists visited Berlin Zoo on what was called "Knut Day" to make reports all over the world. Because Knut became famous when he was very young, many wrong stories about the cub's health were spread around during his first year. For example, on 16 April 2007, Knut took a break from his display because of teething pains, but reports said that he might have an unknown sickness. There were also many death threats, like the one sent on Wednesday 18 April 2007. The zoo received an anonymous letter by fax which said "Knut ist tot! Donnerstag Mittag." ("Knut is dead! Thursday noon.") The police increased the bear's security.

In November 2007, Knut weighed over 90 kg (198 lb) and became too dangerous to be cared for closely. Hundreds of children attended the cub's first birthday celebration. This party was also shown live on German television. The national mint also made 25,000 special silver coins for his birthday. When Flocke, a female polar bear, was born at the Nuremberg Zoo in December 2007, "Bild" named her Mrs. Knut, suggesting that the two German-born polar bears might become mates.

A year after his public debut, Knut was reported as weighing more than 130 kg (286 lb). Very strong six-inch glass was put up between him and the zoo visitors. At the end of March 2008, Markus Röbke, one of the zookeepers who helped raise Knut, said the bear should leave the zoo to help him get used to living alone. Röbke also said that Knut misses Thomas Dörflein, who was like a father to him, and that he cries when no one is near him. "Knut needs an audience," Röbke said. "That has to change".

In July 2008, it was announced that the Neumünster Zoo in northern Germany, which owns Knut's father, sued Berlin Zoo for the money that came from Knut's success. Neumünster had tried to be friendly with Berlin Zoo at first, but now was trying to use the court to make them give part of the money that came from Knut. Peter Drüwa, the zoo director at Neumünster, said that they "do not want to remove Knut from his environment, but we have a right to our request for money." Shortly before Knut's second birthday, there were reports being spread that the bear would have to move to another zoo because he was getting too large for his enclosure. However, the zoo said that they still wanted to keep Knut.

Giovanna, a female polar bear about the same age as Knut, went to Berlin from Munich's Hellabrunn Animal Garden in September 2009. She shared Knut's enclosure for a short time while her regular home had repairs. Her arrival interested people from all over the world, because many sources thought the two bears (although they were sexually immature) would soon be "dating". However, in March 2010, the German chapter of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) called for Giovanna to stay somewhere else. Knut and Giovanna share a grandfather, and PETA spokesperson Frank Albrecht thought the same person who had claimed that Knut should be killed would threaten the German polar bear population if they might breed. The Berlin Zoo did not respond, but noted that Giovanna's stay in Berlin was only for a short time. In August 2010, Giovanna was moved back to Munich after repairs to her enclosure were finished.

Knut died on 19 March 2011 because of a brain disease. He had encephalitis (irritation and swelling of the brain). The swelling was probably caused by a virus, and caused an epileptic fit. After death, the body of the bear was a subject of further study at the Berlin Museum of Natural History.

Berlin Zoo made Knut a trademark in late March 2007. As a result, its shares became even higher. Knut earned Berlin Zoo nearly €5 million that year.

Many companies made cuddly toys modeled from Knut. Steiff, a toy company, made Knut-based stuffed animals in three sizes and models: sitting, standing, and lying down. They all sold out at the Berlin Zoo in only four days. The money was used to improve the bear's home. Candy company Haribo sold a raspberry-flavored gummy bear sweet called Cuddly Knut beginning in April 2007. They promised to give ten cents to the zoo for every package of Knut sweets it sold. The gummy bears sold very quickly as well.

Knut has been the subject of several popular songs in Germany, such as the singles "Knut is Cute" and ""Knut, der kleine Eisbär"" () by nine-year-old Kitty. In Britain, musical comedian Mitch Benn has performed three songs about Knut for BBC Radio 4 satirical series "The Now Show": "The Baby Bear Must DIE!", "Knut Isn't Cute Anymore", and "Goodbye Knut"—"Goodbye Knut" was about Knut moving to the Neumünster Zoo. Knut has also been in several DVDs, including one titled "Knut—Stories from a Polar Bear's Nursery". He appeared on the 29 March 2007 cover of the German "Vanity Fair" magazine, which was about the bear's life.

On 1 May 2007 it was announced that New York-based Turtle Pond Publications and Berlin Zoo had signed a deal for the worldwide publishing rights to Knut with the hopes of raising global warming issues. Written by Craig Hatkoff and his daughters, the 44-page book entitled "Knut, der kleine Eisbärenjunge" ("Little Polar Bear Knut") is about Knut's life story as well as photographs. Although books about Knut had already been published in Germany, this book was the first to be authorized by the Berlin Zoo.

The book was published in Germany by Ravensburger on 26 July 2007. After that, the US publishing company Scholastic made an English version, "Knut: How one little polar bear captivated the world".
On 31 December 2007, the zoo's director said that the zoo had received a proposal for a film deal from Hollywood film producer Ash R. Shah, to make an animated film about the bear's life. Shah reportedly suggested a €3.5 million film deal to the zoo. The German film "Knut und seine Freunde" ("Knut and His Friends"), was shown in Berlin on 2 March 2008. Directed by Michael Johnson, the film was about how Knut was rescued after his mother did not take care of him.

Dr. Gerald Uhlich, of Berlin zoo, stated that Knut "draw[s] attention to the environment in a nice way." As a result, the German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel adopted Knut as the mascot for a conference about endangered species. Gabriel met with Knut soon after his zoo debut, and said that although Knut was safe, "worldwide polar bears are in danger and if Knut can help the cause, then that is a good thing."

Photographer Annie Leibovitz took pictures of Knut that were used for an environmental campaign. The polar bear has also been on the logo for the German Environment Minister's campaign to help stop global warming and a 2008 stamp. The stamp shows the roughly one-year-old Knut with the slogan "Natur weltweit bewahren" ("Preserve nature worldwide").

Cottage pie is a savory pie popular in the United Kingdom. It is a dish of minced meat with mashed potato on top.

The name "cottage pie" was first used at the end of the 18th century. It was around that time that the poorer people of Great Britain, people who lived in cottages in the country, started using potatoes as an everyday food. Originally, a pie made with any kind of meat and mashed potato was called a "cottage pie". In modern British English, the dish is usually called "cottage pie" if it is made with beef. If it is made with lamb it is usually called shepherd's pie.

A light beam or beam of light is a small projection of light energy coming from a source into a beam. Sunlight is a natural example of a light beam when it crosses through various objects (clouds, foliage, windows, etc). To produce fake light, a lamp and a parabolic reflector is used in many lighting devices such as spotlights, car headlights. Light from certain types of lasers has the smallest possible beam width, so it produces the most parallel light beams possible.

Freshwater biology is the study of plants and animals that live in freshwater. This includes rivers, lakes , ponds , marshes and other bodies of water. It is part of the branch of science called Limnology.

Much freshwater biology takes place in man-made places such as sewage treatment works and water treatment works. In these places water is purified using plants and animals. Keeping them work as hard as possible helps to make the water as clean as possible.

In recent times freshwater biologists have been looking at how plants and animals change in the autumn and spring. This is helping us to understand more about the effects of climate change.

Tincture of iodine

Tincture of iodine is a disinfectant. It has iodine and potassium iodide dissolved in ethanol and water. Normally, iodine does not dissolve in water. But when iodide is added, the iodine can dissolve. Also, ethanol helps iodine dissolve. Tincture of iodine has about equal amounts of iodide and iodine. There are two types of tincture of iodine:

USP Tincture of Iodine: for every 100 mL, it has 1.8 to 2.2 grams of iodine, 2.1 to 2.6 grams of sodium iodide, and 50mL ethanol. The rest is water.

USP Strong Iodine Tincture: for every 100 mL, it has 6.8 to 7.5 grams of iodine, 4.7 to 5.5 grams of potassium iodide, and 50 mL ethanol. The rest is water.

It can be used as a skin disinfectant and as a water disinfectant. Because it has iodine in it, it is toxic in large amounts. Lugol's iodine is an alcohol-free version. It is commonly used in experiments in middle school science labs.

<doc id="273932" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=273932" title="Halophile">
Halophile

Halophiles are organisms that require salt in their environment to live. Halophiles live in evaporation ponds or salt lakes such as Great Salt Lake, Owens Lake, or Dead Sea. The name "halophile" comes from Greek for "salt-loving". 

Whereas most halophiles are categorized within the Archaea domain, certain bacteria and eukaryotes are also halophiles, such as the alga "Dunaliella salina". 

Most halophilic and all salt tolerant organisms use energy to remove salt from their cytoplasm. Normally, organisms living around a lot of salt would lose water and die because of osmosis. Water inside the organism would move from inside the cell to its outside environment. This is because there is always movement of water to reach a state where the concentrations of salt are the same on both sides of the cell membrane.

To survive, the cytoplasm of halophiles must be isotonic with its environment. To get to this state, halophiles use two different methods. In the first (mainly used by bacteria, some archaea, yeasts, algae and fungi), organic compounds are stored in the cytoplasm. These compounds help the organism survive stress of osmosis. The most commonly used solutes for this process are neutral and include amino acids and sugars. Advantages to this method are that organisms could live in a wider range of salt concentrations than in the adaption below. Also, the proteins not exposed to high salt levels do not have to adapt to high salt levels. An important disadvantage to this method is that it requires the organism to use much more energy then the adaption below. 

The second, less common adaptation, involves the selective intake of potassium (K) ions into the cytoplasm. In exchange, the organism pumps sodium (Na) ions out with the help of the sodium-potassium pump. Ions of sodium may be used instead of potassium, but potassium is the most common. This adaptation is only used by one order of bacteria and one family of Archaea. An advantage to this method is that it uses much less energy than the adaption above. The main disadvantage to this adaption is that all of the machinery inside the cell (enzymes, structural proteins, etc.) must be adapted to high levels of non-organic ions and high salt levels. This is much more demanding than the compatible solute adaptation described above.

Most halophilic organisms only use one of the two methods, but a few halophiles can use both.

Halophiles are categorized by the levels of salt at which they grow best. Halophiles can either be categorized as slight halophiles, moderate halophiles, or extreme halophiles. Slight halophiles grow best in concentrations of salt around 2% to 5%. An example of a slight halophile is "Erythrobacter flavus". Slight halophiles live in mud on the ocean floor, in seawater, and in garden soil.

Moderate halophiles grow best in concentrations of salt around 5% to 20%. Examples of moderate halophiles are organisms in the genera "Desulfovibrio", "Desulfocella", "Desulfohalobium", and "Desulfotomaculum". Moderate halophiles live in marine salterns, saline lakes, in matter at the bottom of the sea, and in oil brine fields.

Extreme halophiles grow best in concentrations of salt from 20% to 30%. Examples of extreme halophiles are "Salinibacter ruber" and organisms in the Halobacteria class. Extreme halophiles live in the Dead Sea in the Middle East and in man-made solar salterns (lakes used for making sea salt).

Halophiles play an important part in ecosystems. For example, halophiles often support entire populations of wild birds. 

Halophiles are useful for cleaning up polluted environments. Waste water with salt concentrations more than 2% is ideal for halophiles to remove organic pollutants from. For instance, halophiles have been shown to remove phenol (a poisonous chemical) from their environments. This could lead to future use in cleaning up oil spills.

Halophiles play an important part in the fermentation of some foods. For instance, halophiles ferment soy and fish sauces. Halophiles also ferment salted fish.

Halophilic microorganisms are useful in biotechnology. The compounds that certain halophiles make are valuable. Some of these compounds are not found anywhere else in the living world. The salt-tolerant enzymes that halophiles produce can be used in a variety of ways. For example, these enzymes could be used for rough industrial processes, like food processing.

Some moderate halophiles produce sugars outside the cell. These sugars can be used as thickeners and emulsifiers in the petroleum and medicine industries.

Dunaliella salina is a type of halophile pink micro-algae found in sea salt fields. "Dunaliella salina" is used in cosmetics and dietary supplements. Few organisms can survive in such highly saline conditions as salt evaporation ponds. To survive, these organisms have high concentrations of beta-carotene to protect against light, and high concentrations of glycerol to provide protection against osmotic pressure. This offers an opportunity for commercial biological production of these substances.

Scarification

Scarification or cicatrization is a form of body modification, where a design or pattern is cut, etched or scratched into human skin to make a permanent scar. Like with most body modification, there are many reasons why people choose to be scarified. The act of scarifying has been compared to tattooing due to the fact that it permanently changes the skin. It has also been identified with self harm because people have used it to cover self-inflicted wounds. 

Scarification began as cultural identification in some places, especially in Maori and African societies. . Other cultures may use it for religious reasons, and nearly all cultures use it for aesthetics. Some people also use scarification for pleasure, as the process of being scarified creates endorphins.

Cowbirds are birds of the genus "Molothrus". They are brood parasites, similar in life-style to the Cuckoo. The entire family Icteridae is limited to the New World.

They lay their eggs in the nests of other birds. The birds whose nest is used by the cowbird is tricked into raising the young cowbirds.

These birds feed on insects, including those stirred up by cattle. They lay their eggs in other birds' nests. This means that the birds can more easily stay with the herd.

The Brown-headed Cowbird has over 220 hosts. The other cowbird species have fewer known hosts, but all the species are generalists when it comes to choosing a host. This means that the eggs may look different from the hosts' eggs.

Elisabeth of Bavaria

Duchess Elisabeth of Bavaria (December 24, 1837 - September 10, 1898) was the wife of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria.

Born in Munich, Bavaria, into the royal family of Wittelsbach, she was the fourth of ten children of Prince Maximilian of Bavaria and his wife Princess Ludovika. Known as "Sissi", she grew up in a warm and convivial family atmosphere with her brothers and sisters at Possenhofen Castle. In August 1853, she went to Bad Ischl with her mother and older sister Helene, to celebrate Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph's 23rd birthday. The event was also supposed to be the occasion to announce his engagement to Helene, but Franz Joseph was so taken by the young and beautiful Elisabeth that he proposed to her instead. 

They were married in great pomp in Vienna on April 24, 1854. The couple had four children; Sophie (1855-1857), Gisele (1856-1932), Rudolf (1858-1889) and Valerie (1868-1924). Franz Joseph and Elisabeth became King and Queen of Hungary in 1867, when the two country joined together and created the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 

Suffering from lung disease and melancholia, and disliking the strict etiquette of the court, Empress Elisabeth was often away and lived long period of time abroad, notably at her villa in Corfu. 

Her only son, Rudolf, committed suicide in 1889, after killing his young mistress Marie Vetsera. Empress Elisabeth was assassinated by an Italian anarchist in 1898, while on a visit to Geneva. 

She has since become something of an historical icon and highly romantic figure, through a serie of films called "Sissi" in the 1950s, featuring actress Romy Schneider.

Arthur Howey "Art" Ross (January 13, 1886 – August 5, 1964) was a Canadian ice hockey defenceman and executive from 1905 until 1954. Thought of as one of the best defenders of his time by his peers, he was one of the first to skate with the puck up the ice instead of passing it to a forward. He won the Stanley Cup twice in a playing career that lasted thirteen seasons; in January 1907 with the Kenora Thistles and 1908 with the Montreal Wanderers. Like other players of the time, Ross played for many teams and leagues, and is most familiar for when he played with the Wanderers while they were members of the National Hockey Association (NHA) and its successor, the National Hockey League (NHL). In 1911 he led one of the first player strikes over the players wanting more money. When the Wanderers' home arena burned down in January 1918, the team stopped playing so Ross retired as a player.

After working as an on-ice official for a few years, he became head coach of the Hamilton Tigers for one season. When the Boston Bruins were created in 1924, Ross was hired as the first coach and general manager of the team. He would go on to coach the team four different times until 1945 and stayed as general manager until his retirement in 1954. Ross helped the Bruins finish first place in the league ten times and to win the Stanley Cup three times; Ross coached the team to one of the Stanley Cup victories. After he was hired by the Bruins, Ross, along with his wife and two sons, moved to a city near Boston, and became an American citizen in 1938. He died near Boston in 1964.

Ross was also important in creating different inventions for hockey to make it better. He created a style of hockey puck still used today, and also created an improved style of goal nets, which were used for forty years. In 1947 Ross gave the NHL the Art Ross Trophy, which is given to the best scorer of the NHL regular season. When the Hockey Hall of Fame was created in 1945, Ross was one of the first twelve players named there.

The Proteobacteria are a major phylum of bacteria. 

They are Gram-negative bacteria. This means they do not retain the violet dye in the Gram staining protocol. 

In a Gram stain test, a counterstain (commonly safranin) is added after the crystal violet, colouring all Gram-negative bacteria with a pink colour. 

The test itself is useful in classifying two distinct types of bacteria based on the structural differences of their cell walls.

Proteobacteria include a wide variety of pathogens, such as "Escherichia coli", "Salmonella", "Vibrio", "Helicobacter", and many other notable genera. 

Others are free-living, and include many of the bacteria responsible for nitrogen fixation. The group is defined primarily in terms of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences.

Most members are facultatively or obligately anaerobic, chemoautotrophs, and heterotrophic, but there are numerous exceptions.

There are alphaproteobacteria in this phylum which are widely found in marine plankton. They may constitute over 10% of the open ocean microbial community.

André Kim

André Kim (August 24, 1935 – August 12, 2010) was a South Korean fashion designer based in Seoul, South Korea. He was known mainly for his evening and wedding gown collections.
André Kim, whose real name is Kim Bong Nam, is one of fashion designers in South Korea. He has made a lot of achievements in not only Korean fashion but also International fashion, so even New York Times and Herald Tribune in London described him as 'A pioneer in Korean fashion' and 'Alive fashion hero'. His personal life was hidden in secrecy except for the fact that he adopted a son.
The modifier 'The first' always follows his name. This is because, Kim became the Korea’s first male fashion designer as he opened his fashion shop in 1962 and since that time he attracted public attention by designing a wedding dress of Um Aeng Ran who was a top star at that time and designing many clothes like uniforms of the Korean athletes for the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games. Furthermore, not only did he hold a fashion show in Paris as the first South Korean in 1966 but also he held a lot of fashion shows in many countries such as New York, Washington DC, Beijing and Sydney. Also, he was in the spotlight of world because he became the world's first fashion designer to hold a fashion show in front of pyramids and Angkor Wat temple, which is regarded as impossible before. 
There are many characteristics that only André Kim has in his fashion shows and styles. One of them is wedding finale, which is representative symbol as a bride and groom wearing wedding gowns confront each other. Another feature is his fashion style. Kim sticks to a design which emphasizes woman's elegance and tries to apply Korean traditional pattern. Moreover, he always emphasizes white color. To be specific, the clothes that he designed is white as well as the things that he uses, such as furniture and cars, are also white. Moreover, he wears only white clothes regardless of the situation, even when he sleeps and takes a rest.
According to article that he interviewed with, the reasons why he loves white color are as follows. 
""Since I was young, I really love snow so naturally I love a white, which is the color of snow. Also, I think that white represents purity. I can feel emotional purity by the white color and get relaxed whenever I wear white clothes.""
Since 2002 Kim has expanded his business into not only design field such as children's wear and golf coat but also various fields like cosmetics and jewelry. He was active in his work even before he passed away on August 12, 2010 because of the pneumonia and colorectal cancer at age 74. His death is considered a loss of a Korean fashion icon.

Wensleydale

Wensleydale is the valley (dale) of the River Ure on the east side of the Pennines in North Yorkshire, England. Wensleydale is in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It is named after the small village of Wensley. The village name 'Wensley' comes from the words "Woden's ley", or meadow of the pagan god Woden. It is famous for its cheese.

Wensleydale cheese is made from cow's milk. It is produced in a village in the county of North Yorkshire in England. It is usually shaped into a flat disc known as a truckle. The history of the cheese began in Wensleydale in 1150 when monks started making cheese. This became a farmhouse industry until the first commercial cheese was made in Hawes in 1897. Cheese making continued until May 1992 when the cheese factory closed. Six months later a group of local businessmen, ex-factory workers and cheesemakers, were able to reopen the business and promote Real Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese. This business has become very successful making specialty cheese and now employs more than 200 people.

In the 1990s, sales of the cheese had fallen very low. However, in the popular Wallace and Gromit animated cartoons, "A Grand Day Out" and "A Close Shave" the main character Wallace, a cheese lover, mention Wensleydale as a particularly favourite cheese, which boosted sales of the cheese.

Mistaken Point Ecological Reserve

Mistaken Point Ecological Reserve is one of the world's greatest fossil sites. It is part of Newfoundland and Labrador, in Canada.

Mistaken Point was so named because sailors found it a navigational hazard on the foggy tip of Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula. The site is on Canada's Tentative List for proposed UNESCO World Heritage Sites. No-one can visit the fossil site without an official guide; collecting actual fossils may not be done.

The fossils are in Mistaken Point's tilted and faulted mudstone and sandstone. They are exposed, visible on the surface. They are part of the Ediacaran biota, the oldest complex (multicellular) life forms. The Ediacaran is the last period in the Proterozoic eon. They date to 575 to 542 million years ago, when all life was in the sea.

The Reserve is the only place in the world where you can see a 565-million-year-old sea floor which preserves the ecology of these ancient deep sea communities.

This lagerstätte includes over 30 types of ancient creatures, most of them extinct groups unknown in our modern world.

The creatures lived on the bottom of a deep ocean, below the depths that light could reach. What is now Newfoundland was then between latitudes 40°–65° South. 

The imprints of the soft-bodied animals were preserved in place on the muddy sea floor when they were suddenly buried by repeated volcanic ash-falls. The ash (tuff) layers contain zircon, which makes it possible for geologists to accurately date the fossil layers by radiometric dating. Fossils of similar age are found in Russia and Australia, but the variety found at Mistaken Point make the site unique.

Incheon

Incheon (officially, Incheon Metropolitan City) is a major port city in South Korea and famous for Incheon International Airport.

Incheon is located 28 km from the nation’s capital, Seoul, Incheon lies at 126° 37´ east longitude and 37° 28´ north latitude, the same latitude as San Francisco, Washington, Madrid, and Teheran. Incheon is the third largest city in South Korea, after Seoul and Busan and 2.6 million people lives in Incheon (2009).

There are ten administrative districts in Incheon and it is divided into 8 wards ("gu") and 2 counties ("gun").

Incheon Subway and Seoul Metropolitan Subway is linked (line number 1) and it takes approximately an hour from Incheon subway station to Seoul Station. 

The history of Incheon started from Goguryeo Kingdom in 475 AD, under the reign of King Jangsu. It's original name was Michuhol and it changed several times and renamed to Incheon-gun in the 13th year of King Taejong’s reign during Joseon period. In 1949, after Korea`s 1945 liberation, Incheon City reorganized and Incheon City finally renamed to Incheon Metropolitan City in 1995. 

During the Korea War, there was the battle of Incheon led by an American general of UN Douglas MacArthur and the battle resulted in a decisive victory and strategic reversal in favor of the United Nations(UN). In a show of gratitude to the American soldier, Koreans in the late 1950s erected the bronze statue of MacArthur in a central park at Incheon that overlooks the sea area through which his troops came ashore.

Incheon International Airport, Incheon Port, Songdo International City, Incheon Subway, and Munhak Worldcup Stadium are five major cites of Incheon.

Ganghwa-county (Ganghwa Island) is famous for dolmens registered as one of the World Heritages by UNESCO.
Hwamunseok mats are Incheon's famous local products, a figured mat. The beauty of these hand-woven mats has made them one of the most famous specialty products of Ganghwa-gun, and one of the most beloved traditional Korean crafts.

Wolmido was once a military base of Japanese Army during the Japanese colonial period and a outpost of the battle of Incheon. However, Wolmido is one of the most famous tourist spots near the Metropolitan area nowdays. Along the 1km-long Wolmido Street of Culture, there are lots of beautiful cafes and restaurants. Wolmido is also famous for street performers, portrait artists and Wolmi Festival. 

To become an international economic hub and a center of business and service industry of Asia, Incheon is developing free economic zone in the three regions of Songdo, Cheongra, and the island of Yeongjong. Incheon's Free Economic Zone, the first in Korea, was officially designated by the Korean government in August 2003 and it is planing to 2020.

James Gaye Stewart (June 28, 1923 - November 18, 2010) was a professional ice hockey forward. He played nine seasons as a left winger in the National Hockey League.

Born in Fort William, Ontario, Stewart was promoted from the minors in 1942 to play in one game of the Stanley Cup Finals, where he helped the Toronto Maple Leafs win the championship. The next season, Stewart won the 1943 Calder Trophy, beating out Maurice 'The Rocket' Richard of the Montreal Canadiens. He became the first player to win the Stanley Cup before the Calder. Danny Grant, Tony Esposito and Ken Dryden have accomplished it as well since then. 

After spending two years in the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II, Stewart returned to the NHL in 1945 and had his best season, leading the league with 37 goals - the last time a Leaf led the League in scoring. Stewart won his second Stanley Cup, again with the Maple Leafs, in 1947. Toronto traded Stewart to Chicago early in the 1947-48 season in a deal that brought Max Bentley to the Leafs, and he had three 20-goal seasons for the Black Hawks before finishing his career with stints in Detroit, New York and Montreal. In all, Gaye Stewart played for five of the NHL's Original Six teams, all except the Boston Bruins. He played 502 career NHL games, scoring 185 goals and 159 assists for 344 points. Stewart died on November 18, 2010, in a hospital in Burlington, Ontario, at the age of 87.

<doc id="274077" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=274077" title="Metric time">
Metric time

Metric time is a way of measuring how long a period of time is using the metric system. The metric system uses the second as a main unit of time. There are periods of time that are based on the second but shorter. They are named with metric prefixes. Some of these are kiloseconds and milliseconds. Other units of time, like the minute, hour, and day, are accepted for use with the modern metric system, but are not part of it.

The metric system was first used in France in 1795. It had units for length, area, dry volume, liquid capacity, weight or mass, and even amounts of money, but not for time. Decimal time of day had been first used in France two years earlier, but was set aside at the same time the metric system was started, and did not follow the metric pattern of a base unit and prefixed units. James Clerk Maxwell and Elihu Thomson (through the British Association for the Advancement of Science - BAAS) came up with the Centimetre gram second system of units (cgs) in 1874.
The ephemeris second (1/86400 of a mean solar day) was made one of the original base units of the modern metric system, or International System of Units (SI), at the 10th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 1954. The SI second was later made even more exact. It was made into the time of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation from the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.

People have had ideas for other base units of metric time (other than the second). On March 28, 1794, Joseph Louis Lagrange, the president of the commission which developed the metric system, wrote a report to the commission. His report suggested the names "déci-jour" and "centi-jour" (deciday and centiday in English). Base units that are decimal divisions of the day, such as 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000, or 1/100,000 day, or other divisions of the day, such as 1/20 or 1/40 day, have also been suggested, with names such as tick, meck, chi, chron, moment, etc. These other units have not caught on with people, however.

In computing, metric time became widely used because it is easy to use with computers. Unix time gives date and time as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, and Microsoft's FILETIME as multiples of 100ns since January 1, 1601. VAX/VMS uses the number of 100ns since November 17, 1858 and RISC OS the number of centiseconds since January 1, 1900. (Each of these is not exactly linear, as there are some interruptions with leap seconds.)

The main problem with metric time is in the units. The International System of Units has only come up with prefixes for 10 units exponentially in both the multiple and submultiple directions. The first three multiples would be viable for use within a metric time system; they are 10 (decasecond = 10 seconds), 10 (hectosecond = 100 seconds; 1.666 minutes) and 10 (kilosecond = 1 000 seconds; 16.666 minutes) respectively. However, the fourth value in the SI Units is 10 (megasecond = 1 000 000 seconds; 16 666.666 minutes; 277.777 hours; 11.574 days). Followed by 10 (gigasecond = 1 000 000 000 seconds; 16 666 666.666 minutes; 277 777.777 hours; 11 574.074 days; 31.689 years); a relatively nonviable unit with which to measure human time/life. To make this system of prefixes work for metric time, standard units and prefixes would have to be made for the 4th and 5th exponents to make metric time work for talking about time of human life. These would be:
10 seconds (10 000 seconds; 166.6 minutes; 2.777 hours)
10 seconds (100 000 seconds; 1 666.6 minutes; 27.77 hours; 1.157 days)

Chondrostei

The Chondrostei are a sub-class of ray-finned fish, the Actinopterygii. They include the sturgeons, huge fish which provide caviar.

The Chondrostei are mainly cartilaginous fish with some ossification. There are 52 species divided among two orders. The orders are the Acipenseriformes (sturgeons and paddlefishes), and the Polypteriformes (reedfishes and bichirs). 

This group has at times been classified with the sharks: the similarities are obvious, not only do the chondrosteans mostly lack bone, the structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than other bony fish. Both lack scales (except the Polypteriforms). Additional shared features include spiracles and, in sturgeons, a heterocercal tail (the vertebrae extend into the larger lobe of the caudal fin). However the fossil record suggests that these fish have more in common with the Teleostei than their external appearance might suggest.

It is thought that the ancestors of the chondrosteans were bony fish but that this characteristic was lost in later evolutionary development, resulting in a lightening of the frame. Elderly chondrosteans show beginnings of ossification of the skeleton which suggests that this process is delayed rather than lost in these fish.

In the early Mesozoic, a number of fish families were beginning to develop adaptations which would make them lighter, faster and more efficient predators. Chondrosteans took a radical approach. Cartilage is lighter than bone, and they delayed the development of bone, so that it only developed in elderly fish. They lost the upper jaw bones completely. Other changes allowed them to shoot the jaw forwards to grab prey.

Why did Chondrosteans react with such total reorganization? Obviously selection pressure must have been very strong. However, in one way they were almost unique. Rarely amongst animals, they underwent polyploidy, several times. Instead of two sets of chromosomes (diploid), the Chondrosteans have 8 or 16 sets of chromosomes. Such a dramatic genetic change may have given the potential for a rapid, drastic reorganization of the body plan.

He was 72 years old. Meredith was a quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys from 1960-1968. In 1970 he became a television broadcaster when he joined the Monday Night Football crew.
Meredith studied at Southern Methodist University (SMU). He played quarterback for SMU for three years. He was selected as an All-America in 1958 and 1959. In 1960, he was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the third round. He was then traded to the Dallas Cowboys for future draft picks. In 1960, the Cowboys were a newly formed "expansion" team.

Meredith played quarterback for the Cowboys from 1960 to 1968. In 1965, he became the starting quarterback. In 1966, he led the Cowboys to their first winning season, with a record of ten wins, three losses, and one tie. He threw a career-high 2,805 yards and 24 touchdown passes. He was named NFL Player of the Year and selected to the Pro Bowl. He led the Cowboys to three division titles. He played in the 1966 and 1967 NFL Championship games.

"Dandy Don" announced his retirement in 1969, the same day that Roger Staubach was released from the Navy. Staubach then replaced Meredith as the quarterback. Meredith was 31 years old and in the prime of his career.

Meredith was inducted to Cowboys "Ring of Honor" in 1976. He and Don Perkins were the second and third players added to the ring.
Don Meredith was one of the first athletes to move into television broadcasting as a color commentator. He joined Keith Jackson and Howard Cosell at Monday Night Football (MNF) in 1970. In 1973, he left MNF to join NBC for three years. In 1977, he returned to MNF until his retirement in 1984.

Lifeboat

A lifeboat, also known as a liferaft, is a small, stiff or inflatable boat carried for emergencies in the event of a disaster on a ship. Lifeboats are required by law to be on larger ships.

At the beginning of the 20th century larger ships meant that more people could travel but rules about lifeboats were often overlooked. After the Titanic sunk on April 15, 1912, people realized that more lifeboats were needed on larger ships. The Titanic's lifeboats were only capable of carrying 1,178 people although the number of passengers on the Titanic were 3,330 people.

Because many lifeboats were needed on the decks of passenger ships this led to the use of most of the deck space being used for lifeboats which created the problem of narrow passageways. This was fixed by inflatable lifeboats being used.

Overpopulation

Overpopulation means that there are too many organisms of a certain species in a certain habitat. This means that the number of organisms living there is larger than the carrying capacity of the habitat. The habitat cannot support these numbers over time without hurting itself.

The term "overpopulation" is most often used to refer to the number of humans living on Earth.

The world's population has greatly increased in the last 50 years, mainly due to medical advances and agricultural productivity. Steve Jones, head of the biology department at University College London, has said, 

The recent rapid increase in human population over the past two centuries has raised concerns that humans are beginning to overpopulate the Earth. The planet may not be able to sustain larger numbers of people. The population has been growing since the end of the Black Death, around the year 1400. At the beginning of the 19th century, it had reached roughly 1,000,000,000 (one billion). The industrial revolution and green revolutions led to rapid population growth all over the world. By 1960, the world population had reached 3 billion, and it doubled to 6 billion over the next four decades. As of 2011, the estimated annual growth rate was 1.10%, down from a peak of 2.2% in 1963, and the world population stood at roughly 6.9 billion. 

Current projections show a steady decline in the population growth rate, with the population expected to reach between 8 and 10.5 billion between the year 2040 and 2050.

The scientific consensus is that the present population growth and increase in use of resources is a threat to the ecosystem. The InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth called the growth in human numbers "unprecedented", and stated that many environmental problems, such as rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, global warming, and pollution, were made worse by the population expansion. At the time, the world population stood at 5.5 billion, and optimistic scenarios predicted a peak of 7.8 billion by 2050, a number that current estimates show will be reached around 2030.

The solutions usually suggested are better education and widespread free contraception (birth control). Many pregnancies are unplanned (40%) or unwanted. 

There are powerful forces working against birth control. Religious and traditional beliefs often favour large families. Few governments have tackled the problem seriously.

Bismuth(III) iodide, also known as bismuth triiodide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is BiI. It has bismuth and iodide ions in it. The bismuth is in its +3 oxidation state.

Bismuth(III) iodide is a dark gray solid. It is sometimes pale yellow, though. It does not dissolve in water. It reacts with other iodides to make iodobismuth(III) ions, BiI.

It is made by reacting bismuth powder with iodine. It is also made by reacting bismuth(III) oxide with hydroiodic acid. It can also be made by reacting bismuth(III) chloride with any iodide such as potassium iodide.

It was used in a test for bismuth ions. Bismuth ions form a dark gray precipitate when reacted with potassium iodide because bismuth(III) iodide was made.

Bismuth(III) oxide

Bismuth(III) oxide, also known as bismite and bismuth trioxide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is BiO. It has bismuth and oxide ions in it. The bismuth is in its +3 oxidation state.

Bismuth(III) oxide is a pale yellow solid. It does not dissolve in water. It dissolves in acids to make other bismuth(III) salts. When it is electrolyzed, it makes a bright red solid, bismuth(V) oxide. It has several different crystal structures that have been studied. It reacts with rare earth metal oxides and the products are being studied.

Bismite is the mineral form of bismuth(III) oxide. It is an ore of bismuth. Its Mohs hardness is 4.5 to 5 and its specific gravity is quite high, around 8 or 9. It is made when bismuthinite is oxidized. It was first found in Nevada in 1868.

It can be made by reacting sodium hydroxide with a bismuth(III) salt such as bismuth(III) chloride. It can also be made by igniting powdered bismuth metal. Another way of making it is to react bismuth nitrate (made by dissolving bismuth in nitric acid) with concentrated sodium hydroxide.

Bismuth(III) oxide is used in pyrotechnics to make fireworks that burn with an effect called "dragon's eggs". Lead(II,IV) oxide was used for this in the past, but now is considered too toxic to use. It is also used in research and the making of other bismuth compounds.

Pharmacoepidemiology

Pharmacoepidemiology studies the use and effects of drugs on large groups of people and patients. It assesses probability of beneficial and adverse effects, and risks for humans while using a particular drug. 

Pharmacoepidemiology bridges pharmacology and epidemiology and borrows their methodology from both of them. It uses descriptive epidemiological method by describing exposure to a drug and by calculating rates, e.g., incidence and prevalence. Such descriptive method generates hypothesis about influence of the drug, but does not test it. Pharmacoepidemiology also uses analytic epidemiological method by means of observation (case-control and cohort studies) and experimentation (clinical trial). The analytic study compares an exposed group with a control group and serves as testing of the hypothesis. 

Pharmacoepidemiology provides pharmacovigilance, the later is a type of continual monitoring of unwanted effects and other safety-related aspects of drugs in current growing integrating markets. Pharmacovigilance is conducted by spontaneous reporting systems through health care professionals and others which report adverse drug reactions to the central agency. The central agency combines reports from many sources to produce a more informative profile for drug products.

Carrying capacity

In biology, the carrying capacity of an environment is the number of organisms that can live there without harming the environment. If too many organisms live in an environment, it is called overpopulation.

The carrying capacity of an environment can change, and humans can have an effect on the carrying capacity. Some things that can change an environment's carrying capacity are pollution and the use of natural resources.

Defenestration

Defenestration is the action of throwing someone or something out of a window. The word comes from the Latin "de-" (down or away from) and "fenestra" (window or opening).

The word comes from two events in history, which both took place in Prague. In 1419, seven town officials were thrown from the Town Hall, starting the Hussite War. In 1618, two Imperial governors and their secretary were thrown from Prague Castle, which started the Thirty Years War. These two event, particularly in 1618, were called the Defenestration of Prague and gave rise to the word and the idea.

The phylum Aquificae is a diverse collection of bacteria that live in harsh environmental settings. They have been found in hot springs, sulfur pools, and thermal ocean vents. Members of the genus Aquifex, for example, are productive in water between 85 to 95 °C. They are the dominant members of most terrestrial neutral to alkaline hot springs above 60 degrees celsius. They are autotrophs, and are the primary carbon fixers in these environments. They are true bacteria (domain bacteria) as opposed to the other inhabitants of extreme environments, the Archaea.

Chloroflexi

Chloroflexi is one of four classes of bacteria that produce energy from light and are named for their green pigment, usually found in photosynthetic bodies. 

Chloroflexi are typically filamentous (they look like microscopic strings), and can move about through bacterial gliding. They are facultatively aerobic (they can survive with oxygen or without it), but do not produce oxygen in the process of producing energy from light, or phototrophy. Additionally Chloroflexi have a different method of phototrophy (photoheterotrophy) than true photosynthetic bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis (looking at DNA) indicates that they had a separate origin.

AKB48

AKB48 is a Japanese idol group. AKB48 is a newly formed idol group produced by Yasushi Akimoto. He searched Akihabara to find members who are innovative, because the area has been energetic recently. They are very popular in Japan.

The team deputed in January 2009. There are 47 members in total. They have a specific stage/theater called "AKB48 theater" (Japanese:AKB48劇場) in Akihabara, and perform there everyday. The reason for this is because Akimoto wanted to change the idea of idols. Idols usually are presented in an unrealistic way in the media, so Akimoto's idea was to show idols as real people whom fans could interact with.

"AKB" is a short form for Akihabara. During the first phase of this project, the name "Akihabara 48" was decided. It is popularly thought that the number 48 means the number of members, but instead it refers to the name of the group's President's office; "office48". The office is located in Chiba Prefecture, and in Japanese pronunciation, "Chiba" and "48" sound similar.

AKB48 consists of 3 teams called "Team A", "Team K", and "Team B". All members belong to one of these teams. Each team holds individual performances at their stage/theatre "AKB gekijou". Each team has 16 members.

Due to the large number of members, only a few members are picked by their producer when making media appearances. The members picked are called "senbatsu members". Senbatsu members have "earned" the privilege of representing the group during media appearances, and are usually decided by election.

There are two big election to decide who sing new song. We can get election post paper When we buy specific CDs or related goods to AKB48.

It is a latest elction of AKB48 from May 25th to June 8th 2010. Top 21 in this election can get the right to sing 17th single CD "Heavy Routation". Top 12 called "Media Senbatsu". They can promote new information on media.

Thermoregulation

Thermoregulation is the ability of an organism to keep its body temperature within certain boundaries, even when the surrounding temperature is very different. This process is one aspect of homeostasis: the keeping of a constant internal environment. If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal, a condition known as hyperthermia occurs. This occurs when the body is exposed to temperatures of approximately 55° C; any exposure longer than a few hours at this temperature or up to around 70° C kills. The opposite condition, when body temperature decreases below normal levels, is known as hypothermia.

<doc id="274287" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=274287" title="Auto-Tune">
Auto-Tune

Auto-Tune is a proprietary audio processor made by Antares Audio Technologies. Auto-Tune uses a phase vocoder to fix pitch in vocal and instrumental performances. It is used to hide out of tune singing and mistakes. It lets singers perform perfectly tuned vocal tracks without needing to sing in tune. Its main purpose is to slightly bend sung pitches to the nearest true semitone. Auto-Tune can also be used as an effect to distort the human voice when pitch is raised/lowered a lot.

Auto-Tune can be used as a plug-in for professional audio multi-tracking suites used in a studio setting, and as a stand-alone, rack-mounted unit for live performance processing. Auto-Tune has become standard equipment in professional recording studios.

Auto-Tune was first created by Andy Hildebrand, an engineer working for Exxon. Hildebrand developed methods for interpreting seismic data, and then realized that the technology could be used to detect, analyze, and modify pitch.

Auto-Tune was used for vocal effects on Cher's "Believe", recorded in 1998. This was the first major hit song to use the software for this purpose. At first the sound engineers claimed that they had used a vocoder, in what "Sound on Sound" said was an attempt to keep a trade secret. After the massive success of "Believe", many artists copied the technique, which became known as the "Cher Effect". It can be heard in songs of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Some notable examples are Gigi D'Agostino's "La Passion" and Janet Jackson's US Number 1 hit "All For You". Auto-Tune became famous again in the mid-2000s when R&B singer T-Pain made active use of it in his songs. This technique has been copied by many other modern R&B and pop artists, including Usher, Beyonce, Rihanna, and Justin Bieber. T-Pain has even had an iPhone App named after him that copies the effect called "I Am T-Pain".

The "Boston Herald" revealed that country music stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw have both said they are using Auto-Tune in performance. They said it is a safety net that guarantees a good performance. Sara Evans, John Michael Montgomery and Gary LeVox of the group Rascal Flatts also use Auto-Tune to fix pitch problems. However, other country music singers, such as Loretta Lynn, Allison Moorer, Trisha Yearwood, Vince Gill, Garth Brooks, Martina McBride, and Patty Loveless, have refused to use Auto-Tune.

YouTube musical group The Gregory Brothers have joined their original music tracks with Auto-Tuned versions of mundane evening news video clips, making fun of everyone from President Barack Obama to Antoine Dodson. The popularity of their YouTube channel led the Gregory Brothers to release many of their songs on iTunes.

In 2002, the CD "Miss Fortune" by singer-songwriter Allison Moorer was released with a sticker stating that "Absolutely no vocal tuning or pitch correction was used in the making of this record". At the 51st Grammy Awards in early 2009, the band Death Cab for Cutie wore blue ribbons to protest the use of Auto-Tune in the music industry. Later that spring, Jay-Z named the lead single of his album "The Blueprint 3" as "D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)". Jay-Z said that far too many people had jumped on the Auto-Tune bandwagon and that the trend had become a gimmick. Christina Aguilera appeared in public in Los Angeles on August 10, 2009 wearing a T-shirt that read, "Auto Tune is for Pussies". However when interviewed by Sirius/XM, she said that Auto-Tune wasn't bad if used "..in a creative way". She said her album "Bionic" uses the technology and highlighted "Elastic Love" being a product of it.

Opponents of the plug-in argue Auto-Tune people will not treat musicians with respect in they need help to stay in tune. A "Chicago Tribune" report from 2003 states that "many successful mainstream artists in most genres of music—perhaps a majority of artists—are using pitch correction". 

In 2004, "The Daily Telegraph" music critic Neil McCormick called Auto-Tune a "particularly sinister invention that has been putting extra shine on pop vocals since the 1990s" by taking "a poorly sung note and transpos[ing] it, placing it dead center of where it was meant to be".

In 2009, "Time" magazine quoted an unnamed Grammy-winning recording engineer as saying, "Let's just say I've had Auto-Tune save vocals on everything from Britney Spears to Bollywood cast albums. And every singer now presumes that you'll just run their voice through the box." The same article hoped "that pop's fetish for uniform perfect pitch will fade", commenting that pop-music songs are sounding the same, as "track after track has perfect pitch." Timothy Powell, a producer/engineer stated in 2003 that he is "even starting to see vocal tuning devices show up in concert settings"; he states that "That's more of an ethical dilemma—people pay a premium dollar to see artists and artists want people to see them at their best." 

The American television series "Glee" uses Auto-Tune in its songs. E! Online's Joal Ryan criticized the show for its "overproduced soundtrack", in particular, complaining that many songs rely too heavily on the software.

In 2010, there was controversy when British television reality TV show, "The X Factor" had been accused of using Auto-Tune to improve the voices of contestants, especially Gamu Nhengu. Simon Cowell ordered a ban on Auto-Tune for future episodes.

Masai Mara National Reserve is a National Park in Kenya, West Africa. It was established in 1948 as a Wildlife Sanctuary, and has been made larger since then.

Masai Mara is a game reserve type of park, meant to protect the animals on the savannah of the Serengeti. It is named after the Maasi people, who are the traditional people of the area. Big as it is, the Masai Mara National Reserve is only a fraction of the Greater Mara Ecosystem.

The Mara is effectively the northern continuation of the Serengeti National Park game reserve in Tanzania. 

It is famous for its exceptional population of large mammals. Huge numbers of herbivores migrate each year, followed by the big cats. The zebra, Thomson's gazelle, wildebeest, African buffalo, giraffe, elephants and others arrive to eat fresh grass after the rain, and later move on. Lions, leopards, cheetahs follow, as do vultures and hyaenas. hippos and Nile crocodiles are in the rivers. It is called "The Great Migration".

The Great Migration is one of the most impressive natural events worldwide, involving some 1,300,000 wildebeest, 500,000 Thomson's gazelles, 97,000 Topi, 18,000 eland, and 200,000 zebra. These migrants are followed along their annual, circular route by hungry predators, most notably lions and hyena.

More than 470 species of birds have been identified in the park, many of which are migrants, with almost 60 species being raptors. Birds that call this area home for at least part of the year include: vultures, marabou storks, secretary birds, hornbills, crowned cranes, ostriches, long-crested Eagles, African pygmy-falcons and the lilac-breasted roller, which is the national bird of Kenya

Helen Hayes

Helen Hayes Brown (October 10, 1900 – March 17, 1993) was an American actress, whose career lasted for almost 70 years. Known as the "First Lady of the American Theatre", she was one of only twelve people who have won all four main American entertainment awards - Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony. Hayes also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1986, the National Medal of Arts in 1988 and was awarded at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1981. Two Broadway theaters were named after her.

Helen Hayes was born in Washington D.C. on October 10, 1890. She was the only child. Her mother, Catherine Estelle Hayes, was an actress of Irish ancestry. Her father, Francis van Arnum Brown, was a meat salesman. 

Helen was an accomplished child. She went to a dancing school and sang very well. She began a stage career at the age of five, pushed by her mother. She also took her mother's maiden name as her stage name. By the age of ten, she had made a short film. In 1917 Helen graduated from the Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent in Washington.

Her first sound film "The Sin of Madelon Claudet" (1931) brought her Academy Award for Best Actress. The part she played in it, had been written by her husband, Charles MacArthur. Among her other successful movies of that time were "Arrowsmith" (1931), "A Farewell to Arms" (1932), "What Every Woman Knows" (1934).

However, Hayes preferred working in theatre. Her most famous performance on Broadway was the role of Queen Victoria in a play "Victoria Regina" (1938). She played leading parts in "Coquette" (1928) and "Mary Of Scotland" (1933) as well. "Harvey" (1970) became her last hit on stage. Helen had to retire from theatre because of her asthma condition.

She continued her work in movies. Her second Academy Award, this time for Supporting role, Hayes won in 1970, for "Airport". During later part of her career she often appeared in series and movies made for television. She successfully portrayed legendary character Miss Marple in several films in 80s.

Helen Hayes met her husband, Charles MacArthur, a playwright, in 1927. They married in August of 1928. Together they had a daughter, Mary, born in 1930. She became involved in acting, but, sadly, died from polio at the age of 19. It was a great tragedy for them. In 1938 Helen and Charles adopted a son, James MacArthur, who grew up to be an actor. 

Charles MacArthur died in 1956, after many years of illness and grief caused by his daughter's untimely death. Hayes never married again. 

She published several autobiographies: "A Gift of Joy" (1965), "On Reflection" (1968), "Twice Over Lightly" (1972), and "My Life in Three Acts" (1990). 

Helen Hayes died on March 17, 1993 from heart failure in the hospital of Nyack, New York. She was 92. She was buried in the Oak Hill Cemetery, next to her husband and daughter.

Baryon

Baryons are composite particles which are made of three quarks. Since all quarks have a spin of 1/2, a baryon will always have a spin of either 1/2 or 3/2 (the spins can cancel out). The 3/2 spin baryons are extremely unstable, and only live for 10 seconds. After that, they will jump down to a lower energy state by releasing photons containing energy. These 3/2 spin baryons are known as higher energy resonances. the lowest energy state of a baryon is a simple 1/2 spin.

All particles with 1/2 spin (or 3/2 spin) are called fermions, which obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. This basically means that no two fermions can be in the same point in space at the same time. This is not true for the other type of subatomic particle, called a boson. More than one boson--like a photon--can exist in the same point in space at the same time. 

Baryons are part of a larger collection of subatomic compounds called Hadrons. Hadrons are simply particles made of quarks. The other type of Hadron is called a meson.

The name baryon comes from Greek "barys," meaning heavy.

The Upper Triassic or Late Triassic is an epoch in the Mesozoic era. It was between about 230 and 200 million years ago. It was the last of three epochs which make up the Triassic period.

The other two periods of time that make up the Triassic are usually called the Lower and Middle Triassic. 

Many early dinosaur species appeared for the first time during the Upper Triassic, including Plateosaurus, Coelophysis, and Eoraptor. Pterosaurs were common in the air, and Ichthyosaurs dominated the seas. 

At the end of the Upper Triassic some catastrophic event or events caused the extinction of many animal species worldwide. Known as the end–Triassic extinction event, it was similar to the more famous event that lead to the extinction of the dinosaurs, except no one knows for sure what caused the event.

Fondue

Fondue is a Swiss meal taken in an pot ("caquelon") over a small burner ("rechaud") by some men and women round a table . The word comes from the French word naming an operation "fondre" (make liquid by heat).

Long-stemmed forks are used to put bits of food into a warm and liquid sauce. The sauce is warmed by a wax or alcohol burner. 

Cheese fondue with bits of bread is most frequent, however there are other sauces and other bits to put in the sauce. Bread, meat or plants are cut into small bits and used.

A great number of men and women believe that fondue is a very old country way to make food of hard cheese and hard bread. Both Swiss and French men and women make fondue from the old time. It is most likely first made in the Jura mountains.

The oldest certain directions for making fondue used eggs and came from Vaud in the early 19th century. A great number of Swiss places and towns came up with very special directions for making fondue based on cheeses, wines and other substances of the town. 

Fondue became pleasing to a great number of men and women in the United States through the late 1960s and early 1970s.

In addition to the bread and cheese, there are side plates of garlic, pickled cucumber, onions and olives.

To give a special quality of taste, the "caquelon" is first rubbed with a cut garlic. Wine and cheese are added and heated and moved till they are warm and liquid. A small amount of starch is added to join the substances. Some strong alcohol from cherries is added just before bringing it to the table.

The most common directions use 1 decilitre of dry white wine and 200 grams of cheese for every man and woman. The cheese is a mix of hard cheese (such as "Gruyère") and semi-hard (such as Emmental cheese).

A cheese fondue would be kept at a temperature warm enough to keep the fondue smooth and liquid but not at a great heat to cause burning. 

If the temperature is good, there will be a thin hard cover of toasted (not burnt) cheese at the lowest part of the "caquelon". 

This is the "la religieuse" (French for "the nun"). It has the structure of a thin cracker and is lifted out and every man and woman is given a bit. In Switzerland sometimes boys and girls fight over the burnt cheese at the lowest part of the "caquelon".

"Fondue Bourguignonne" is named after Burgundy in France. Fondue Bourguignonne uses a pot of heated oil to cook. Bits of meat are put into the oil to quickly cook them. A number of sauces are made ready on the side. The earliest statments of this dish seem to have been made in the 1950s.

"Fondue Chinoise" uses a pot of heated liquid to cook. Thin bits of meat (often beef) are put into a very warm thin meat soup. As with a Fondue Bourguignonne, a number of sauces are made ready on the side. At the end of the meal, the liquid from the pot is drunk as a thick soup.

"Chocolate Fondue" was first made in the 1960s. Slices of fruit or cake are put in a pot of warm, liquid chocolate.

It would not be good to touch the fork with your tongue, because the fork will go back into the common pot. At a meat fondue, one uses a second fork to take meat off the fork that goes into the common pot. 

In Switzerland what has been done for a long time, is that if a bit of bread is lost in the cheese by a man, he gives money for a bottle of wine. If it is lost by a woman, she kisses the man at her left.

Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna

Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna (Sometimes called Anastasia: The Story of Anna) is a 1986 Golden Globe and Emmy Award-winning TV movie, starring Amy Irving and Olivia de Havilland. The film was loosely based on the story of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia and the novel "The Riddle of Anna Anderson" by Peter Kurth. It was Christian Bale's first film and was originally broadcast in two parts.

The film is about Anna Anderson, who believes that she is Anastasia, daughter of Nicholas II of Russia. Anna first tells her story in the 1920s when she is at a Berlin asylum. Her story of escape from the Bolsheviks who killed the rest of her family in 1918 seems so vivid that many Russians believe her. She slowly gains more trust, but the Romanov family does not believe her. The movie never reveals if Anna really is Anastasia.

Turtle ship

Turtle ship is a warship built by Admiral Yi Sun-sin during a Japanese invasion of Korea in 16th century, Joseon Dynasty, and used to defeat the Japanese Navy. Because it looked like a turtle, it has been called "Turtle ship."

It has a dragon-shaped head, which can fire cannons through its mouth. Its tail can also fire artillery. "Turtle ship" has 12 cannons in each side, so total cannons are 24. As lots of iron nails are stuck in its back, nobody can approach it easily. Moreover, people who are in the "Turtle ship" can see the outside, while exterior people cannot look into it.

Its inside is divided into two floors, one of which is the place where cannons are and the other is where people can row. There are twenty four rooms. Nineteen of them are where soldiers can take a rest. Other three of them are where some weapons, such as swords, arrows and spears, are. In the other three rooms, iron goods can be stored. On the bottom, there is a huge water tank, which can make "Turtle ship" float and sink.

At first, "Turtle ship" was a small warship which can hold about 100~150 soldiers. However, after the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592, it expanded from a two-storied warship to a three-storied one and its hull is longer.

It has several cannons from front to back and side to side, including a dragon-shaped head. Therefore, it take an important role in breaking through the enemy lines at the head of fleets. In addition, it is assumed that iron nails stuck in its back might hit and sink enemy ships with the water tank fulled.

Because it has iron nails and wooden boxes covered with swords in the back, it is distinguished in warding off attacks against enemies. 

It has ten paddles in each side, and four rowers are arranged to one paddle. As its bottom is flat-shaped, it's really easy to maneuver in large tidal ranges, such as The West Sea and The South Sea of Korean Peninsula. It's also possible to do a half-turn in the middle of moving. For these reasons, it's useful in using various techniques of maneuver.

Foot-and-mouth disease

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the acute infectious diseases (highly contagious disease) of animals. Foot-and-mouth disease virus causes the disease which can infect domestic animals such as cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and deer. Generally, it is believed that FMD is not very contagious to humans. However, humans can spread FMD by carrying the virus on their clothes and body. FMD breaks out all over the globe, because it is highly contagious to many animals. The earliest description of FMD was that by Hieronymi Fracastorii (1546). He described the disease, as being unusual and affecting only cattle, when it occurred in northern Italy in 1514.

While the disease is widespread around the world, North America, Central America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Chile, and many countries in Europe are considered free of FMD. Various types of FMD virus have been found in Africa, South America, Asia, and some parts of Europe.

The most obvious signs of Foot and Mouth Disease are excessive slobbering (letting liquid fall from their mouth), a lack of appetite and lameness (unable to walk properly because of damage to one or both of their legs). Affected animals may experience a sudden rise in temperature, sores in the mouth or other areas.



FMD is caused by a virus. Signs of illness can appear after an incubation period (the time from the moment of exposure to an infectious agent until signs and symptoms of the disease appear) of one to eight days, but often develop within three days. Immunity to one type does not protect an animal against other types.

Haeundae

The "Haeundae Beach" is at the southeast end of the city of Busan which is in South Korea. Along the 12 km of coastline is Busan's most popular beach, and one of the most famous beaches in South Korea. "Haeundae" was so named by scholar Choi Chi-Won (857~?) of the Silla Dynasty (BC 57~AD 935). When he was walking past Dongbaekdo Island, he was fascinated by it and carved the words "Hae Un Dae" on a stone wall on the island. Haeundae is 1.5 km long, 30~50m wide, and spans an area of 58,400㎡. The white sand is rough and is rather sticky. The sand of this beach is composed of sand that comes from Chuncheon Stream and shells that have been naturally eroded by the wind over time. 

Haeundae used to be isolated from the large communities in Busan and Busanjin. However hotels, shopping centers and other tourist facilities have been constructed on the beach front area since the mid-1990s, and Haendae is now an rich beach front area. Haeundae New Town, a major commercial and residential redevelopment project begun in 1990 and another development project, Centum City, has been ongoing since early 2000 and is now a major feature of Busan. In Centum City there is the world's largest department store, Shinsegae Department Store and BEXCO (Busan Exhibition and Convention Center) has become a popular venue for international conventions and exhibitions. Marine City, located nearby, is constructed on land reclaimed from the sea, and has several huge, high-rise apartment blocks. 

Haeundae's geographical assets, along with its tourist facilities, have led to a regular role as one of the host venues for the annual Pusan International Film Festival (PIFF), and Haeundae's Dongbeak Island was the location for the 2005 APEC Conference. There are also many beach-related cultural events in Haeundae. Haeundae is one of the most popular spots in Busan to view the first sunrise of the year on January 1, with around a thousand gathering before dawn. Also, one of the most famous beach events happens in the first week of January when the temperature is around 0°C, the "Polar Bear Club", held annually in the spirit of strengthening and praying for good health by Choseon Beach Hotel since 1988. 

Dongbaek Island, located at the south end of the beach, has a view of the sea by car and its coastline is famous for fishing. Oryuk Islets, a symbol of Busan to many Koreans, can be seen in the distance from Dongbaek Island. During the hot summer months, Haeundae beach becomes crowded into a thick human wall with thousands of people and parasols packed into the sand. People visit the beach from all over South Korea, as well as the outside of Korea.

Tanganyika

Tanganyika is the mainland part of Tanzania.

From 9 December 1961 to 26 April 1964 it was an independent state. 

It was an East African territory lying between the Indian Ocean and the African Great Lakes: Lake Victoria, Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika. 

Once part of the larger colony of German East Africa (), it comprised today's Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania, but not Zanzibar.

After World War I the parts that are today's Rwanda and Burundi became a League of Nations mandate governed by Belgium. The major part, however, came under British rule and was transferred to Britain under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. This was confirmed by a League of Nations Mandate in 1922, later becoming a United Nations Trust Territory. Britain changed the name to the "Tanganyika Territory".

On 9 December 1961 Tanganyika became independent as a Commonwealth Realm, and on 9 December 1962 it became the Republic of Tanganyika within the Commonwealth of Nations. In 1964, it joined with the islands of Zanzibar to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, later in the year changed to the "United Republic of Tanzania". 

Although Tanganyika still exists within Tanzania, the name is no longer used formally for the territory. It is, however, a convenient way to refer to the mainland, which is so different geographically and culturally from Zanzibar. The name "Tanganyika" is also used to refer to Lake Tanganyika.

<doc id="274414" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=274414" title="Nicola Pisano">
Nicola Pisano

Nicola Pisano (also called Niccolò Pisano and Nicola de Apulia) (c. 1220/1225 – c. 1284) was an Italian sculptor who is best known for the works that he made for Pisa Cathedral. At a time when most artists worked in the Gothic style, Nicola was influenced by the Ancient Roman sculpture that he saw at Pisa, and copied the style into his own work. For this reason Nicola Pisano is sometimes said to be to be the founder of modern sculpture.

 
Nicola Pisano's birthdate and exact birthplace are unknown. A document in the archives of Siena Cathedral says that he was the son of Petrus de Apulia. In 1245 Nicola was making sculptures at Prato Cathedral and then moved to Pisa where his son Giovanni Pisano was born. 

Around 1255, Nicola received a commission (a paid job) to make the pulpit in the baptistery of Pisa Cathedral. The baptistery was a very large circular domed building that stood near the west doors of the cathedral. Nicola was assisted (helped) by other sculptors including Arnolfo di Cambio who later became a famous architect. The work was finished in 1260 and signed "Nicola Pisanus" which means "Nicholas of Pisa". 

The pulpit is hexagonal (six-sided) and is supported on six columns of coloured stone, with another column under the centre of the pulpit. Four of the columns, including the central one, rest on the backs of carved creatures. Around five sides of the pulpit are white marble panels carved with stories from the life of Jesus. They are the "Annunciation" (telling of Jesus' birth to Mary), the "Nativity" (birth of Jesus), "Angels telling the Shepherds", the "Adoration of the Magi" (the Three Wise Men), "Baby Jesus presented at the Temple", and the "Crucifixion". 

At Pisa Cathedral was a large cloister (a courtyard surrounded by arches) called the Campo Santo and used as a burial place. All around the arcade in the Campo Santo were Ancient Roman "sarcopgagi" (stone coffins), that had been stolen by the navy of Pisa when they had won a battle. Many of the coffins were richly carved with scenes that told stories. The biographer Giorgio Vasari wrote that Nicola Pisano studied these sculptures before he started work on the carvings for the pulpit. Because of this, Nicola's sculpture makes a bridge between the Gothic style of the 1200s, and the Classical style used by Renaissance artists in the 1400s. 
The Baptistery of Pisa had been built by an architect called Diotisalvi, but the work was not finished. Nicola Pisano made the dome much higher, and put decoration all around it which 20 years later had sculpture added by Nicola's son Giovanni Pisano. 

In 1264 Nicola Pisano was aksed to work on a grand shrine in memory of St Dominic, called the "Arca di San Domenico" in the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna. It is believed that Nicola made the main design but many other sculptors worked on it. More than 200 years later, it was still not finished, and Michelangelo, when he was still a teenager, made three small statues for it.

In September 1265 Nicola began work on another a marble pulpit, even grander than the first, this time for Siena Cathedral. The work took three years, and Nicola was helped by his son Giovanni Pisano and his assistants Arnolfo di Cambio, Lapo di Ricevuto and several other artists. 

The pulpit is octagonal in shape and is supported on nine columns, made of granite, porphyry and green marble..
The message of this pulpit is Salvation and the Last Judgment. It has seven sculptured scenes and many small statues. Three of the scenes tell more than one story. All the panels are crowded with figures. 

In July 1273 Nicola Pisano was commissioned to make the altar in the Chapel of St James in Pistoia Cathedral. The chapel was demolished and all that remains is a basin for Holy Water, that was possibly made by Nicola. 

His last main job, from 1277-78, was to make the sculpture panels to surround a very large fountain in the main square of the city of Perugia. (1277–1278). The fountain was designed by Fra Bevignate and Boninsegna. It is thought that most of the sculpture was done by his son Giovanni Pisano. and his assistants.

Oh Se-hoon

Oh Se-hoon(오세훈; 吳世勳) is a Korean politician. He was born on January 4, 1961 in Seoul, Korea. He has been a mayor of Seoul from 2006.

When he was young, his family was extremely poor. He recalls that he should finish his homework before sunset, as it was very hard for his family to use electricity. After he graduated from high school, he entered Hankuk University of Foreign Studies majoring in Law. When he was a sophomore, he moved from HUFS to Korea University. In 1984, he passed the 26th Korean bar examination. After that, he served the military as an officer.

After finishing his military service, he worked as a famous lawyer in Seoul for about 15 years. As a lawyer, he appeared on television programs about law many times. At that time, he was regarded very smart and clean as well as young and handsome.
That made him become very famous, so he challenged to being a politician.

In 2000, he was elected as a member of the National Assembly, belonging to Grand National Party. As a young politician, he tried to break and change the old and conservative image of Grand National Party. After completing the 4 years of his term as a member of the National Assembly, he came back to the lawyer.

Though he leaved from the political world, he was still preferred by many people. He was even expected for the next mayor of Seoul, as the former mayor Lee Myung-bak ran for the President. At first, he consistently denied running for the mayor of Seoul. But as he was considered as the best candidate for the mayor in many surveys, and as Grand National Party persuaded him to run for the mayor, he finally decided to run.

Even before the election, he always won in many polls. As a result, he got over 60% in 2006 election and became the mayor of Seoul easily. In this election, he promised to remove Dongdaemun Stadium, redevelop about 50 towns, establish English towns, and change diesel buses to natural gas buses.

In 2010, he tried to be reelected as a Seoul mayor. In the second attempt, he was expected to easily defeat other candidates again. But in vote counting, he was about to lose and won very hard. As a result, the gap between him and the second candidate, Han Myeong-sook was just about 0.6%.

Though there are many pros and cons toward him, he is often mentioned as a potential president of next term, like former mayor of Seoul and current President, Lee Myung-bak.

Anne Marie d'Orléans

Anne Marie d'Orléans (27 August 1669 - 26 August 1728) was a niece of Louis XIV and was the wife of Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia. She was the mother-in-law of Philip V of Spain and the Dauphin of France.

She was born at the Château de Saint-Cloud. Her mother died when she was ten months old. A year later, her father remarried Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate. Her half-brother Philippe d'Orléans, the future Regent of France. Her stepmother described her as "one of the most amiable and virtuous of women".

Anne Marie d'Orléans' proxy marriage to Víctor Amadeus II took place at Versailles on 10 April 1684. Louis XIV gave her a dowry of 900,000 "livres". She met her husband at Chambéry the following 6 May which were followed by another wedding ceremony. She was the mother of eight children. Anne Marie loved her husband greatly but he soon turned his attentions to his mistresses, one being the famous Jeanne Baptiste d'Albert de Luynes. Anne Marie's eldest child, Marie Adélaïde of Savoy, was sent to Versailles as a young girl in order to learn her future role as queen of France, but she died in 1712. Her husband had two further children with Jeanne Baptiste d'Albert de Luynes, his mistress from 1689 till 1700. Nonetheless, when he fell ill with smallpox, she nursed him until his recovery.

In November 1701, her third daughter, Maria Luisa, then barely thirteen years old, married Philip V of Spain. In 1706, during the siege of Turin by French forces under the command of her half-brother Philippe d'Orléans, and Spanish forces from her cousin Philip V of Spain, she and her sons, Victor Amadeus and Carlo Emanuele, were forced to flee the city. 

As a result of his aid in the War of the Spanish Succession Victor Amadeus II was made King of Sicily in 1713 under the Treaty of Utrecht which ended the war. However Victor Amadeus II was forced to exchange Sicily for the less important kingdom of Sardinia in 1720. As queen, Anne Marie used the Royal Palace of Turin as well as the Villa della Regina which was her own property. Queen Anne Marie died of heart failure at her villa on 26 August 1728, the day before her 59th birthday. She is today buried at the Basilica of Superga in Turin being moved there in 1786 by her son Victor Amadeus III. Her husband, Víctor Amadeus II, abdicated in favour of his son in 1730, and died two years later having married a commoner. 

From 1714 to 1720, Anne Marie d'Orléans was the heiress presumptive to the Jacobite claim to the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland. These claims were held at the time by James Francis Edward Stuart (son of James II) upon the death of his half-sister, Queen Anne. Anne Marie was displaced as his heir by the birth of the Old Pretender's son, Charles Edward Stuart ("Bonnie Prince Charlie") in December 1720. Through Anne Marie descend the current post-Stuart legitimist claims of the Jacobites to the English and Scottish thrones.

Henrietta of England

Henrietta of England (16 June 1644 (26 June n.s.) – 30 June 1670) was born a Princess of England and Scotland as the youngest daughter of King Charles I of England and his consort Henrietta Maria of France. Fleeing England with her governess aged three, she moved to the court of her first cousin Louis XIV of France. She was known as "Minette". She married Philippe of France, "Monsieur", brother of King Louis XIV, and became known as "Madame" at court. Very popular with the court, Henriette was known for her flirtatious nature which was the cause of various arguments between husband and wife. Louise de La Vallière and Madame de Montespan were part of her household prior to being Louis XIV's mistresses. Henriette was instrumental to the completion of the "Secret Treaty of Dover" prior to her unexpected death in June 1670. The reason for her death has never been conclusively determined; while some argue that it was by poison administered by her husband's lover the Chevalier de Lorraine, historians have also argued that she was felled by a perforated peptic ulcer.
The Jacobite claims to the throne following the death of Henry Benedict Stuart descend from her through her daughter Anne Marie, Queen of Sardinia.

Steve Black played five years for the Port Arthur Flyers of the TBJHL making two trips to the Memorial Cup Tournament before joining the PCHL.

After two years in the minors, he finally cracked the NHL with the Detroit Red Wings. The 1950 Wings were already deep in offensive talent with established players such as Gordie Howe, Ted Lindsay and Sid Abel, so Black was told to concentrate on the defensive aspect of the game. As his defensive skills increased, his overall game improved, and was picked to play in the 1950 NHL All Star Game. The highlight of his career came that spring when he won the Stanley Cup with the Red Wings. He started the 1951 season with Detroit before being traded to the Chicago Black Hawks. He would play 39 games for Chicago that season which would also be his last in the NHL. He played in the minor leagues for three more seasons before retiring from hockey in 1954.

I Ching

I Ching (周易), also known as the Book of Changes, is one of the oldest of the Chinese classic texts. It is used mainly for divination (fortunetelling).

As '周' means Zhou Dynasty, it was written in that age. Before Zhou Dynasty (1046 BC-771 BC), there was Shang Dynasty (1600 BC - 1046 BC). Shang Dynasty's main cultural characteristics are its divination and character (old Chinese character). We cannot say which one was first, but it is supposed that characters were made from certain need while doing divination. During Shang Dynasty, divination was done by burning animal's bone or tortoise shell. Zhou Dynasty made Shang cease to exist, but it accepted Shang's culture. In early age of Zhou Dynasty, a new way of divination appeared which was put into writing. It was advanced form of Shang Dynasty's divination, and finally, it took place instead of Shang's divination.

The contents of I Ching consist of 64 hexagrams and explanation for each. Hexagram is a group of six broken or unbroken lines. The unbroken line(line that middle point is empty) represents yang, and the unbroken line represents yin. From the bottom to top, six lines are gathered in parallel. There exists one different name for one hexagram. In I Ching, the name of one hexagram and the hexagram itself comes first, and after those, there are different explanations for the hexagram and the each line consisting hexagram, from bottom to top. There comes next hexagram after explanations of all lines of one hexagram.

The typical divination using I Ching needs the number of fifty thin sticks usually made from bamboo. Using those sticks with certain order, the person who wants to know the result draws hexagram and finds the explanation in the book. To make process simpler, some people use coin to know the result.

In I Ching, the word 'Heaven'(or sky; it corresponds to the Chinese character '天') is considered as same as God or the absolute being with humane character, who decides the good and evil and makes judgements. For example, the explanation of 26th hexagram (大畜 dà chù) is "the Heaven's bliss is given, therefore, lucky."

Also, there is the idea of constantly changing world, as the explanation of 11th hexagram (泰 tài) tells, "Everything flat will be inclined, and everything gone will be come back." Similarly, the idea of endlessness can also be found. The literal meaning of 63th hexagram (既濟 jì jì) is "already (既) finished (濟)", but the last hexagram, which is the 64th (未濟 wèi jì), means "not (未) finished (濟)" literally. This means the process of whole world and life is endless and never stops.

In those golden years Deportivo Italia won the Venezuelan First Division tournament four times (1961, 1963, 1966 and 1972) and the "Copa Venezuela" three times (1961,1962 and 1970), and was runner up in the first division in 1965, 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1971 and in the Copa Venezuela in 1976. 

Deportivo Italia even managed to participate in the Copa Libertadores six times (1964, 1966, 1967, 1969, 1971 and 1972).

In the 1971 Copa Libertadores, Deportivo Italia was even able to defeat 1:0 the Fluminense (Champion of Brasil) in the Estádio do Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro: it was celebrated as "Pequeno Maracanazo" (little Maracanazo).

After 1998 the team suffered a crisis and changed name to "Italchacao". But the following performance of the team was very low in the venezuelan championship.

SQR codes

Secure Quick Response codes or SQR codes are secure high data density two dimensional bar-codes.
QR codes are high density 2D bar codes first created and patented by Denso Wave in Japan QR Codes They are becoming a popular means to encode data for quick machine readable (camera or bar-code scanner)retrieval and decoding on a worldwide basis. Nokia, Apple, and Android smart-phones often already have a mobile application to create and read QR codes and there are numerous mobile application available which can be downloaded from application stores. 

Secure Quick Response codes are as the name implies a secure method for encrypting data into a bar-code which then becomes extremely difficult to decode into the original plain text in the absence of the encryption cipher or key. A typical implementation of SQR codes would be to create a one-time use SQR code on a mobile handset's high resolution screen to effectively create a highly secure one-time-pad type of encryption One Time Pad of for example an on-line account number. SQR codes because they can be used on hundreds of millions of already installed phones and because no additional hardware on the mobile handset is necessary, can operate in a similar fashion to NFC handsets for secure mobile payments. A typical implementation is to encrypt and use a precursor physical machine readable token such as the card identity number (CID) written in read-only-memory (ROM) of a Secure Digital microSD card contained in a mobile telephone or even the international mobile identity number (IMEI) IMEIin the event no microSD card is present as for example on an Apple iPhone. SQR codes may be securely machine read in a retail environment at the POS using prevalent 2D bar-code scanners or even a low cost web camera. Secure Quick Response codes were first developed by Yodo a company operating in Japan and are patent pending.

<doc id="274530" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=274530" title="Goryeo">
Goryeo

The Goryeo Dynasty also called the "Kingdom of Goryeo", is one of the Korean dynasties which existed from 918 to 1392. It began in 918 with Emperor Taejo. The name "Goryeo" came to be said as "Korea" by foreigners and is still the name of the country. Goryeo united the Later Three Kingdoms of Korea (Later Baekje, Later Goguryeo, and Silla) and by 1374 ruled most of the Korean peninsula until it was removed by the Joseon dynasty in 1392. Goryeo increased its borders to Chung-cheon river and Youngheong (936~943) and the Amnok River (933).

Silla had accomplished an unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea in 668. But it weakened as local lords achieved power during the end of the 9th century. The country entered a period of civil war and rebellion, led by Gung Ye, Gi Hwon, Yang Gil, and Gyeon Hwon. Gung Ye established Hugogureo (meaning "Later Goguryeo") and Wang Geon (Later, Tae jo) made a contribution as Gung Ye's subordinate. However, Gung Ye became more and more tyrannical and finally killed his own wife and son. Also he insisted that he was Maitreya (the future Buddha). Meanwhile, Wang Geon increased his power as he conquered Geumsung area in Later Baekje. Finally, some people who followed Wang Geon broke out the rebellion and he named the dynasty as Goryeo and changed its capital city to Song-ak. 

Goryeo made the policy to win the favor of people and maintained good relationship with Silla. As a result, Silla surrendered unconditionally to Goryeo. Meanwhile, Later Baekje collapsed by itself as princes fought each other over uccession to the throne. Because of the internal conflict, Later Baekje became weaker and weaker and was conquered by Goryeo. Finally, Goryeo united the Later Three Kingdoms again (936) and accomplished re-unification of Korean people. 
Tae jo made important policies. First, he insisted that Goryeo should expand its territory to further North. It is because he succeed to Goguryeo (ancient Korean kingdom founded in 37 BC–668) and Goguryeo had the biggest territory in Korean history. So, Tae jo named the dynasty as Goryeo from Goguryeo and tried to take back the territory of Goguryeo. He emphasized the importance of Sukyung area because it is placed in the North part and kept in check Gu Ran (kind of Mongolian) that made an effort to come down to Goryeo. Later, all of these policies contributed to expanding its territory to Apnok River. Also, Tae Jo made the policy which unified all people from different dynasties (Baekje, Silla, Goguryeo, Balhae..). Because of this policy, Goryeo is considered that it accomplished actual unification compared to Silla.

Composite particle

Composite particles are subatomic particles that are made of more than one quark. Simple particles like protons are actually composites of multiple quarks. Protons are known as baryons, which means that they are made of exactly three quarks. Baryons are in a family called Hadrons, which simply means that they are made of quarks. The only other subcategory of Hadrons is Mesons, which are made of one quark and one antiquark. 

Since they are made of quarks, composite particles are not so much hard balls, but rather like clouds that contain these quarks. Depending on the energy contained by the quarks, the quarks of a proton vibrate, and this gives a proton a size larger than the actual size of the three quarks combined.

During a very short period of time, South Korea has accomplished a rapid industrialization where the Han River has played an important role. This is referred to as "Miracle on the Han River".

In Korea history, Han river played a central role. The rise and fall of the nation depended on taking the Han river. Especially in three kingdom period, there were fierce struggles to take the Han river. Baekje was the first to take the Han river. They recognized it as a primary waterway that links the central western region of the peninsula with the Yellow Sea. The kingdom of Goguryeo took the Han river during the reign of its King Jangsu. In 553, Silla broke its alliance with Baekje and took the control of the entire river.
Han River has been called by different names during the period of the three kingdom period. The state of Goguryeo called it the Arisu, Baekje called it the Ugniha, while the kingdom of Silla termed it the Iha. 

There are 27 Bridges crossing the Han River in Seoul National Capital Area(Seoul, Gyeonggi, Incheon).

Somewhere around June 2010, the technical team of Wikimedia released a new look of Wikipedia to the English Wikipedia, the vector skin. It is one great improvement to the look of Wikipedia since the old skin of Monobook is dull. This step is initiated by a grant given by the Ford Foundation.

This grant lasted for one year, which had many more upgrades of the usability of Wikipedia and its sister projects.

Now, you will see greater improvements to Wikimedia. The new release of the extension will make uploading media files to will be much easier and enjoyable. It is now live .

As you can see from the , there are many countries around the world celebrating this event of Wikipedia turning 10 years old. We should indeed take this chance to thank Wikipedia with all our heart since it has helped us in many ways.

Wikipedia should have helped you in:

Imagine how would life be without Wikipedia!(actually it is possible, if you are as smart as Jimmy Wales to create one before he does)

So, take time now to plan your country's/city's/town's/neighborhood's/house's celebration of this great event!

I have noticed recently, that many people of the Simple English Wikipedia did not know that the Simple English Wiktionary even existed. If that is what you think, you are wrong! The Simple English Wiktionary had already existed for 6 years!

I understand that creating new entries for the Simple English Wiktionary is much tougher than creating pages here on the Simple English Wikipedia. But we do have many tutorials on how to create your first entry. We also have simplified the list of words that you can create. Seriously, in my opinion, creating new entries in the Simple English Wiktionary is much easier than creating articles on the Simple English Wikipedia. You just need to know the definitions of that word and it is ready to be published!

The Simple English Wiktionary is currently holding a logo vote for the new Wiktionary logo as seen on Meta. We welcome new comments on the logos, especially if you voted on Meta. Click here to go to the voting page.

The original members of the group were Tiger JK and DJ Shine, however DJ Shine left in 2005 after recording five albums. When DT has performances, Tiger JK takes two other rappers: Bizzy and Paloalto. Tiger JK's wife, Yoon Mirae(T), who is also a singer and rapper, often performs with DT.

Originally the name of "Drunken Tiger" was the name of a hip hop clan. Tiger JK made his debut in 1992 at Los Angeles hiphop festival. After his debut, many hiphop fellows joined the DT clan and he made a debut in Korea in 1998. The first team members were Micki Eyez and Sucram. When Tiger JK and DJ Shine made joined together, they used the team name of Drunken Tiger. DT's first album was "Year of The Tiger", and the debut songs are "Do you know hip hop (Return of Tiger)" and "I want you (Sweet Talk)".

When DJ Shine left DT it caused a was great concern in the Korean hip hop community. It is not known why DJ Shine quit DT. Tiger JK is the only member of DT, and he continues using the name of DT. His Tiger Clan members co-work with him, so Tiger JK made three more albums with his clan members.

Organometallic catalysis

Organometallic catalysis is the chemistry of using molecules with carbon-metal bond(s) to lower the activation energy of a reaction.

Compounds are the result of atoms bonding together. Atoms are the basic unit of matter. When atoms bond they “stick” by sharing electrons, electrons are sub-atomic particles with a negative charge.

Chemistry dealing with compounds containing a metal-carbon bond. Organometallics combines disciplines of organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry.

Examples of organometallic compounds are tetraethyllead image; it was used as a fuel (leaded gasoline) additive in the past. Also Methylcobalamin () is a very common organometallic compound.

In the image below The Fe(red) metal binds two organic rings together. In the ring structures each point represents a carbon atom. So ferrocene has 10 carbon atoms, 5 in the ring above the iron and 5 in the ring below.

Organic chemistry deals with carbon chemistry, synthesis, bonding and reactions. The elements C (carbon), H (hydrogen), N (nitrogen), O (oxygen) are the most common elements used in organic chemistry, however other elements can sometimes be found in organic compounds. Organic chemistry gives us plastics, drugs, petrochemicals, food, explosives, paints, etc.), with very few exceptions, it is the basic chemistry of life.

Inorganic chemistry deals with all other chemistry not containing carbon-hydrogen bonds. Table salt is an excellent example of inorganic chemistry; sodium metal and chlorine combine via an ionic bond to make this crystalline solid. 

Catalysis is the act of using a catalyst to increase the rate of a chemical reaction.

Rate is how fast or slow a chemical reaction happens.

Catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a reaction however it is not consumed in a reaction like the other reagents. 

The link below shows a graph that is a general graphical interpretation of a catalyst’s effect on the activation energy. The Y (vertical) axis shows the activation energy while the x (horizontal) axis shows the reaction over time. With no catalyst present (black line) the reaction has a higher energy to overcome. In the presence of a catalyst (red line) the activation energy is reduced.

Research is currently under way using organometallic catalysis. The energy crisis has initiated increased interest in more efficient ways of working with the remaining fossil fuels we have left. While many agree that lowering oil dependence is safer for the environment as well as politically wise. The new interest in “green” technologies has also helped increase research. Many examples of organometallic research can be found in the petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. Some current methods of chemical production are wasteful and produce toxic waste, while many organometallic catalysts show promise to change that.

Gerry Davey

John Gerald Davey (September 5, 1914 – February 12, 1977) is a former ice hockey player who played in the English National League (ENL). He also played for the Great Britain national ice hockey team which won the gold medal at the 1936 Winter Olympics (see Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics). He is a member of the British Ice Hockey Hall of Fame.

Although born in Barking, England, Davey learned to play ice hockey in Port Arthur, Ontario with the Elmwood Midgets after his family emigrated there when he was a child.

When he was 16-years-old, Davey's mother returned with him to England in 1931. He got a place with the Princes club playing in the English League with the help of a London newspaper. After a short time with ZSC Lions in Switzerland, he returned to the UK to play with Streatham in 1933 before eventually moving on to play with the Falkirk Lions in the Scottish National League between 1938 and 1940, whom he also coached in 1938–39.

During World War II, Davey joined the Royal Canadian Navy continuing to play ice hockey in the Toronto Services League. After the war in 1946, Davey returned to Streatham where he took up playing in defence having previously played right wing. Davey then moved the Wembley Lions the following year for the 1947–48 season. Davey then turned his hand to refereeing before returning to playing for a brief spell during the 1949–50 season with the Streatham Royals in the Intermediate League.

After arriving in England, Davey made an immediate impact with the Princes club and was selected to play for the GB national team in the 1932 European Championships held in Berlin. The team finished the tournament in seventh position with Davey scoring seven of the team's eleven goals.

Davey went on to play for the GB national team at all the international tournaments between 1932 and 1939, most notably the team which took part in the 1936 Winter Olympics. Having fallen ill, Davey came back from his sick bed to score 40 seconds into the game against Canada — which GB won 2–1 — helping the team along the way to securing the gold medal.

Davey also helped the GB team to a bronze medal in the 1935 World Championships, which also earned a silver medal in the European Championships, and a silver medal in the 1937 and 1938 World Championships. Following World War II, Davey again represented GB at the 1948 Winter Olympics when they finished in sixth place.

Davey scored a total of forty-three goals for the GB national team, a record which still stands.

K1A1 Tank

The K1A1 is a remodeled and upgraded version of K1, the main battle tank of the South Korean army. It looks similar to the K1 tank. The first test model, made by Hyundai, was shown to the public on April 3, 1996. It went through performance tests for two years from 1999 to 2001. Production began on October 13, 2001. It is planned to produce 484 of them by 2010. The K2 Black Panther is planned to replace it after that.

The reason for the upgrade was to increase the fire power of the K1. The main 105mm gun was replaced with the M256 120mm gun. The M256 122mm has 1.5 times the range and 1.7 times stronger fire power than the older gun. It also changed its armor, called Korean Special Armor Plate (KSAP), which greatly improved its side shield.

The K1A1 weighs about 53.2 tons and can seat four people. Besides the main gun, there are two kinds of machine guns, 12.7mm K6 and two 7.62mm M60s as secondary arms. Guns and a turret are able to move independently of the main body. This improves its accuracy rate.

The K1A1 is designed for Korea’s mountainous land. It provides a smoother ride as well as higher speed driving on a sloping hill, compared to the K1. The maximum speed is around 65km/h on the level ground, 40km/h on the mountains. Its fire control system involves KCPS (Korea Commander’s Panoramic Sight), KGPS (Korean Gunners Primary Sight), digital ballistic calculator, and some minor factors. The notable fact is that the development of this system was mostly done by Korean technology.

There is what's called a "civil defense drill" in Korea. It is held so that the nation can be ready to evacuate in case of an emergency situation.

It was originally focused on preparing for possible enemy attacks, but has evolved to prepare for a bigger selection of emergencies. Possible emergency scenarios include biochemical attack, nuclear accidents, and terrorism.

This evacuation drill was originally held on the 15th of every month. However, it only takes place two days out of the year these days. 

When the clock hits 2 in the afternoon, sirens will go off signaling the start of the drill. It lasts for 20 minutes during which all cars are required to stop. Civilians are asked to evacuate to indoor shelters and tune into the radio.

Köpenick part of the German capital city of Berlin. It is at the meeting place of two rivers, the Dahme and Spree. 

It is known for the famous imposter Wilhelm Voigt, the "Captain of Köpenick". 

Köpenick was an independent town until 1920. It then became a borough of Berlin, with an area of , making it Berlin's largest borough. In 2001, the borough of Köpenick was merged with that of Treptow to create the current borough of Treptow-Köpenick.
A lot of Köpenick's area is covered with forests and water, such as the Müggelsee lake. 

The Spree connects Köpenick with the Müggelsee and the Berlin city centre. The Oder-Spree Canal links the Dahme, at nearby Schmöckwitz, with the Oder river, at Eisenhüttenstadt, thus providing a navigable connection between Köpenick and the Oder. 

There are so many forests and parks in Köpenick is sometimes called the "green lungs" of Berlin. The Müggelberge hills in the south-east of Köpenick reach , making them the highest natural point of Berlin.

Köpenick is divided into 8 zones:

For many years Köpenick was an independent town. Its was first mentioned as a stronghold in 1209. This means Köpenick is older than Berlin-Cölln, which was first mentioned in a 1237 deed. For the most part of Köpenick's history, the town was known as "Cöpenick".

In 1631, during the Thirty Years' War, the emissaries of George William, Elector of Brandenburg went to Köpenick to meet the approaching army of Gustav Adolph, King of Sweden, to try to stop the devastation of Brandenburg. 

In 1906, a shoemaker called Wilhelm Voigt pretended to be a Prussian officer and took over the town hall of Köpenick. A play was made about the event, and later several films and television shows.

Marie Clotilde of France

Marie Clotilde of France (23 September 1759 – 7 March 1802) was Queen of Sardinia as wife of Charles Emmanuel IV. She was the sister of Louis XVI. 

Baptied as "Marie Adélaïde Clotilde Xavière", she was born at Versailles and known as Madame Clotilde. She was a daughter of Louis, Dauphin of France, only son of Louis XV, and Maria Josepha of Saxony. Because she was overweight, Marie Clotilde was nicknamed "Gros-Madame". She was raised with her sister Élisabeth. 

On 27 August 1775, Louis XVI had his sister Marie Clotilde married in Versailles to Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Piedmont, eldest son of Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia and of his wife Maria Antonia of Spain. Marie Clotilde had been taught Italian while at Versailles. In Savoy, jokes were made about her weight. Although the union was political, Marie Clotilde and Charles Emmanuel were devoted to each other. However they had no children.

In 1796, her husband became king. Marie Clotilde and her husband fled to Naples and lived as guests of the wealthy Colonna. Marie Clotilde died on 7 March 1802. Charles Emmanuel later abdicated on 4 June 1802 in favour of his younger brother, Victor Emmanuel. Marie Clotilde was buried in the Church of Santa Caterina a Chiaia in Naples.

Louis, Dauphin of France (1729–1765)

Louis of France (4 September 1729 – 20 December 1765) was the only surviving son of King Louis XV of France and his wife, Marie Leszczyńska. He was the Dauphin of France all his life. He was the father of three kings of France, Louis XVI, Louis XVIII and Charles X.

Louis was born at the Palace of Versailles. As the heir apparent to the throne of France, he was given the traditional title of Dauphin of France.

Louis' governess was Madame de Ventadour. From an early age Louis took a great interest in the military arts. He was very close to his three oldest sisters.

In 1744 Louis XV negotiated a marriage between his fifteen year old son and the nineteen year old Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain, daughter of King Philip V of Spain and Elisabeth Farnese. The marriage contract was signed 13 December 1744 and the marriage was celebrated by proxy at Madrid 18 December 1744 and in person at Versailles 23 February 1745. Louis and Maria Teresa Rafaela were well matched and had a real affection for each other. They had one daughter Princess Marie Thérèse of France who died in infancy and killed her mother. 

On 10 January 1747 Louis was married by proxy at Dresden to Maria Josepha of Saxony, the fifteen year old younger daughter of Frederick Augustus II, Prince-Elector of Saxony and King of Poland and his wife, Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria. A second marriage ceremony took place in person at Versailles on 9 February 1747.

Louis died of consumption at Fontainebleau in 1765 at the age of thirty-six. Louis was buried in the Cathedral of Saint-Étienne in Sens. His heart was buried at the Basilica of Saint-Denis.

Marie Leszczyńska

Marie Leszczyńska (Trzebnica, 23 June 1703 – Versailles, 24 June 1768) was a queen of France as wife of Louis XV. In France, she was referred to as Marie Leczinska. She was the longest serving Queen consort of France.

Born Maria Karolina Zofia Felicja Leszczyńska h. Wieniawa, she was the second daughter of Stanisław Leszczyński and his wife Katarzyna Opalińska.

Maria was on a list of 99 eligible European princesses to marry the young king. The marriage by proxy took place on 15 August 1725 in the cathedral of Strasbourg, Louis XV being represented by his cousin Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans. She had nine children. Marie had a very close relationship to her children.

On 4 September 1725, she married Louis XV of France. They had eleven children:


Queen Marie never managed to acquire any political influence. Marie was a devout Roman Catholic. She was also a great lover of music and painting and the protector of many artists. Marie died at Versailles on 24 June 1768, six years before her husband. Her family sincerely grieved her death. She was buried at the Basilica of St Denis, and her heart was deposed at the church of Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours in Nancy (Lorraine).

<doc id="274658" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=274658" title="Photocatalysis">
Photocatalysis

Photocatalysis is using light as a catalyst to increase the rate of a photoreaction. Most known photoreactions begin when light creates a free radical in the reaction system. Light can have a lot of energy and is able to break chemical bonds. For example some things fade or lose their color when left in sunlight. When light breaks the chemical bonds, free radicals are produced. A free radical is a molecule, atom or an ion that needs an electron. The free radical will take electrons from other molecules or atoms and this starts chemical reactions.

Photo- is a prefix showing that light is involved.
Photolysis is when light cuts (breaks bonds) of a molecule.
In a chemical reaction there are reactants also called reagents that you begin with. Once the reaction takes place you have products. In the example below methane 
(CH) and oxygen (O) are the reactants and carbon dioxide (CO) and water (HO) are the products. 

"CH + 2O → CO + 2HO"

Catalysis is using a catalyst to change the rate of a chemical reaction. For the reactants to become the products the reaction must overcome an energy barrier. This energy barrier is known as the activation energy (E). For example, when you lit the methane gas you are providing the activation energy to burn(react). 
Rate is how fast or slow a chemical reaction happens.
Catalyst is a substance present but not consumed in a reaction like the other reagents while increasing the rate of the reaction. The graph below shows the catalyst’s effect on the activation energy. The Y (vertical) axis shows the activation energy while the x (horizontal) axis shows the reaction over time. With no catalyst present (black line) the reaction has a higher energy to overcome. In the presence of a catalyst (red line) the activation energy is reduced.
In a vacuum light travels at c, c= 2.99792458X108 m/s that’s 186,000 miles in one second. 

The up and down pattern is how we show light. The high points are called crests and the low are called troughs.(Image) Light has three characteristics that we use to describe it. Wavelength (λ) is the distance between two peaks that are next to each other. Frequency (ν) is the number of times a unit of light can pass by a point over time. Amplitude is the vertical distance between a peak and the next trough. 

Photocatalysis is getting more attention from the scientific community due to the “green movement” 
An example of organometallic research is mimicking photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process that plants use to make sugar for food. Plants use only carbon dioxide gas from the air, water and sunlight. Plants actually have an organometallic molecule containing Mn that helps them perform this reaction. Scientists hope to make an organometallic molecule that can make organic products like fuels using only carbon dioxide, water and light. If this process could be harnessed it could dramatically reduce pollution, because the carbon you make your fuel with is the carbon dioxide from the air.

X-ray crystallography

X-ray crystallography is a way to see the three-dimensional structure of a molecule. The electron cloud of an atom bends the X-rays slightly. This makes a "picture" of the molecule that can be seen on a screen. It can be used for both organic and inorganic molecules. The sample is not destroyed in the process.

The technique was jointly invented by Sir Lawrence Bragg (1862–1942) and his son Sir William Bragg (1890–1971). They won the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1915. Lawrence Bragg is the youngest to be made a Nobel Laureate. He was the Director of the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge University, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was made by James D. Watson and Francis Crick in February 1953.

Spectroscopy instrumentation

Spectroscopy is a involves the interactions between light and matter that allow us to analyze the structure of molecules based on variations in their absorption of electromagnetic radiation. Instrumentation is defined as the method of measurement and control.

How do we prove what we have synthesized? Or how much of something we have made? Molecules are far too small to be observed under a microscope like cells. To gauge what we are dealing with there are sub-atomic particles (protons, neutrons and electrons), atoms, atoms combine to form molecules, millions of specific molecules make up cells, thousands of specialized cells make up tissue, combinations of tissues make organs, a collection of specialized organs make organisms. Spectroscopy provides scientists with the ability to identify various chemical species. These various methods are based on different chemical properties like functional groups, symmetry, structure etc. The efforts of thousands of scientists over time have resulted in some very clever means by which we can identify molecules.

IR spectroscopy Uses the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The highlight of IR spectroscopy is that it is very useful in identifying functional groups of organic molecules. The absorption of infrared light by organic molecules causes molecular vibrations. The vibrational frequencies are unique to the individual functional groups. IR spectra is given graphically by transmittance(%) vs. wavenumber (cm-1)

X-Ray crystallography is a technique that yields the three-dimensional structure of a crystalline molecule. The electron cloud of each atom diffracts the x-rays thus revealing the positions of the atoms. Various inorganic and organic molecules can be crystallized and used in this method including DNA, proteins, salts and metals. The sample used for analysis is not destroyed. 

UV-Vis uses visible light and ultra violet light to determine the amount of a substance dissolved in a solution. The color of the solution is the basis for how UV-Vis works. The color of the solution we are working with is colored because of its chemical composition. So the solution absorbs some light colors and reflects other colors, the light it reflects is the color of the solution. UV-Vis spectroscopy works by passing light through a sample of your solution then determining how much light gets absorbed by the solution.

Nuclear magnetic resonance uses the magnetic properties of certain nuclei the most common being C and H. The NMR instrument generates a large magnetic field that makes the nuclei act like tiny bar magnets. The nuclei either align with the instruments magnetic field or against it. At this point we have two possible orientations the nuclei could be in α or β. Next the nuclei are exposed to radio waves that make α go to the β orientation. When this change occurs energy is given off and detected. The data is interpreted graphically (Intensity vs. chemical shifts in ppm) by a computer system. NMR does not destroy the sample you use for analysis. Below is a 900 MHz NMR system.

Italian Renaissance art

Italian Renaissance art is a style of painting and sculpture that began in the late 13th century (1200s) with the work of the painter Giotto and a sculptor Nicola Pisano. The Renaissance way of painting and sculpting did not become the usual style until about 100 years later. From 1400 to about 1600 many artists in Italy used and developed the style. Leonardo da Vinci is a very famous example of an artist in this style. 

The city of Florence is a birthplace of the Renaissance and in particular, of Renaissance art. 

Italian Renaissance painting can be divided into four periods: 

The Proto-Renaissance begins with the works of the painter Giotto and includes Taddeo Gaddi, Orcagna and Altichiero and the sculptor Nicola Pisano. 
The Early Renaissance was the time of the painters Masaccio, Fra Angelico, Uccello, Piero della Francesca and Verrocchio, and the sculptors Ghiberti and Donatello. 
The High Renaissance was the time of Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael and Titian as well as Michelangelo who was famous as a sculptor and as a painter.
The Mannerist period was the time of Andrea del Sarto, Pontormo and Tintoretto and the sculptors Giambologna and Cellini. 

 
Cosimo de' Medici was intelligent, deeply religious, very rich, and wanted to be remembered as a man who did great things for Florence. He was a great patron of the arts and learning. He paid artists to make many beautiful paintings and sculptures. He collected many books, that were given to the Friary of St Mark so that a library could be made and many people could use them. After Cosimo, his sons Piero and Giovanni, and his grandsons Lorenzo and Giuliano continued to be patrons of the arts and of learning. They gathered a group of philosophers, poets and artists together in the "Medici Academy".

Cunard Line

Cunard Line is a shipping company that was founded in 1840 and runs cruise ships all over the world.

Cunard was formed in 1840 by Samuel Cunard after he decided to start a company that would carry mail from England to the United States. England paid for the costs of this service, since the country wanted a more regular service than the sailing ships of the time could do. Cunard started with four steam ships that made crossings of the Atlantic Ocean once a week. The company became known for its record of good safety—while ships of other companies often sank, killing many people, these sorts of things rarely happened to Cunard.

By the early 1900s, though, Cunard was faced with many other ships from several countries also competing with it for passengers going across the Atlantic. This caused the company to build three new ships, larger and faster than the ones before them. They were named RMS "Mauretania", RMS "Lusitania" and RMS "Aquitania". Theses ships made Cunard back into a leading shipping line, even though "Lusitania" was sunk during World War I by a German submarine, killing 1,200 people.

In 1934, another big Cunard ship, the RMS "Queen Mary", began service. She was the largest ship ever built at that time. During World War II, "Queen Mary" and another new ship like her, "Queen Elizabeth", carried many soldiers to support England and the US.

By the 1960s, people preferred to cross the Atlantic by jet airplanes rather than by ships, so Cunard sold most of their ships, or made them cruise ships instead of ocean liners. Cunard still decided to build one new ocean liner, though, RMS "Queen Elizabeth 2". She started service in 1969 and became a very popular ship because she made both cruises and crossings of the Atlantic.

In 1998, Carnival Corporation bought Cunard. Soon after, the company decided to build a new ocean liner that would make both cruises and Atlantic crossings like "Queen Elizabeth 2", but would be bigger. This ship entered service in 2004 and is named RMS "Queen Mary 2".

Cunard operates three ships as of 2010, and has operated many more in the past. The three that are in service are RMS "Queen Mary", MS "Queen Victoria", and MS "Queen Elizabeth".

This did not change the invasion Hitler thought that the Soviet territory would double their amount of resources and expand the War to Asia and help fight with Japan also thinking that the Red Army would be easy to defeat, Though Hitler was wrong. A freezing Russian winter broke in and froze many of the tank's fuel and men were still wearing summer uniforms which they stuffed with newspapers in an attempt to stay warm. The war lasted only for a few months with a German victory, But the Soviets struck back when the Allies invaded Normandy. The Soviets invaded, and continued to occupy more German Territories in Eastern Europe When they Reached the capital the Battle of Berlin began. Hitler and Nazi Germany crumbled as the war ended in Europe.

Larry Walters

Lawrence Richard Walters, nicknamed "Lawnchair Larry" or the "Lawn Chair Pilot", (April 19, 1949 – October 6, 1993) was an American truck driver. On 2 July 1982 he flew very high in the sky in a homemade aircraft. He called his flying machine "Inspiration I". It was made of an ordinary outdoor chair and 45 large balloons full of helium. Walters went up of more than 15,000 feet. He went from San Pedro, California into an area near Los Angeles International Airport that was only for airplanes. Many newspapers reported his flight and he became famous. Later, he had problems and killed himself.

Walters had always dreamed of flying. He was unable to become a pilot in the United States Air Force because he could not see well enough. Walters had first thought of using weather balloons to fly at age 13. He got the idea when he saw the balloons hanging from the ceiling of a military surplus store. Twenty years later he decided to do try it. He planned to attach a few large balloons filled with helium to his lawnchair and then float above his backyard. He planned to stay about 30 feet up in the air for several hours. He had a pellet gun to break some balloons and move back to the ground softly.

In 1982, Walters and his girlfriend, Carol Van Deusen, bought 45 eight-foot weather balloons. They got helium tanks from California Toy Time Balloons. They used a fake letter from his employer, FilmFair Studios. It said the balloons were for a television commercial.

They went to the backyard of a home at 1633 W. 7th St. in San PedroWalters attached the balloons to his lawnchair, filled them with helium. He put on a parachute and used belts to hold himself in the chair. He took his pellet gun, a CB radio, sandwiches, cold beer, and a camera. His friends cut the rope that tied his lawn chair to his Jeep and Walters' lawnchair went up very quickly. Soon, he was 15,000 feet up in the air.

At first, he was afraid to shoot any balloons. He thought he might change the way the chair pointed and fall out. He could not control which way he moved. He slowly passed over Long Beach and moved into the space where airplanes came into Long Beach Airport.

He used his CB radio to contact people on the ground. Some people made a recording of the conversation. Walters asked them to tell the airport what was happening. He also asked them to tell people he was OK.

After 45 minutes in the sky, he shot several balloons. Then he accidentally dropped his pellet gun. He went down slowly until cables hanging from the balloon got caught in an electrical power line. This caused a blackout in a Long Beach neighborhood for 20 minutes. Walters was able to climb to the ground.

The Long Beach Police Department was waiting for him. They arrested him immediately. A reporter asked Larry why he had done it. Walters said, "A man can't just sit around."

At first, Walters was fined US$4,000 for breaking U. S. Federal Aviation Regulations. Walters tried to have the fine cancelled. It was reduced to US$1,500.

Walters received the top prize from the Bonehead Club of Dallas for his adventure. He was on television programs such as "The Tonight Show" and "Late Night with David Letterman". He got a special prize in 1982 at the Darwin Awards.

The TV show "MythBusters" made a flight like Walters had done. But they used a rope to keep the chair from going too high. One of the show's hosts went up about 30m. He went back down slowly by shooting balloons with a pellet gun.

Larry gave the lawnchair from the flight to a boy named Jerry because the boy liked him. Later, Walters realized that was a mistake when the Smithsonian Institute asked him to donate it to its museum. Twenty years later, Jerry contacted Mark Barry. Barry is a pilot wrote about Walters and made a website about his flight. The chair was still sitting in Jerry's garage and had some of the original ropes and water jugs.

Walters said that he had dreamed about flying this way for twenty years. And, that if he had not tried it, he would have become crazy. He did not think that reaching his goal in life would cause so much excitement or make so many people laugh.

After his flight, he quit his job as a truck driver. He was in a Timex print advertisement in the early '90s, He also gave speeches to help people get more confidence. But, he never made much money from being famous. Walters hiked in the San Gabriel Mountains and did volunteer work for the United States Forest Service. He broke up with his girlfriend after 15 years. He worked as a security guard sometimes.

In 1993, Walters shot himself in the heart in Angeles National Forest and died. He was 44 years old.

Kent Couch is a gas station owner from Bend, Oregon. He flew 240 miles in his lawn chair on Saturday, 7 July 2007. He landed in a field about 3½ miles NNW of North Powder, Oregon near Idaho. He travelled an average of 22 miles per hour. He tied 105 large helium balloons to his lawn chair. Couch used plastic bags filled with 75 liters water as weight to balance the balloons. Couch had a BB gun to shoot the balloons and start going down on that first flight. He tried again and learned how to let helium out of the balloons and go down more carefully. On 5 July 2008, Couch finally reached his goal. He travelled to another state and landed his lawnchair in western Idaho. The trip was 240 miles and took 9 hours and 12 minutes.

On 20 April 2008 a Brazilian Roman Catholic priest Adelir Antonio de Carli flew using a chair and 1000 helium balloons. He did not check the weather forecast and got caught in a storm. He had a GPS but did not know how to use it. He crashed into the sea. The Brazilian navy found his body near an offshore oil platform on 4 July 2008. This unsuccessful flight won him a 2008 Darwin Award.

Many other people have tried flying with balloons the same way. Some may even have gone higher than Larry did.

Upper Jurassic

The Upper Jurassic, or Late Jurassic, is the last epoch of the Jurassic Period. It lasted from 161.2 ± 4.0 to 145.5 ± 4.0 million years ago, and is preserved in Upper Jurassic strata.

During the Upper Jurassic epoch, Pangaea broke up into two supercontinents, Laurasia to the north, and Gondwana to the south. The result of this break-up was the spawning of the Atlantic Ocean. However, at this time, the Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow.

Sea level was high, though not so high as during the Upper Cretaceous. The Laurasian landmass was broken up by the rising sea into large islands. The rocks were carbonate limestones and clays. The epoch included the famous Solnhofen limestone lagerstätte, where "Archaeopteryx" was found.

The Upper Jurassic is divided into three stages (later stages above earlier):

The Upper Jurassic of England and Europe bears a huge amount of the products of life. The Kimmeridge clay is the main source for the huge North Sea oil reserves, and the whole epoch is stuffed full of marine fossils. Many dinosaur remains have also been found. The epoch starts with the Oxford Clay deposited in a shallow seaway of 10 to 50 metres depth.

The first fossils which show small dinosaurs with feathers are found: "Anchiornis".

Hermannsdenkmal

The Statue of Herman ( Hermannsdenkmal) is a monument located in the Southern part of the Teutoburg Forest, in the district of Lippe, North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany.

The monument commemorates the Cherusci war chief Hermann or Armin (Latin: Arminius) and the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD when the Germanic tribes under Arminius fought three Roman legions and other troops under Varus. 

The sword has the following inscription:

The monument is 53.46 m (173.39 ft) tall and was built according to plans by the sculptor Ernst von Bandel.

Building for the statue was started in 1841, but was not finished until 1875 with the help of a lot of money from the state of Prussia. 

When building was started Germany was made up of lots of small countries. Most of these were united into the Second German Empire in 1871, after the Franco-Prussian War. The monument was seen as one of those heping to remind people of Germany's history and national pride.

The statue is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Germany with over 130,000 visitors a year. It is possible to climb up onto the base of the statue to look around the countryside

A similar Hermann Heights Monument exists in New Ulm, Minnesota, a town settled by German immigrants.

Mercury(II) bromide

Mercury(II) bromide, also known as mercuric bromide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is HgBr. It has mercury and bromide ions in it. The mercury is in its +2 oxidation state.

Mercury(II) bromide is a colorless solid. It is very toxic and similar to mercury(II) chloride. It can form explosive mixtures with potassium. It also reacts violently with indium at high temperatures. It is corrosive. 

It can be made by reacting mercury(II) oxide with hydrobromic acid or by disproportionation of mercury(I) bromide.

It is used as a reagent in a reaction in organic chemistry. It is also used to test for arsenic. The arsenic is reacted with hydrogen to make arsine, which reacts with mercury(II) bromide to turn it yellow or brown.

Philippe, Duke of Orléans, Regent of France

Philippe d'Orléans (2 August 1674 – 2 December 1723) was a member of the royal family of France and served as Regent of the Kingdom from 1715 to 1723. Born at his father's palace at Saint-Cloud, he was known from birth under the title of Duke of Chartres. His father was Louis XIV's younger brother Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, known as "Monsieur"; his mother was Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate. 

In 1692, Philippe married his first cousin, Françoise Marie de Bourbon - the youngest legitimised daughter ("légitimée de France") of Philippe's uncle Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. Named regent of France for Louis XV until Louis attained his majority in February 1723, the era of his "de facto" rule was known as the Regency (1715–1723). He died at Versailles in 1723. He is referred to historically as "le Régent".


Philippe also had several illegitimate children with several women, three of whom he acknowledged.

Philippe, Duke of Orléans

Philippe of France (21 September 1640 – 9 June 1701) was the youngest son of Louis XIII of France and his queen consort Anne of Austria. His older brother was the famous Louis XIV, "le roi soleil". 

Philippe de France was born at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Styled Duke of Anjou from birth, Philippe became Duke of Orléans upon the death of his uncle Gaston, Duke of Orléans. During the reign of his brother he was known simply as "Monsieur". Openly homosexual, he married twice: firstly to Henrietta of England, "Minette", sister of Charles II of England. During their marriage, Philippe met and began a relationship with the Chevalier de Lorraine who was the great love of Philippe's life, their long relationship beginning in 1668. After the alleged poisoning of Minette, Philippe married again in 1671 to Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, "Liselotte". 

He was the founder of the House of Orléans, a cadet branch of the ruling House of Bourbon, and thus the direct ancestor of Louis Philippe I, who ruled France from 1830 till 1848 in the July Monarchy. Through the children of both of his marriages Philippe became an ancestor of most modern-day Roman Catholic royals, giving him the nickname of "the grandfather of Europe". Philippe's other legacies include his decisive victory at the Battle of Cassel in 1677. Through careful personal administration, Philippe greatly augmented his fortune and thus the fortune of the House of Orléans.

Married Henrietta of England, daughter of Charles I of England and Henrietta Maria of France, on 31 March 1661, at the Palais Royal. The couple had three children:


Married Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, daughter of Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine and Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel, on 16 November 1671 at Châlons. The couple had three children:

Françoise Marie de Bourbon

Françoise Marie de Bourbon, "Légitimée de France" (4 May 1677 – 1 February 1749) was the youngest legitimised daughter ("fille légitimée de France") of Louis XIV of France and his maîtresse-en-titre, Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan. 

Originally known as the second "Mademoiselle de Blois", that style eventually gave way to the name "Françoise Marie de Blois". She married her first cousin Philippe d'Orléans in 18 February 1692 at the age of fourteen and later bore eight children, four of which would have further children.

Proud, lazy and attractive, she successfully intrigued to have her daughters marry well to the Prince of Conti, Duke of Berry, Duke of Modena and King of Spain, mostly to spite her sister Louise Françoise de Bourbon, the Duchess of Bourbon. However, she welded little political influence considering her proximity to the political circle of the era. She was involved in the Cellamare Conspiracy in 1718 which was supposed to overthrow her own husband Philippe d'Orléans as Regent of the Kingdom and replace him with her favourite brother the Duke of Maine. The "marquis d'Argenson" said she was very like her mother, Madame de Montespan, but also had Louis XIV's orderly mind with his failings of injustice and harshness.

Among her male line descendents are Philippe Egalité, Louis-Philippe I, King of the French, and Prince Henri, Count of Paris, the present Orléanist pretender to the French throne. She is also an ancestor of Juan Carlos I of Spain, Albert II, King of the Belgians, Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg and Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples, the pretender to the Italian throne.

Louis d'Orléans (4 August 1703 – 4 February 1752) was the Duke of Orléans and a "prince du sang". At his father's death, he became the First Prince of the Blood ("Premier Prince du Sang"). Known as "Louis le Pieux" and also as "Louis le Génovéfain", Louis was a pious, charitable and cultured prince, who took very little part in the politics of the time.

Louis d'Orléans was born at the Palace of Versailles in 1703 to Philippe II, Duke of Orléans and his wife, Françoise Marie de Bourbon, the youngest legitimised daughter of Louis XIV and of his mistress Madame de Montespan. At his birth, he was given the courtesy title of Duke of Chartres.

He was brought up by his mother and his grandmother, Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate. Louis was very close to his younger sister Louise Élisabeth d'Orléans. Upon the death of his father on 2 December 1723, he became Duke of Orléans. 

He married Johanna of Baden-Baden (1704–1726), the daughter of Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden and his wife Sibylle Auguste of Saxe-Lauenburg, on 18 June 1724. The couple were very happy but Joanne died in childbirth in 1726 and Louis mourned her intensely. He never remarried. 

He died in 1752, at the age of forty-eight, at the Abbaye de Sainte Geneviève, having lost most of his sanity. He was buried at the Val-de-Grâce in Paris.

Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans

Louis Philippe d'Orléans (12 May 1725 – 18 November 1785) was Duke of Orléans and the father of "Philippe Égalité". He greatly augmented the already huge wealth of the House of Orléans. 

"Louis Philippe d'Orléans" was born at the Palace of Versailles on 12 May 1725. As the only son of Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans and his wife Johanna of Baden-Baden. 

In 1743, his paternal grandmother, Françoise-Marie de Bourbon the formidable Dowager Duchess of Orléans, and Louise Élisabeth, Dowager Princess of Conti arranged his marriage to his seventeen-year old cousin, Louise Henriette de Bourbon. The couple was married on 17 December 1743 at Versailles.

After a few months of a passion that surprised everyone at court, the couple started to drift apart as the young Duchess of Chartres began to lead a scandalous life. 

After the death of Louise Henriette on 9 February 1759, Louis Philippe took as his mistress Étiennette Le Marquis, a former dancer who liked to act in comedy plays, and who introduced him into the world of the theater. Louis Philippe had three children with Étiennette, they were raised under the care of the Orléans family:


In spite of his liaison with Étiennette, Louis Philippe had several other mistresses until he met, in July 1766, Charlotte Jeanne Béraud de La Haye de Riou, "Madame de Montesson", a witty but married twenty-eight year old. After the death of the Marquis of Montesson in 1769, Louis Philippe tried to obtain Louis XV's authorisation to marry the young widow. Finally, in December 1772, the King gave his consent on the condition that the Marquise of Montesson would never become Duchess of Orléans or succeed to any other Orléans titles. In addition, the couple was to live a quiet life away from the court. The morganatic wedding took place on 23 April 1773. 

Surrounded by all the members of his immediate family, even his three children by Etiennette Le Marquis, Louis-Philippe died on 18 November 1785, at Sainte-Assise at the age of sixty. He was buried at the Val-de-Grâce convent in Paris, built by his ancestor Anne of Austria to celebrate the birth of Louis XIV of France, Louis Philippe's great grandfather.

Philippe Égalité

Louis Philippe Joseph d'Orléans (13 April 1747, – 6 November 1793) commonly known as "Philippe", was a member of the House of Orléans. He actively supported the French Revolution and adopted the name Philippe Égalité, but was still guillotined during the Reign of Terror. His son Louis Philippe became King of the French after the July Revolution of 1830. 

Louis Philippe Joseph d'Orléans was the son of Louis Philippe d'Orléans, Duke of Chartres, and Louise Henriette de Bourbon and was born at the Château de Saint Cloud. 

In November 1785, upon his father's death, Philippe, the new Duke of Orléans, became the head of the House of Orléans. This was one of the wealthiest families of France, and Premier Prince du Sang, addressed as "Monsieur le Prince", the most important person of the kingdom after the king's immediate family. He was next in line to the throne should the main Bourbon line die out.

On 6 June 1769, Louis Philippe married Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon at the Chapel of the Palace of Versailles. Louise Marie Adélaïde brought to the already wealthy House of Orléans a considerable dowry of six million livres, an annual income of 240,000 livres (later increased to 400,000 livres), as well as lands, titles, residences and furniture. They had five children:


During the first few months of their marriage, the couple appeared devoted to each other, but the duke went back to the life of "libertinage" he had led before his marriage. During the summer of 1772, a few months after his wife had given birth to a stillborn daughter, Philippe began a secret relationship with one of her ladies-in-waiting, Stéphanie Félicité Ducrest de St-Albin, comtesse de Genlis. Stephanie was the niece of Madame de Montesson his fathers second wife. 

In 1778, Philippe served in the squadron of the Count of Orvilliers. He was present in the Battle of Ushant, a naval battle against the British during the American War of Independence on 27 July 1778. He was removed from the navy due in part to the queen's hatred of him and also to his own incompetence and alleged cowardice. As compensation, he was given the honorary post of colonel-general of hussars.

The part Philippe d'Orléans played during the summer of 1789 is one of the most debated points in the history of the French Revolution. The royal court said he was at the bottom of every popular movement, and saw the ""gold of Orléans"" as the cause of the Réveillon riot and the storming of the Bastille. This was like the subsequent belief held by the Jacobins that everything opposing them relied on the ""gold of Pitt the Younger""). His hatred of Marie Antoinette, his previous disgrace at court, and his liberalism (alongside his friendship with Duport and Choderlos de Laclos), all seem to point towards his involvement. The Duke is also said to have deliberately withheld grain from the people of Paris, being a direct cause of the 5 October "March on Versailles". The Duke is also thought to have lied about where he was when the Palace at Versailles was stormed in the early hours of the morning on the 6th of October. He said he was at the General Assembly in Paris, yet several witness (including the Marquise de la Tour du Pin) saw him lead the bloodthirsty mob to a staircase leading to the Queen's bedroom, protected by Swiss Guard. The mob cried ""Long live our King d'Orléans"" during the raid.

The Marquis de La Fayette, apparently jealous of Philippe's popularity, persuaded the king to send the duke to Britain on a mission, where he remained in England from October 1789 to July 1790. On 7 July 1790, he took his seat in the National Constituent Assembly. On 2 October, both he and Honoré Mirabeau were declared by the Assembly entirely free of any involvement in the events of 5–6 October 1789.

Philippe d'Orléans tried to keep himself distant from the political world, but he was still suspect to the King and subject to pressures from his supporters to replace Louis XVI. His lack of political aspirations could be proven by noting that he did not attempt to obtain any leading position after the King's flight to Varennes in June 1791. In fact, Louis Philippe attempted to reconcile with the King in January 1792, but was rejected, and refused to aid the King any further. In an attempt to show his support of democratic and Enlightenment philosophies, he changed his name to Philippe "Citoyen Egalité", meaning equality.

In the summer of 1792, he was present for a short time with the Army of the North, together with his two sons, the Duke of Chartres, future King of the French, and the Duke of Montpensier, but had returned to Paris before the insurrection of 10 August.

After the fall of the monarchy, Philippe risked his own life by saving suspects of the revolutionary regime. At the request of Grace Elliott, he saved the life of Louis René Quentin de Richebourg de Champcenetz, the governor of the Tuileries Palace, who was his personal enemy. He accepted the title "Citoyen Égalité" given to him by the Commune. He was elected 20th and last deputy for Paris to the National Convention, where he again made no notable contribution other than voting in the king's trial. He voted in support of the death sentence for Louis XVI. Many citizens of Paris saw this as an attempt by Philippe to overthrow the crown and take power himself. They believed that not only was the Palais-Royal the center for revolutionary and philosophical debates, but that it was also his ground for recruiting and financing riots and rebellious activity.

As a member of the House of Bourbon, Louis Philippe was shortlisted for a trial, and effectively tried and guillotined in the space of one day on 6 November 1793. Accounts of his time in prison and execution mention his exceptional courage.

Philippe d'Orléans was buried in the "Madeleine cemetery" (closed in 1794), in Paris, where Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and hundreds executed on the "Place de la Révolution" during the Terror had been buried. His remains have never never found.

A Dangerous Path (Warriors)

A Dangerous Path is the fifth book in the "Warriors" series by Erin Hunter. This book, and some following books in this series, takes place in the New Forest, in Great Britain. However some mountains have been added as the real New Forest has no mountains around it.

Fireheart continues to struggle to care for ThunderClan, one of the warrior Clans in the forest, as Tigerstar tries to destroy ThunderClan. Bluestar is no help at all, because she is still insane from Tigerstar's previous betrayal. Tigerstar has plans of his own; this time to use a pack of dogs. He hunts rabbits in ThunderClan territory, and leaves a trail from Snakerocks to the ThunderClan camp, with Brindleface at the end. Once Fireheart discovers this, he takes ThunderClan to Sunningrocks. A patrol of fast warriors lead the dogs to their deaths in the gorge (a hole that extends wide, with water at the bottom). Fireheart is the last in line, and has a good lead until Tigerstar leaps out of nowhere and holds Fireheart down, letting the dogs get very close, before letting him go. Fireheart gets trapped in the lead dog's mouth, but is rescued by Bluestar. She bowls over the lead dog, who in turn releases Fireheart, and the two go down into the gorge. Fireheart saves Bluestar and brings her to the shore, where she eventually dies. Fireheart is filled with sadness for his leader.

Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., (; November 11, 1922 – April 11, 2007) was an American writer. He influenced many other writers. He combined satire, black comedy, and science fiction in his writing. Some of his works include "Slaughterhouse-Five" (1969), "Cat's Cradle" (1963), and "Breakfast of Champions" (1973). He was known for his humanist beliefs and was honorary president of the American Humanist Association.

Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. His parents were Kurt Vonnegut, Sr., and Edith Lieber. He was the youngest of three children. His ancestors had come to America from Germany in 1855. They were prosperous, originally as brewers and merchants. Both his father and his grandfather attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology and were architects in the Indianapolis firm of Vonnegut & Bohn. His great-grandfather was the founder of the Vonnegut Hardware Company, an Indianapolis institution.

Vonnegut graduated from Shortridge High School in Indianapolis in May 1940. He went to Cornell University that autumn. He studied Chemistry, but he was Assistant Managing Editor and Associate Editor of the university newspaper called "The Cornell Daily Sun". He was a member of the Delta Upsilon Fraternity just like his father. Vonnegut joined the U.S. Army while he was at Cornell. The Army transferred him to the Carnegie Institute of Technology and the University of Tennessee to study Mechanical Engineering. On Mothers' Day in 1944, his mother committed suicide with sleeping pills.

Kurt Vonnegut's experience as a soldier and prisoner of war (POW) had a deep and powerful effect on his writing. During the war, he was a soldier with a low rank. He was a private with the 423rd Infantry Regiment, 106th Infantry Division. Vonnegut was captured during the Battle of the Bulge on December 19, 1944. He was in prison in the German city of Dresden. He became a leader among the prisoners because he could speak German a little bit. But, he told German guards "...just what I was going to do to them when the Russians came…". The guards beat Vonnegut and stopped him from being a leader. He experienced the fire bombing of Dresden in February 1945 which destroyed most of the city.

Vonnegut's group of American prisoners of war survived the attack. The Germans had kept them in an underground room for storing meat at a slaughterhouse. The Germans called the building "Schlachthof Fünf" (Slaughterhouse Five) and the Allied POWs used that name for their prison. Vonnegut said the result of the attack was complete destruction and death that nobody could understand. This experience gave him ideas for his famous novel, "Slaughterhouse-Five". His experience of death and destruction is a central theme in at least six of his other books. In "Slaughterhouse-Five" he described the city as looking like the surface of the moon after the bombing. He told about how the Germans making the prisoners work. They had to break into basements and bomb shelters to gather bodies. They had to bury these dead people all together in large holes while German people threw rocks at them and shouted curses. Vonnegut said later, "There were too many corpses to bury. So instead the Germans sent in troops with flamethrowers. All these civilians' remains were burned to ashes."

Vonnegut was freed by Red Army troops in May 1945 at the Saxony-Czechoslovakian border. The U. S. Army gave him a Purple Heart. But he said it was funny because he was not hurt badly at all. He wrote in "Timequake" that he was given the award for getting "frostbite".

After the war, Vonnegut became an anthropology graduate student at the University of Chicago. He also worked at the City News Bureau of Chicago. Vonnegut admitted that he was a not a good student. One professors said that some of the students were going to be professional anthropologists but he was not one of them. In the book "Bagombo Snuff Box", Vonnegut wrote that the university rejected his first thesis. It was about Cubist painters and the leaders of Native American uprisings. The university said it was "unprofessional."

He moved from Chicago to Schenectady, New York. He worked in public relations for General Electric. His brother Bernard worked in the research department at the same company. While in Schenectady, Vonnegut lived in a tiny village called Alplaus. Vonnegut rented an upstairs apartment across the street from the Alplaus Volunteer Fire Department. He was an active Volunteer Fire-Fighter for a few years. That apartment still has his desk in it. He wrote many of his short stories at that desk carved his name into the bottom of it. The University of Chicago later accepted his novel "Cat's Cradle" as his thesis because they said the story was anthropological. They gave him an M.A. degree in 1971.

In the mid 1950s, Vonnegut worked for "Sports Illustrated" magazine for a very short time. He was asked to write about a racehorse that had jumped a fence and tried to run away. Vonnegut stared at the blank piece of paper on his typewriter all morning. Then, he typed, "The horse jumped over the fucking fence," and left. He was almost going to quit writing, but the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop asked him to teach. While he was there, "Cat's Cradle" became a best-seller, and he began "Slaughterhouse-Five". That book is now called one of the best American novels of the 20th century. It is on the 100 best lists of "Time" magazine and the Modern Library. In 1961, he published the famous short story Harrison Bergeron.

Vonnegut moved to Barnstable, Massachusetts, a town on Cape Cod. He was the manager the first Saab dealership in the U.S.

After coming home from World War II, Kurt Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox. They had loved each other since they were very young. He wrote about their early relationship in several of his short stories. The couple separated in 1970. He did not divorce Cox until 1979, but from 1970 Vonnegut lived with another woman, the photographer Jill Krementz. She became his second wife after Vonnegut divorced Cox.

He raised seven children. Three were from his first marriage to Cox. He adopted one daughter named Lily with Krementz. Three were his sister Alice's children. Vonnegut adopted them after she died of cancer. 

Of Vonnegut's four adopted children, three are his nephews: James, Steven, and Kurt Adams. Vonnegut adopted them after a terrible week in 1958. During that week the childrens' father James Carmalt Adams was killed in a train crash and their mother died two days later. In his novel "Slapstick", Vonnegut told how Alice's husband had died two days before she did. Her family tried to keep her husband's death a secret. However, she found out when another patient gave her a newspaper one day before she died. The three boys had a younger brother named Peter Nice. He was a baby when their parents died. Peter went to live with their father's cousin in Birmingham, Alabama.

On January 31, 2001, a fire destroyed the top story of Vonnegut's home. He had smoke inhalation and was in the hospital in critical condition for four days. He survived, but his personal papers were destroyed.

Vonnegut smoked unfiltered Pall Mall cigarettes. He called this habit a "classy way to commit suicide".

Vonnegut fell down at his home in Manhattan and injured his brain. He died on April 11, 2007.

Hamiltonian

Hamiltonian mechanics is a mathematical way of understanding the way something mechanical will behave. It was invented in 1833 by Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton.

The value of the Hamiltonian is the total energy of the thing being described. For a closed system, it is the sum of its kinetic and potential energy. There will be a set of differential equations known as the Hamilton equations which show how the thing changes through time . 

Hamiltonians can be used to describe such simple systems as a bouncing ball, a pendulum or an oscillating spring in which energy changes between kinetic and potential energy and back again over time. Hamiltonians can also be used to study the orbits of planets and in the behaviour of atoms using the principles of quantum mechanics.

Bathilde d'Orléans

Bathilde d'Orléans (Louise Marie Thérèse Bathilde;9 July 1750 – 10 January 1822), was a French princess. She was sister of Philippe Égalité, the mother of the executed "duc d'Enghien" and aunt of Louis-Philippe King of the French. She was known as "Citoyenne Vérité" during the French Revolution.

Descended from both Louis XIV of France and his younger brother, Philippe of France, "Duke of Orléans", Bathilde was born a "princesse du sang" and baptised with the names "Louise Marie Thérèse Bathilde". She was the youngest child of Louis Philippe d'Orléans and Louise Henriette de Bourbon. Bathilde was born at the Château de Saint-Cloud on 9 July 1750. 

Her mother died in 1759 when Bathilde was just eight years old. Her father, pressured by his mistress, Madame de Montesson, sent her to a convent. During her time at the convent, she became a very spiritual person.

Initially, Bathilde was considered as a possible bride for a distant cousin, Ferdinand, Duke of Parma, the favourite grandson of King Louis XV of France, however, that marriage never materialised.

Finally, in 1770, when she was twenty years old, she was allowed to leave the convent and marry her younger cousin, the "Louis Henri de Bourbon", son and heir of Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Condé and his wife Charlotte Élisabeth Godefride de Rohan. 

The scandal of her husband's adultery came out in 1778, and the consequences fell entirely on her shoulders. The couple separated in 1780. As a separated spouse, she was never received at court and was forced to reorganise her life at the Château de Chantilly. 

In her isolation, she discreetly had an illegitimate daughter with a marine officer. Later, she passed the child off as the daughter of her secretary, in order to keep the little girl close to her. In 1787, she purchased the Élysée Palace from Louis XVI and had a hamlet constructed there.

During the French Revolution, just like her brother Philippe Égalité, Bathilde discovered democracy. She fell out with her royalist husband and son, who both chose to leave France after the storming of the Bastille. As the "Ancien Régime" crumbled, she took the name, "Citoyenne Vérité", "Citizeness Truth". Threatened by the new revolutionary government, she offered her wealth to the First French Republic before it could be confiscated.

In April 1793, her nephew, the young Duke of Chartres (future Louis Philippe of the French), fled France and sought asylum with the Austrians. In retribution, the National Convention decreed the imprisonment of all Bourbons remaining in France. While other members of the Orléans family still in France were kept under house arrest, Bathilde, Philippe Égalité and his sons were imprisoned in the Fort Saint-Jean in Marseille. Badly rewarded for her fidelity to the democratic ideals of the Revolution, she survived a year and a half in a prison cell. In November of the same year, her brother was guillotined. Miraculously spared during the Reign of Terror, Bathilde was freed during the Thermidorian Reaction and returned to her Élysée residence in Paris. Poverty-stricken, she was forced to rent out most of the palace.

In 1797, the Directoire decided to exile the last of the Bourbons still living in France. With her sister-in-law, Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon, she went to Spain with her illegitimate daughter. Despite being forty-seven years old at the time, during the months which this journey took, she had an amorous intrigue with a handsome twenty-seven year old police officer ("gendarme") under whose responsibility she had been put. The two maintained a correspondence during her exile.

Relegated to a place near Barcelona, Bathilde founded, despite her small means, a pharmacy and dispensary for the poor, and her house became a gathering place for those who needed aid. She became completely republican during this time period, despite her exile.

In 1804, she learned that Napoléon I, whom she admired, had had her only son, Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien, kidnapped, and executed by firing squad in the moat of the Château de Vincennes. For ten years, the emperor kept the mother of his most famous victim from setting foot in France. Bathilde got her revenge in 1814, when the people, seeing in her the mother of the "Martyr of Vincennes," cheered her as she travelled the route back to Paris.

In 1815, at the start of the Bourbon Restoration, she returned to France. Louis XVIII traded with her the Hôtel Matignon for the Élysée Palace. Bathilde promptly installed a community of nuns on the premises and charged them with praying for the souls of the victims of the Revolution. Her family, in the new moral order of the day, wanted to see her rejoin her husband after a separation of thirty-five years, but she refused. Instead, she resumed her affair with the police officer who had escorted her to Spain in 1797. 

In 1822, while she was taking part in a march towards the Panthéon, she lost consciousness, and drew her last breath in the home of a law professor who taught at the Sorbonne. After her death, her nephew, Louis-Philippe, wanting to give an air of respectability to her bohemian lifestyle, burned the manuscript of her memoirs and a file on her young police officer located in the war archives. 

She was buried in the Orléans family chapel the Collégiale de Dreux.

Basin (geology)

A geological basin is a large low-lying area. It is often below sea level.

Geological basins are one of the two most common places inland which collect sediment, the other being lakes. The type of rocks which form there tell about the palaeoclimate of the continent. The geology is of interest to both oil companies and palaeontologists.


Starting around 16 million years ago in the Miocene, and continuing into the present, a large part of the North American Plate has been stretched by being pulled apart. The result has been the creation of a large and still-growing region of relatively thin crust; the region grew an average of per year initially and then slowed to per year in the last 5 million years. Geologists call this region the Basin and Range Province.

Pulling forces causes rock at depth to stretch like silly putty and rock closer to the surface to break along normal faults into downfallen basins called grabens.

Because the basin is low-lying, it collects sediment. Rivers may run down into the basin from surrounding mountains. Floods or lakes may form with no outlet to the sea. Evaporation occurs; more sediment arrives, and so on. The strata which forms gives clues as to the palaeoclimate.

Other terms that are used to describe a basin are: "drainage basin", "catchment", "catchment area", "catchment basin", "drainage area", "river basin", "water basin" and "watershed".

Many basins drain through (usually) slow-moving tropical rivers into the sea. These rivers meander through a web of islands at the river delta (estuary), and bring along a huge amount of sediment in the form of mud, clay and sand, into the sea. The Amazon and the Mississippi river systems are like this. The strata which form are quite different from inland basin lakes.

Auger electron spectroscopy

Auger electron spectroscopy is a way of telling what chemical elements are at the surface of an object.

When an electron is removed from a core level of an atom, a higher energy level electron may fall in the vacancy. If the energy released by the fall is transferred to another electron, the latter (called Auger electron) will be emitted from the atom, in what is called the Auger effect, after the French physicist who discovered the phenomenon, Pierre Auger. The kinetic energy levels of the Auger electrons depend on the type of the atoms from which the electrons were ejected, and the chemical environment of the atoms. AES consists of bombarding a sample with energetic electrons and measuring the energy of the Auger electrons, obtaining a spectra that can be used to get information about the identity and environment of the emitting atoms.

Lee Joseph Fogolin (born February 7, 1955 in Chicago, Illinois and raised in Thunder Bay, Ontario), is a retired defenceman who played in the National Hockey League. He played for the Buffalo Sabres and the Edmonton Oilers, playing in 924 NHL regular season games between 1974 and 1987, winning the Stanley Cup in 1984 and 1985. 

Fogolin was born in Chicago while his father, Lee Fogolin Sr., was a member of the Chicago Blackhawks. His son, Michael Fogolin, played for the Prince George Cougars in the WHL and died in his sleep on May 26, 2004 of a possible heart condition.

Fogolin played from 1972–1974 with the Oshawa Generals of the OHA, scoring 52 points in 102 games with 240 PIM. He was drafted in the first round, 11th overall, of the 1974 NHL Entry Draft by the Buffalo Sabres. 

Although Fogolin was raised in Canada, he was chosen to play for Team USA in the 1976 Canada Cup, since he was born in the U.S.. He was invited again in 1984, but this time chose not to play.

Fogolin played his first professional season (1974–75) in Buffalo, but played parts of the next season with the Sabres and the AHL Hershey Bears. He was acquired by the Edmonton Oilers for the 1979–1980 season. 

Fogolin played seven full seasons with Edmonton, and was named as captain for the 1981–82 season. He would be the first of four captains to lead the Oilers to the Stanley Cup finals, in 1983, where they lost to the New York Islanders. While a solid defenceman in his own right, he was overshadowed by many of the young stars on the Oilers' roster, most notably scoring superstar Wayne Gretzky. Fogolin gave up the captaincy to Gretzky for the 1983–84 season onwards. Fogolin was a member of the Oilers' Stanley Cup wins in 1984 and 1985. Fogolin also played in the 1986 National Hockey League All-Star Game. 

Fogolin was re-acquired by the Sabres near the end of the 1986–87 season, and retired after completing the season with them.

Marie Thérèse of Austria

Marie Thérèse of Austria (María Teresa; 10 September 1638 – 30 July 1683) was the daughter of Philip IV, King of Spain and Elisabeth of France. She was Queen of France as wife of King Louis XIV and mother of "Le Grand Dauphin". During her lifetime in Spain, she was painted by the renowned painter, Diego Velázquez. Married to Louis XIV in 1660 following the Franco-Spanish War she played little part in politics during her lifetime. The Bourbon Claim to the Spanish Throne which sparked of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1700 stems from her. 

Born María Teresa, she was the only surviving daughter of Philip IV, King of Spain and Elisabeth of France. By birth she was she was an Infanta of Spain, Portugal and Archduchess of Austria and member of the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg. 

María Teresa, Infanta of Spain and Archduchess of Austria married Louis XIV of France by proxy on 3 June 1660 at Fuenterrabia. Her father Philip IV and the entire Spanish court accompanied the María Teresa to the Isle of Pheasants in Bidassoa, where Louis XIV and his court met her. On 7 June 1660, she departed from her native country of Spain. On 9 June she married Louis XIV in a religious ceremony at Saint-Jean-de-Luz in the "Saint Jean Baptiste" church, which had recently been rebuilt for the occasion. Known as Marie Thérèse d'Autriche, she had a six children with Louis XIV but he would never love her. Marie Thérèse lived a quiet life with her Spanish attendants and had to put up with her husbands various affairs, notably with Louise de La Vallière and Madame de Monstespan. 

During the last week of July 1683, Marie Thérèse fell ill. Marie Thérèse, Archduchess of Austria and Infanta of Spain by birth died a painful death on 30 July 1683 at Versailles in the arms of Madame de Maintenon. She was buried at the Royal Basilica of Saint Denis outside Paris on 3 September 1683. Her tomb was destroyed during the French Revolution.

Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Burgundy

Louis of France (16 August 1682 – 18 February 1712) was the eldest son of Louis, Dauphin of France, known as "le Grand Dauphin" and, as such, was known as "le Petit Dauphin". He became Dauphin of France upon his father's death in 1711.

Louis de France was born in the Palace of Versailles, the eldest son of Louis, "le Grand Dauphin", and his wife Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria. At birth, he received the title of Duke of Burgundy.

Louis grew up with his younger brothers; Philippe, Duke of Anjou and Charles, Duke of Berry. 

At the age of 15, he married his second cousin, Marie Adélaïde of Savoy, the daughter of Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy and Anne Marie d'Orléans. This match had been decided as part of the Treaty of Turin, which ended Franco-Savoyard conflicts during the Nine Years' War. The marriage took place on 7 December 1697 at the Palace of Versailles. The two were in love with one another, a rarity at the court of Versailles.

Louis became Dauphin of France upon the death of his father in 1711. 

In February 1712, his wife contracted measles and died on the 12th of that month. 

The Duke of Burgundy, who dearly loved his wife and who had stayed by her side throughout the fatal illness, contracted the disease and died on 18 February, six days after her at the Château de Marly. Both of his sons also became infected, the eldest, Louis, Duke of Brittany, the latest in a series of Dauphins, succumbed to it on 8 March. The only one to survive was the two-year old Duke of Anjou, the future King Louis XV of France.

Dauphin of France

The Dauphin was the heir apparent to the throne of France from 1350–1791, and from 1824–1830. 

Guy VIII, Count of Vienne, had a dolphin on his coat of arms and had been nicknamed "le Dauphin" (French for "dolphin"). The title of Dauphin of Viennois descended in his family until 1349, when Humbert II sold his signeurie, called the Dauphiné, to King Philippe VI on condition that the heir of France assumed the title of "le Dauphin". The wife of the Dauphin was known as the "Dauphine". The first French Dauphin was Charles V. The title is roughly equivalent to the English title "Prince of Wales".

The title of "Dauphin of Auvergne" was used by the Count of Clermont.

Plague mask

The Plague mask was created and used when the plague came to London to stop docters catching the plague. It was a crude gas mask in the shape of a bird's beak. A common idea at the time was that the plague was spread by bad air. There could have been a belief that by dressing in a bird mask, the docter could move the plague away from the patient and onto the clothes the plague doctor wore. The mask also had red glass eyes, which were thought to make it so the wearer could not be harmed by evil. The beak of the mask was often filled with herbs and spices to make the bad air smell better. Even though the mask did not work like it should have, it may have made the smell of unburied bodys and plague victims smell better.

Puzzle Bobble 2

Bust-A-Move 2 is the first sequel to "Bust-A-Move", and is also known as Puzzle Bobble 2 outside Europe and North America. Released into the arcades in 1995, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64 and PC conversions followed. The game was included in Taito Legends 2, but the US arcade version was included on US PS2 version instead. The game is a spin-off from Bubble Bobble.

The game builds on the original by adding a tournament style variation on the two player game for play against the computer and by adding a branching map to the one player game, allowing the player to periodically select one of two groups of five levels to play next, leading to different game endings. Some of the contestants in the new tournament mode are based on characters from Bubble Bobble, including variations on a "Monsta" and a "Mighta".

Some versions of the game, including the PlayStation, feature time trial competitions in which a single player attempts to finish simple rounds quickly enough to beat previous time records or two players simultaneously attempt to beat the records and each other.

Completion of the single player game gives the player a code which can be entered to unlock 'Another World' for the single player game, which features subtle changes to the existing levels to increase their difficulty and changes to all backdrops to resemble levels from Bubble Bobble. The various enemies from Bubble Bobble also make an appearance in the background of the credits sequence.

Taito later repacked Bust-A-Move 2 with an optional alternative set of levels and some new attract mode animations (including holiday-themed ones) as "Bust-A-Move 2X" (Also known as Puzzle Bobble 2X).

Ports of Bust-A-Move 2 to the PC and Sega Saturn are of Bust-A-Move 2X and additionally include a level editor/designer. A port of 2X was made to the PlayStation but was not released until some time after a port of Bust-A-Move 2 was released; therefore, it is not so well known.

This game has become notorious for one version of its cover art. The original US version of the Saturn edition featured a picture of several large balls with screaming, blue, human faces with white sticks forcing their eyes open. This cover earned it a place on Gamespy.com's Top Ten Worst Covers list.

<doc id="275121" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275121" title="W and Z bosons">
W and Z bosons

W and Z bosons are some of the least understood elementary particles. Both are bosons, which means that they have a spin of 0 or 1. W bosons have been found in experiments, but Z bosons have not been found. Because of this, Z bosons are theoretical. Together, they are responsible for a force known as "weak force." Weak force was called weak because it is was not predicted to be very strong compared to other forces like electromagnetism. There are two W bosons with different charges, the normal W, and its antiparticle, the W . Z bosons are their own antiparticle.

W bosons are named after the weak force that they are responsible for. The naming of the Z boson is still uncertain, although it is believed to have been the last particle on a list that a lab that named it was looking for. Weak force is what physicists believe is responsible for the breaking down of some radioactive elements, in the form of Beta decay. In the late '70s, scientists managed to combine weak force and electromagnetism, and called it the electroweak force.

W and Z bosons are only known to be created under Beta decay, which is a form of radioactive decay.

Beta decay occurs when there are a lot of neutrons in an atom. An easy way to think of a neutron is that it is made of one proton and one electron. When there are too many neutrons in one atom nucleus, one neutron will split and form a proton and an electron. The proton will stay where it is, and the electron will be launched out of the atom at incredible speed. This is why Beta radiation is harmful to humans.

The above model is not entirely accurate, as both protons and neutrons are each made of three quarks. (A quark is a very small particle that is believed to be among the smallest particles in existence, and so it is not made of any smaller particles). A proton is made of two up quarks (which each have a charge of +2/3), and one down quark (which has a charge of -1/3). This is why a proton has a charge of +1. A neutron is made of one up quark and two down quarks, which is why its charge is 0. Up quarks and down quarks are two of the six types of quarks. These six types are known in the scientific world as flavours

Weak force is believed to be able to change the flavour of a quark. For example, when it changes a down quark in a neutron into to an up quark, the charge of the neutron becomes +1, since it would have the same arrangement of quarks as a proton. The three-quark neutron with a charge of +1 is no longer a neutron after this, as it fulfills all of the requirements to be a proton. Therefore, Beta decay will cause a neutron to become a proton (along with some other end-products). 

When a quark changes flavour, as it does in Beta decay, it releases a W boson. W bosons only last for 3x10 seconds, which is why we had not discovered them until less than half a century ago. Surprisingly, W bosons have a mass of about 80 times that of a proton (one proton weighs one atomic mass unit). Keep in mind that the neutron that it came from also only weighs one atomic mass unit. In the quantum world, it is not an extremely uncommon occurrence for a more massive particle to come from a less massive particle because it lasts less time than Planck's constant. (Planck's constant is simply a convenient number that falls out of the math when calculating this). After the 3x10 seconds has passed, a W boson decays into one electron and one neutrino. Since neutrinos rarely interact with matter, we can ignore them from now on. The electron is propelled out of the atom at a high speed. The proton that was produced by the Beta decay stays in the atom nucleus, and raises the atomic number by one. 

Z bosons are theoretical, and have not been found in a lab. Their existence is predicted in the Standard Model of physics, which successfully predicted the existence of W bosons. If Z bosons were found, they are believed to decay into a fermion (a particle with a spin of 1/2), and an antifermion (a fermion's antiparticle).

J/ψ mesons (pronounced jeɪ/saɪ, English jay/sigh) are subatomic particles made of one charm quark and one charm antiquark. Mesons are a family of composite particles which are made of one quark and one antiquark. The discovery of J/ψ mesons was huge because it revealed the existence of the fourth known quark of the time, the charm quark. J/ψ mesons were used in an attempt to learn more about quark-gluon plasmas, but no conclusive results were found. The name J/ψ comes from the chosen names from the two labs that found them, one of which chose the letter J, while the other chose the greek letter ψ (psi).

Toxic shock syndrome

Toxic shock syndrome is a non-common, deadly infection where bacteria causes an infection.

Often toxic shock syndrome comes from toxins made by staph bacteria, but the infection may also be caused by toxins made by strep bacteria.

While the infection often occurs in women, it can also affect men and children.

Symptoms of toxic shock syndrome can show up suddenly, and the disease can be deadly. You can take steps to reduce your risk of toxic shock syndrome.

The symptoms of toxic shock syndrome may include:

A sudden high fever 

Low blood pressure

Vomiting or diarrhea 

A rash that looks like a sunburn, particularly on your palms and soles — which, after a week or so, generally leads to peeling of the skin on your hands and feet 

Confusion 

Muscle aches 

Redness of your eyes, mouth and throat 

Seizures 

Headaches

Toxic shock syndrome can recur. People who've had it once can get it again.

Charles Blanvillain

Charly B, born Charles Blanvillain in 1981, is a French reggae artist, author, composer, interpreter, performing internationally..

Born in Rome, Italy from a family of musicians, he is from French, German and Armenian origins. At the age of 4 he moves to Geneva (Switzerland) where he spends most of his childhood. Music is then everything to him, and he discovers reggae at the age of 15, when he spends one year in Jamaica at IONA High School, hosted in a Jamaican family, having obtained a scholarship from the American Field Service. Later on, after passing his international baccalaureate, he studies sound techniques at the School of Recording Arts, Canada and at the Sound and Audio Engineering School in Geneva, Switzerland.
He starts to be interested in Reggae music very early, and at the age of 15, he composes his first song. His musical studies in Canada, long stays in Jamaica, and time spent living in France near the Swiss border form the cultural triumvirate from which Charly B draws his artistic vision. He has been singing with legends of dancehall like Capleton, Kiprich, De Marco and Anthony B.

In 2002, at the age of 21, he wins the first prize for the best Geneva (Switzerland) Singjay In 2003, he writes a song for the movie Destination Jamaica by George Tait (Jungle George) In 2004, his song "My Queen" appears in the DVD sold with the Austrian surfers' magazine Methodmag, published in 60,000 copies. In 2005 he wins the 1st prize for best Singjay in Switzerland organized by Giddeon Productions Unfortunately, he cannot take advantage of the prize (concert on the main stage of Rototom Sunsplash Festival 2005) in Italy, as he is expected in Jamaica that summer, and therefore gives his prize to the number 2 in the competition, Elijah. In 2007, Eliane Dambre from the Ateliers du Funambule sponsored by Michel Fugain, which studios are based in Nyon, decides to present his candidacy to the Eurovision for Switzerland , against DJ Bobo to represent Switzerland, but his candidacy is too late to be retained. More recently, in 2009, he has won the price for the best reggae song at the competition organized by Reggae Europe. He has deposited to SACEM over 100 titles entirely composed by him (music and lyrics), in French, English and Jamaican patois.
In summer 2009, he makes what he calls "a crucial encounter" with the producer Jon Baker, and records at Geejam Studios his album Forever, which will be released in 2011 under the label Geejam Recordings/ Forward Recordings. This encounter with Jon Baker is very important for the artist; the British producer (a friend of Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records), has discovered many talents, among which recently the reggae singer Alborosie and The Jolly Boys. Moreover, he gains the confidence of Reggae Europe who partners with Geejam Recordings for the album Forever. 

At the end of 2009, he is invited in Germany (Leipzig) to meet with Pionear from Germaican records then invited by Stylordz in Toronto and New York for the anniversary of Zulu Nation. In Toronto he shoots the clip of the song "Ooh No". In 2010, invited by the CAMA Festival in Hanoï, Vietnam, he makes a Vietnam tour (Hanoï and Ho Chi Minh City) and upon his return, attends the ROTOTOM Sunsplash Festival in August 2010. He is travelling between Jamaica and France, working on his last album Forever, which will be released in 2011.

Setsubun

Setsubun is a traditional event in Japan and it celebrates the end of winter and the beginning of spring. It takes place on February 3 or 4 and there are a lot of ways to celebrate the day. People take part in a traditional "mame-maki" ceremony. We throw roasted soybeans ("mame") and shout ‘‘"Oni wa Soto Fuku wa Uti"’’(Get out Ogre! Come in Happiness!). After the ceremony, each person eat the number of beans as same as their age to get happiness in the coming year. Other traditional custom is putting a head of sardine and "hiiragi" on the door to get rid of "Oni". In addition, people eat "Nori Maki" (a special "sushi" roll) with facing ‘’lucky direction’’ and not saying a word in "Kansai" area.

Setsubun means “division of the seasons” in the literal sense. In ancient times the beginning of each season was called Setsubun. On the Setsubun day, various rituals were conducted to drive away devil’s sprits. Nowadays, however, Setsubun only refers to "Risshun" (beginning of spring) because the day is the most important than the other Setsubun day since the day is a new year’s day in lunar calendar.It is said that both of beans and rice have spiritual power in it, and to throw these things is a good way to drive demons from our own and our house.People used to throw rice in ancient time, but people started to throw beans instead of rice since Chinese folkway was introduced. Since then, people throw beans to drive demons on Setsubun day.
As we said above, people usually eat an "Ehomaki", which is a kind of "makizushi", on Setsubun. "Makizushi" means “call over happiness”. We usually eat it without cutting because if we cut it, it implies “break up”. People usually put 7 kinds of ingredients in it after the Seven Gods of Fortune. 
We eat it without saying anything. Generally, it’s because it would be rudeness for the Seven Gods of Fortune if we are talking while we eat it, but anyone doesn’t know the fact.

"Setsubun" means separating seasons, and indicated each day before the first day of spring, summer, autumn and winter.
However, the event "Setsubun" is very famous, so it became the word to indicate the day before the first day of spring
only.
Setsubun was a ceremony to drive of ancient China and gods who brought misfortune. Originally, it was the folk event 
to hope talisman and good crop of private sector. This ceremony came down to Japan in the "Nara" era. 
In the "Hiean" era, "Tsuina" that the event of New Year's Eve held in the palace, changed into the ceremony to drive demons.
It died out in the "Muromachi" era, but the event gradually spread among commoner and remained as "Mamemaki" of Setsubun.
In the evening of Setsubun, people set up branches of holly with sardine at the entrance of house, and scatter parched beans. 
However, nowadays households which adorn with them decreased, and only scatter parched beans.
In the meantime, "Ehomaki" started as a custom to pray for te prosperous business at the harbor of "Osaka" in the end of "Edo" era. The custom died out temporarily, but "Osaka Nori Kyodo Kumiai" revived it in the event of "Dotonbori" in the late 1970's. Therefore, it was famous in the "Kansai" district. Also, it began to sell in the part of supermarkets and convenience stores in 1990's. In addition, it became rapidly popular among the whole country because "Ehomaki" was advertised considerably in stores.

There are a lot of events related to Setsubun in big shrines. For example, "Narita-san Shinsho-ji" in "Chiba" holds on big events every year. Some believers of "Toshi-otoko" (a man who was born in a year with the same sign of the Chinese zodiac as the current year.) or big names are invited to the event and they perform "mame-maki" ceremony to gather people. Because of the bad economy in Japan, these events are crowed with a lot of people who try to call in happiness.

Komodo National Park

The Komodo National Park is a national park in Indonesia. It is on several islands in the Lesser Sunda Islands. The park is in the area between the East Nusa Tenggara and West Nusa Tenggara provinces. The park includes three larger islands: Komodo, Padar and Rincah. It also includes 26 smaller ones for a total area of 1,733 km² (603 km² of it land). The national park was founded in 1980 to protect the Komodo dragon. This animal is the world's largest lizard. Later it began protecting other species, including some in the ocean. In 1991 the national park was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The park is spread over several islands. It includes part of western coast of Flores, the three larger islands of Komodo, Padar, Rincah, and 26 smaller islands. It also includes ocean areas such as the Sape Straights. The islands of the national park are volcanic. The land is generally rugged, with some rounded hills to 735m. The climate is one of the driest of Indonesia. Each year between 800mm and 1000mm of rain falls in the park area. Temperatures in the dry season from May to October are around 40°C.
The Park is hot and dry. There are many savannah plants that make it a good place for the Komodo dragon.

Cloud forests are in only a few areas above 500 metres. These forests are good places for some local plants. There are mangrove forests in some of the quiet bays of the three larger islands. 

Large and complex coral reefs are along the north-east coast of Komodo. The park has many animals that live in the ocean, including whale sharks, ocean sunfish, manta rays, eagle rays, pygmy seahorse, false pipefish, clown frogfish, nudibranchs, blue-ringed octopus, sponges, tunicates, and coral.

The island of Padar and part of Rinca were made nature reserves in 1938. Komodo Island became a nature reserve in 1965. UNESCO also began to protect the island in 1977. The three islands were named a national park in 1980. The park was extended to include the nearby parts of the ocean and a part of Flores in 1984. In 1991 the national park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since 1995, the national park authority has been supported by an American environmental organization called The Nature Conservancy (TNC). 

Komodo National Park has been selected as one of 28 finalists to become one of the New7Wonders of Nature.

About 4,000 people live within the park. Scuba diving is popular because of the many different kinds of life living in the water. Ecotourism in the ocean is the main way to get money to support the park

However, several fishermen died since the 1980s. People disagree about what happened to them. Park patrol and military said they needed to protect themselves. Fishermen living in the area say the park management killed the fishermen on purpose..

There are many different stories about the history of Hoto. In the old days, in Yamanashi, rice fields were replaced by mulberry fields, to grow silkworms. Then, cultivation of wheat become popular and dishes which use flour developed. In all of the dishes, Hoto was economical because it used many vegetables and stock. Also, its taste was good. Therefore, Hoto spread throughout Yamanashi.

First, knead flour with a little water in a bowl. Then spread the dough with a stick. Fold the dough and cut widely. You do not need to let it sit, or add salt. Nowadays, you can buy Hoto noodles around Yamanashi prefecture. The soup tastes like soybean paste. Adding pumpkin paste into the soup is popular. The stock is made from dried small sardines. The main ingredient is vegetables. In summer, leeks, onions, potatoes and so on are used. In winter, pumpkins, taro, carrots, napa cabbage and so on are used. Sometimes pork or chicken are used.

Pion

Pions (commonly shortened to a π) are a type of meson, which are subatomic particles made of a combination of quarks and antiquarks. Since antiquarks are antimatter, they will annihilate the same type (known as a flavour) of quark if they come near it. However, this reaction is not instantaneous, and so Pions, like all mesons, can exist for a short amount of time. What makes pions different from other mesons is that they are made of one up quark and one down quark, either of which can be the antiparticle. Pions are significant in science because they are thought to be responsible for the strong force interactions that occur between nucleons (protons or neutrons).

There are three types of Pions: π, π, and π. The +, -, or 0 in above the π simply refers to the charge of the pion. π are made of one up quark and one down antiquark. π are made of one down quark and one up antiquark. Since antiparticles have the opposite charge, a π is positive because an up quark has a charge of +2/3, and a down antiquark (normal down quarks have a spin of -1/3) has a spin of +1/3. The reverse statement applies for π. π can be formed with one up quark and an up antiquark, or one down quark and one down antiquark.

Force-carriers are particles that are responsible for forces, such as electromagnetism. As photons are believed to be responsible for electromagnetic force, mesons are believed to be responsible for some of the lower energy strong force interactions that occur between nucleons. (Strong force is also known as nuclear force). At an even smaller level, gluons are believed to be responsible for the strong force interactions between quarks. However, because they are made of the lightest quarks (up and down), pions are the lightest mesons. This means that they are also some of the longest-living mesons. However, like all mesons, they will eventually decay, or break down.

Pion decay will always produce leptons, like electrons. π will usually decay into one muon, and one muon neutrino. π will usually decay into one antimuon and one muon antineutrino. Neutral pions–π–will usually decay into two highly-energized photons. 

However, there is some probability (from <.1% to 1.2%) involved with the decay of some pions, as they can also decay into different forms. For π, the second most likely decay product is one positron (an anti-electron) and one electron neutrino. π will sometimes decay into one electron and one electron antineutrino. π will sometimes decay into one highly-energized photon, one electron, and one positron. (Keep in mind that positrons and electrons can annihilate each other, and this annihilation produces a highly-energized photon).

Since the decay of pions is due to weak force, yet another force carrier is introduced. During the decay, a W boson is created, which lasts for 3x10 seconds. After this incredibly short amount of time, the W boson will decay into the leptons that the pion would naturally decay to. However, it is important to draw this distinction, as it includes weak force.

Labyrinthodont

Labyrinthodont is a term which was used for fossil amphibia. Although it is no longer a formal term in taxonomy, it is still useful as a catch-all term. 

The Labyrinthodontia is not a clade, because it is not monophyletic. It has been replaced in the classification by more correct terms.

The labyrithodonts were some of the dominant animals from the Devonian to the Lower Triassic (about 390 to 210 million years ago). The group is an evolutionary grade (a paraphyletic group) of species which look rather similar. 

The name describes the pattern of infolding of the dentine and enamel of the teeth, which often fossilise. They are also have a heavily armoured skull roof (hence the even older name "Stegocephalia"), and complex vertebrae.

The labyrinthodonts flourished for more than 200 million years. There are a few anatomical traits that make their fossils distinct and easy to recognise:







Early tetropods are now classified as lobe-finned fish (Sarcopterygii). This is because we now know they were aquatic when the limbs first evolved (see Tetrapod). 

The informal term "fishapods" is often used for this group of Devonian animals. 

A more formal term, used by Clack, is "stem-group tetrapods".

Tau lepton

Tau (τ) leptons (aka tauons, tau particle) are one of the very small elementary particles. This means that they are believed to be so small that they can not be divided any more. Tau leptons can be thought of as very heavy electrons, as they are both leptons. This is because they have about 3,500 times as much mass as electrons, and about 17 times as much mass as muons. Since they only live for 2.9x10 seconds, they do not have a significant role in the regular world. However, they are very important in the decay of subatomic matter.

Like the other two basic leptons, tauons have a neutrino named after them (the tau neutrino).

Tau have a charge of -1, and can be written as τ. Since antimatter has the opposite of charge of regular matter, anti-tauons have a charge of +1, and can be written as τ. Tauons themselves are unstable, and can decay. Also, τ and τ can annihilate each other in a form of decay. When a single tauon decays, it is the only lepton that can decay into hadrons (things made of quarks). τ and τ can be formed by an electron-positron (antielectron) pair combining. The two tauons then decay into an electron or a positron, a muon or an antimuon, and four of the various neutrinos. However, a single tauon decays differently than a tauon and an antitauon.

A τ will quickly decay into a tau neutrino and a W boson. The W boson will exist for 3x10 seconds, before it decays into an electron or an electron antineutrino, a muon or a muon antineutrino, and a down quark or an up antiquark.

Kaon

Kaons are a specific type of meson (mesons are particles made of one quark and one antiquark). What makes kaons unique is that they are made of one up quark or down quark, and one strange quark. (One of the two quarks that make of a kaon must be an antiquark, and the other must be normal matter. For example, a kaon can be made of one up quark and an strange antiquark). The discovery of kaons was significant because it proved the existence of yet another flavour (type) of quark, the strange quark.

There are four types of kaons, but two of them are relatively easy to understand. There is the K and the K. The + and 0 above the letter K refer to whether the charge is positive, or 0 (neutral). The K is made of one up quark, and one strange antiquark. Since antiparticles have the opposite charge of their counterpart (and since normal strange quarks have a charge of -1/3), 2/3 + 1/3 = a +1 charge, or simply a + charge. (Also because antiparticles have the opposite charge of their counterpart, if you change the up quark in a K to an up antiquark and the strange antiquark to a normal strange quark, you get the opposite charge, forming a K). Since down quarks and strange quarks have the same charge, if either one of them is an antiparticle, the overall charge is zero. Therefore, a K can either be made of one down quark and strange antiquark, or one down antiquark and one normal strange quark.

<doc id="275284" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275284" title="Fredric Wertham">
Fredric Wertham

Fredric Wertham (20 March 1895 18 November 1981) was a Jewish German-American psychiatrist. He was an author who wrote about images in media. He thought that violent imagery in mass media and comic books was harmful to children. His best-known book was "Seduction of the Innocent" (1954). After this book became popular, the United States Congress took a close look at the comic book industry. Also, the Comics Code was made in response. He called television "a school for violence". 

He was born on 20 March 20 1895 in Munich. He studied medicine in Germany and England. He and Sigmund Freud wrote letters to each other, and Wertham chose to study mainly psychiatry. In 1922 he was asked to come to the United States and to join the Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. He became a United States citizen in 1927. He moved to New York City in 1932. He became the director of a psychiatric clinic connected with the New York Court of General Sessions. All people who were convicted of serious crimes had a psychiatric examination there. The report from those examinations were used in court. In 1935 Wertham spoke in court for the defense in the trial of Albert Fish, a serial killer. Wertham said Fish was insane.

In "Seduction of the Innocent", Wertham wrote about clear or hidden violence, sex, drug use, and other adult topics in "crime comics". Wertham used the words "crime comics" to mean popular comics about criminals and murder that were popular at that time. But, he also included superhero and horror comics in the same group of comics. He said that reading violent comics made children violent. However, this idea was from stories he had heard, not careful research.

Comics, especially the crime and horror titles started by EC Comics had many shocking or ugly images. Wertham often reproduced such images. He pointed out themes about death such as "injury to the eye" that he thought were common. One example Jack Cole's "Murder, Morphine and Me" in Magazine Village's "True Crime Comics" Vol. 1, #2 (May 1947). The story showed a character named Mary Kennedy who was a drug dealer. In her dream, she was almost stabbed in the eye with a needle by a drug addict.). Many of his other ideas seemed like nonsense to the comics industry. Wertham thought he saw hidden sexual themes in comics such as nude women hidden in drawings of muscles and tree bark. He also thought Batman and Robin were gay partners. Wertham's idea that Wonder Woman had a hidden story of bondage did have some facts to support it. Her creator William Moulton Marston had said the same thing. However, Wertham also claimed that Wonder Woman's strength and independence made her a lesbian.

Wertham's views on mass media have largely overshadowed his broader concerns with violence and with protecting children from psychological harm. His writings about the effects of racial segregation were evidence in the important Supreme Court case "Brown v. Board of Education". Part of his 1966 book, "A Sign for Cain", was about medical professionals and their actions in the Holocaust. He talked about the book on a popular TV program. Parts of these programs were shown at the 2003 Comic-Con International: San Diego

Beaty writes that in 1959 Wertham tried to sell a another book to follow "Seduction of the Innocent". It was called "The War on Children". The book was about the effect of television on children. Wertham was unhappy that no companies wanted to publish it.

Wertham always said he did not want censorship of comics. In the 1970s he was more interested in the good side of comics fan groups. In his last book, "The World of Fanzines" (1974), he concluded that fanzines were a good way to be creative. Wertham was asked to speak to the New York Comic Art Convention. Most comics fans still had bad opinions about him. They did not trust him and yelled at him during his speech. He soon stopped writing about comics. 

Before he retired, Wertham had several jobs. He became a professor of psychiatry at New York University. He was a senior psychiatrist in the New York City Department of Hospitals and a psychiatrist and the director of the Mental Hygiene Clinic at the Bellevue Hospital Center.

He died on November 18, 1981 at his retirement home in Kempton, Pennsylvania. He was 86 years old.

The Library of Congress keeps his papers. People were able to study them starting May 20, 2010. The library has a list of all of his writing. This list shows Wertham's many different interests.

<doc id="275299" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275299" title="Edward Drinker Cope">
Edward Drinker Cope

Edward Drinker Cope (Philadelphia, July 28, 1840 – Philadelphia, April 12, 1897) was an American biologist who was notable for his work on fossil animals of North America.

He was a paleontologist, comparative anatomist, herpetologist and ichthyologist who wrote many papers. His parents were wealthy Quakers. 

His father wanted him to be a farmer, but he became a scientist. He married his cousin. Later, they owned a museum in Philadelphia.

Mostly, he read books on his own to learn science and found things out himself. He was not a teacher. He did field work, and wrote a lot. In the 1870s and 1880s, he used to go the American West to report what the land was like to the government, often on a team sent by the United States Geological Survey. The USGS shows where natural resources are such as coal, wood, and water. 

For a while he and Othniel Charles Marsh were competing to find dinosaurs. This feud between them is called the Bone Wars. Sometimes being a scientist cost him more money than he could afford. In the 1880s, Cope lost so much money in the mining business he had to sell a lot of his fossil collection. In the 1890s he was no longer poor, but he died when he was only 57. 

1,400 of his articles were published in science journals. He discovered over 1,000 species of extinct animals. He wrote about hundreds of kinds of ancient fish. He discovered dozens of dinosaurs. He wrote about the evolution of mammalian molars teeth, and produced two huge works on the amphibia and reptiles of North America. 

Cope showed that horses evolved to be larger as they moved from woodland onto grassland. That the fossils show the mammals getting bigger over time is called Cope's rule.

Cope was the first son of Alfred and Hanna Cope. His father was a serious Quaker and ran the shipping business started by his father, Thomas P. Cope. The business was started in 1821. His parents took him to gardens, museums, and zoos. They taught him to read and write and draw. 

He started going to school when he was 9 years old. When he was 12, his parents sent him away to a Quaker boarding school. At 15 years old he studied biology (natural history) and often visited the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. They had a Natural history museum. 

His letters home show he felt farm work was not for him. Cope’s father made him get a summer job on a farm when he was 14 and 15. When he was 16 he was not sent to the boarding school any more because his father wanted him to be a farmer. His father wanted him to get more exercise, so he bought him a farm. Cope rented out the land to farmers and worked on farms. 

When he was 18 years old he, began working at the Academy of Natural Sciences part-time. He took classes. His father paid for them. Still, his father said he should farm. Until he was 23, his letters to his father kept saying he did not want to be a farmer and that he wanted to be a scientist. 

He worked at the Academy of Natural Sciences for two years, and became a member. He sometimes had to visit the Smithsonian Institution where he met Spencer Baird, who knew all about fish and birds. He also joined the American Philosophical Society. The Academy and the Society published journals, and they accepted his articles. 

In 1861 when he was 21 years old, he wrote about classifying salamanders. A salamander is an amphibian. He then took a comparative anatomy class from a famous teacher at the University of Pennsylvania. Cope then asked his father if he could learn German and French so he could read science books and novels in German and French.

At the beginning of the American Civil War Cope tried to get a job helping in a field hospital. Then, when he was 22, he wanted to somehow help out the freed blacks. That year, 1863, he and his fiancée broke up and he was sad. He went to Ireland, England and Europe. During his trip, he met famous scientists. 

While in Germany, he first met his rival, scientist Othniel Charles Marsh. On February 11, 1864, he wrote to his father, “I shall get home in time to . . . be caught by the new draft. I shall not be sorry for this . . . certain persons . . . would be mean enough to say that I have gone to Europe to avoid the war".

Cope’s return home to Philadelphia was before the end of the Civil War. He married a Quaker girl he knew, Annie Pim. She lived on a farm and the wedding was held at her house. 

Cope wrote papers on fish, whales, and one on a fossil frog with a tail. Cope’s father gave money to a small Quaker college called Haverford College. The college gave Cope an honorary master's degree and hired him to teach Zoology. 

Cope went on scientific trips to the American west and wrote letters to his parents and to his wife and daughter while on those trips. He told his father that teaching took up too much of his time for him to make scientific discoveries. He quit his job at the college. He and his wife and daughter then moved to Haddonfield to be closer to the fossil beds in western New Jersey. 

In Haddonfield, New Jersey were marlpits, where a dinosaur skeleton was discovered in 1858 by William Foulke and named "Hadrosaurus foulkii" by Dr. Leidy of Philadelphia's Academy of Natural Sciences. Cope found more fossils in the marlpits there. For example, he described "Elasmosaurus platyurus" and "Laelaps" in 1868. Edward Cope also went on expeditions to caves; the last cave he visited was the Wyandotte Caves in Indiana in 1871. 

In his 30s the Quaker wrote a lot of scientific papers that were published. Charles Sternberg said that in the fossil fields of Kansas Cope had a "severe attack of nightmare . . . every animal of which we had found trace during the day played with him at night . . . sometimes he would lose half the night in this exhausting slumber". 

Cope also looked for fossils in the west of the United States. In 1872 he explored Eocene rocks. The rocks were 55 to 38 million years old. That year, he worked too much and had a breakdown. In 1873 he studied the "Titanothere" beds (strata) of northeastern Colorado. "Titanothere" was a large extinct herbivore. 

In 1874 Cope volunteered for the Wheeler Survey. These geological mapping trips were led by George Montague Wheeler. They mapped parts of the United States west of the 100th meridian. The 100th meridian west is the boundary between the dry West and the rainy East of the United States. 

In 1874 Cope discovered the Puerco formation in New Mexico during the Wheeler Survey. The Puerco formation was a layer of soft rock 500 feet thick along the upper Puerco River near Cuba, New Mexico. It was green and black marl (that contained chemicals used in making fertilizer). Fossils were later found by someone at a similar formation west of there in a different county. Cope said it was like those fossils came from his Puerco formation, which he discovered. His cliff may have been dug by the river over a long time and it looked like it had been there a long time. It was something the scientists he knew had not seen before him. As part of the Wheeler Survey, he was able to shop at commissaries. He was able to get his finding in the reports the survey published. He brought his wife and daughter along on one trip of the survey, renting a house for them. As a volunteer, he paid his own way.

When Cope was 35, his father died, leaving him a quarter of a million dollars. The next year, 1876, Cope moved his wife and daughter from their house by the apple orchard in Haddonfield, New Jersey back to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – this time to a row house in the City. He bought two units and used the one next door as a paleo-lab for his fossil collection. He stopped doing field work to catch up on his writing. He hired teams to look for fossils for him. And, he helped the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition set up their fossil displays. In 1877 he was able to buy half of the "American Naturalist."

He published papers so fast his rival, Professor Marsh, had doubts about when Cope’s fossils were found. In August 1878 when he was 38, Cope sailed to the British Isles to attend a scientific convention in Dublin Ireland. He then sailed to France to go to a two-day scientific convention there. At one of the conventions he decided to buy some boxes of Argentine fossils, maybe for the museum in Philadelphia. 

When Cope came back, two years-worth of collecting by his man Lucas awaited him. This included a "Camarasaurus", a sauropod.

Cope introduced his (then) friend Marsh to the marl pit owner, Albert Vorhees, when the two visited the site. Later he discovered that Marsh had gone --behind Cope's back and made a private agreement with Vorhees: any fossils that Vorhees's men found were sent back to Marsh at New Haven.

In 1868 Professor Marsh said Cope put the skull of dinosaur at the tail end. It was "Elasmosaurus", a long-necked plesiosaur. It turned out Marsh was right, and Cope was humiliated.

The feud lasted for the rest of Cope’s life. Both became less wealthy trying to keep the other’s men from digging for fossils. Each criticized the other’s work in the New York Herald. Another time Marsh tried to keep Cope from getting his articles and books published, so Cope hired two fossil-finders away from Marsh. 
In 1889, U.S. Geological Survey stopped giving grants to Cope. Marsh persuaded John Wesley Powell to ask Cope to give the Survey the specimens Cope found back in 1874. Cope did not want to give the fossils to the Survey because when he found them he was a volunteer paying his own way. So, he spoke to the "New York Herald". The first article was on January 12, 1890. Cope said Marsh underpaid his workers and said some of what Marsh wrote was really written by others. Also, he said Powell was spending tax money wrong and had made mistakes in classifying fossils. Later, another article gave their side of the story. As a result of the articles, the Survey lost its funding for fossil-finding. Marsh got fired from the Survey. And, Cope almost got fired from the University of Pennsylvania. Cope wondered if people thought of him as “a liar . . . actuated by jealousy and disappointment.” He seemed sorry Marsh had been fired, writing to Paleontologist Henry Osborn, “I think Marsh is impaled on the horns of "Monoclonius sphenocerus".

In 1882 Cope wrote a paper about a fossil pelycosaur "Edaphosaurus". It looked like a lizard with a huge fin along its back. In 1886 Professor Cope fired his fossil diggers and started selling some of his large fossil collection to museums. He also wrote forty more scientific reports about their findings that year. 

In 1889 he reported "Coelophysis", a slender dinosaur from the Upper Triassic. This little carnivore is one of the earliest dinosaurs found. The same year, he succeeded Joseph Leidy, who had died the previous year, as professor of zoology at the University of Pennsylvania.

In 1892, Cope (then 52 years old) was granted expense money for field work from the Texas Geological Survey. With his finances improved, he was able to publish a massive work on the "Batrachians of North America", which was the most detailed work on the continent's frogs and amphibians ever done, and the 1,115-page "The Crocodilians, Lizards and Snakes of North America". 

In the 1890s his publication rate increased to an average of 43 articles a year. His final expedition to the West took place in 1894, when he prospected for dinosaurs in South Dakota and visited sights in Texas and Oklahoma.

In 1895 Cope re-hired Sternberg, who knew about the nightmares he had about dinosaurs, to look for fossils for him.

Cope sold fossils to museums. For example, in 1895 the American Museum of Natural History in New York City bought his collection of about 10,000  fossil mammals.

Cope sold three other collections for $29,000. Although his collection still contained more than 13,000 specimens, Cope's fossil hoard was much smaller than Marsh's collection, which was valued at over a million dollars.

In 1896 Cope got sick, and he died on April 12, 1897. His friends told of how they remembered him. They then held the reading of his will. The "American Journal of Science" had an obituary about Cope. The "Naturalist" had a longer one. And, the National Academy of Sciences' journal had one years later.

Edward D. Cope was a Quaker. His biographer Henry Osborn wrote, “If Edward... (had) doubts about the... Bible... he did not (tell) them in his letters to his family, but there can be little question... that he shared the intellectual unrest of the period". Cope was conservative about women working or voting. He felt the husband should be able to take care of his wife and that married women would vote the same as their husbands. 

He was remembered as not liking the Negro accent, and he believed that if "a race was not white then it was inherently more ape-like". 

Although his daughter Julia burnt many of his private papers, many of his friends have written about him. Charles R. Knight, a former friend, said that Cope's language was so filthy that "in [Cope's] heyday no woman was safe within five miles of him". 

People said Cope had great energy and activity and was always interesting, kind and helpful. Others said he had a temper and said he was a "militant paleontologist". Some say he was well-liked by those who lived when he did. 

Cope said Charles Darwin's book "The Voyage of the Beagle" had "too much geology in it". 

Over his lifetime Cope's views on evolution shifted. His original view, described in the paper "On the Origin of Genera" (1868), held that while Darwin's natural selection may affect the preservation of superficial characteristics in organisms, natural selection alone could not explain the formation of genera.

Cope's beliefs became one with an increased emphasis on continual and utilitarian evolution with less involvement of a Creator. He became one of the founders of the Neo-Lamarckism school of thought, which holds that individuals can pass on traits acquired in its lifetime to offspring. Although the view has been shown to be incorrect, it was common among paleontologists in Cope's time. In 1887, Cope published his own "Origin of the Fittest: essays in evolution", detailing his views on the subject. He was a strong believer in the law of use and disuse—that an individual will slowly, over time, favor an anatomical part of its body so much that it will become stronger and larger as time progresses down the generations. This theory fails because use and disuse does not affect the genetic code of the gametes, something which became clear in the generations after his death.

The National Science Foundation (NSF) is a United States government agency that supports fundamental research and education in all the non-medical fields of science and engineering. Its medical counterpart is the National Institutes of Health. With an annual budget of about US$6.87 billion (fiscal year 2010), the NSF funds approximately 20 percent of all federally supported basic research conducted by the United States' colleges and universities. In some fields, such as mathematics, computer science, economics and the social sciences, the NSF is the major source of federal backing.

The NSF's director, deputy director, and the 24 members of the National Science Board (NSB) are appointed by the President of the United States, and confirmed by the United States Senate. The director and deputy director are responsible for administration, planning, budgeting and day-to-day operations of the foundation, while the NSB meets six times a year to establish its overall policies.

Drosophila pseudoobscura

Drosophila pseudoobscura is a species of fruit fly, used extensively in lab studies of the genetics of natural populations.

It was first used by Theodosius Dobzhansky and his colleagues. They collected samples from populations in western North America and Mexico, and grew them in 'population cages' in the laboratory. They were interested in natural selection, genetic drift, and other aspects of population genetics.

In 1989 Diane Dodd gave laboratory populations of "D. pseudoobscura" two different food types, starch and maltose. They rapidly evolved into two distinct groups after only eight generations with the different foods. As the two groups both showed a strong preference for mating with their own type, this was claimed as an example of allopatric (geographical) speciation by reproductive isolation. Dodd's experiment has been repeated by others, and works with other kinds of fruit flies and foods.

In 2005, "D. pseudoobscura" was the second "Drosophila" species to have its genome sequenced, after "Drosophila melanogaster".

Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans

Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans (13 September 1676 – 23 December 1744) was a niece of Louis XIV and wife of Leopold, Duke of Lorraine. She was later regent of Lorraine. As a widow she was created Princess of Commercy. Among her children was Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor, father of Marie Antoinette. 

Élisabeth Charlotte was born at the Château de Saint-Cloud the daughter of Philippe, Duke of Orléans and of his second wife, Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate. Her father was the only sibling of King Louis XIV of France.

She was entitled to have the style of "Her Royal Highness". At birth, she was given the honorary style "Mademoiselle de Chartres". After the marriage of her two older half-sisters, Marie Louise and Anne Marie born of the first marriage of their father to Henrietta of England, she was known as "Madame Royale", according to her status as the highest-ranking unmarried princess in France.

There were plans for her to marry Joseph Clemens of Bavaria (Élisabeth Charlotte herself refused), William III of England, Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I, Joseph was suggested by Pope Innocent XII himself, as well as her widowed first cousin Louis, Grand Dauphin. Another was Louis Auguste de Bourbon, Duke of Maine, eldest son of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan.

Élisabeth Charlotte was finally married on 13 October 1698 at the Palace of Fontainebleau to Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, son of Charles V, Duke of Lorraine, and of the Archduchess Eleonora of Austria. The marriage was the result of the Treaty of Ryswick, one of its conditions being that the Duchy of Lorraine, which had been for many years in the possession of France, be restored to Leopold, a son of Charles V, Duke of Lorraine. Thus, Élisabeth Charlotte was but an instrument to cement the peace treaty. The House of Lorraine received a dowry of 900,000 Livres. 

To everyone surprise, what had been expected to be an unhappy union turned out to be a marriage of love and happiness. With the birth of her children, Élisabeth Charlotte showed great maternal instinct and a naturally caring character. The marriage produced thirteen children, of which five survived into adulthood. Three of them died within a week in May 1711 due to a smallpox outbreak at the Château de Lunéville, the country seat of the Duke's of Lorraine.

Her husband died in 1729, leaving his wife Regent of Lorraine for their son, Francis Stephen of Lorraine. After being educated in Vienna, Francis Stephen returned to Lorraine in 1737, ending his mother's tenure as regent.

Élisabeth Charlotte tried to engage her youngest child Anne Charlotte to King Louis XV; this project failed due to the intrigues of Duke of Bourbon; Élisabeth Charlotte then tried to arrange the marriage of Anne Charlotte to her first cousin Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans, who had been recently widowed; Louis d'Orléans refused. 

Unable to prevent her son from giving up the duchy of Lorraine to Stanisław Leszczyński when he married the Habsburg heiress, Maria Theresa of Austria, Élisabeth Charlotte moved into the "Château d’Haroué" in nearby Commercy, which was turned into a sovereign principality for her to enjoy during her dowager years. 

Élisabeth Charlotte died of a stroke, on 23 December 1744, one week after her daughter-in-law and grandchild, at the age of sixty-eight. She was the last of her siblings to die and had outlived ten of her thirteen children. Nine months after her death, her son Francis Stephen became Holy Roman Emperor.

She was buried in the funerary chapel of the Dukes of Lorraine in the "Saint-François-des-Cordeliers" church in Nancy.

Born at the Royal Palace of Turin, he was a son of Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia and his second wife Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg. He was styled as the "Duke of Savoy" from birth. As a young prince, he surrounded himself with intellectuals and stayed far from public life.

He married Maria Antonia of Spain (1729–1785), youngest daughter of Philip V of Spain and Elisabeth Farnese, on 31 May 1750 at Oulx and later had twelve children. He had a loving relationship with his wife who exerted little influence over her husband]. The marriage had been arranged by Maria Antonia's half brother, the ruling Ferdinand VI of Spain. 

When Victor Amadeus came to the throne in 1773 he started working on bureaucratic and military aspects of the reign. He was suspicious of anything innovative.

At the outbreak of the French Revolution, Victor Amadeus III allowed his two son's in law, the Counts of Artois, Provence and the Princesses Marie Adélaïde and Victoire to stay in his kingdom under his protection.

He died at the Castle of Moncalieri having suffered an attack of apoplexy. He died leaving an economically damaged kingdom and two key provinces – Savoy and Nice – devastated having suffered at the hands of French revolutionary forces. He was buried at the Basilica of Superga in Turin.

<doc id="275405" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275405" title="Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon">
Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon

Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon, (13 March 1753 – 23 June 1821), was the daughter of Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthièvre and of Maria Teresa d'Este. At the death of her brother, Louis Alexandre de Bourbon, "prince de Lamballe", she became the wealthiest heiress in France. She married the future "Philippe Égalité", and was the mother of France's last king, Louis Philippe I, King of the French. 

Marie-Adélaïde was born on 13 March 1753 at the Hôtel de Toulouse in Paris. Styled "Mademoiselle d'Ivoy" initially and, as a young girl, until her marriage, "Mademoiselle de Penthièvre" (derived from the duchy inherited by her father). The style of "Mademoiselle de Penthièvre" had been previoulsy borne by her sister Marie Louise de Bourbon (1751–1753) who died six months after Marie Adélaïde's birth. She was raised in a convent, the "Abbaye de Montmartre", overlooking Paris. 

At the death, on 8 May 1768, of her brother and only sibling, the Prince of Lamballe, Marie Adélaïde became heiress to what was to become the largest fortune of France. Her marriage to Louis "Philippe" Joseph d'Orléans, Duke of Chartres, son of the Duke of Orléans, had been envisaged earlier and, while the Duke of Penthièvre saw in it the opportunity for his daughter to marry into the family of the "First Prince of the Blood", the Orléans did not want a union with an illegitimate branch of the royal family. However, the Orléans' mind changed when the Prince of Lamballe's death left his sister sole heiress to the family fortune. Although Marie Adélaîde was much in love with her Orléans cousin, Louis XV warned Penthièvre against such a marriage because of the reputation of the young Duke of Chartres as a womaniser.

Her marriage to the Duke of Chartres took place at the Palace of Versailles on 5 April 1769. 

During the first few months of their marriage, the couple appeared devoted to each other, but the duke went back to the life of "libertinage" he had led before his marriage. It is during the summer of 1772, a few months after his wife had given birth to a stillborn daughter, that began Philippe's secret liaison with one of her ladies-in-waiting, Madame de Genlis, the niece of Madame de Montesson, the morganatic wife of Philippe's father. Passionate at first, the liaison cooled within a few months and, by the spring of 1773, was reported to be "dead". After the romantic affair was over, Félicité remained in the service of Marie Adélaïde at the Palais-Royal, a trusted friend to both Marie Adélaïde and Philippe. They both appreciated her intelligence and, in July 1779, she became the governess of the couple's twin daughters born in 1777. 

On 5 April 1791, Marie Adélaïde left her unfaithful husband and went to live with her father at the "château de Bizy" in Normandy. In September 1792, having sided with the Revolution, the Duke of Orléans was elected to the National Convention under the name of "Philippe Égalité". Siding with the radical group called The Mountain ("La Montagne"), he was from the very beginning suspect in the eyes of the Girondists ("Girondins"), who wanted all the Bourbons to be banished from France. The fate of the Orléans family was sealed when Marie-Adélaïde's eldest son, the duc de Chartres, "Général Égalité" in the Army of the North commanded by Charles François Dumouriez, sought political asylum from the Austrians in March 1793. On 6 April, all the members of the Orléans family still remaining in France were arrested.

After their arrest in Paris, Philippe Égalité and his son, the comte de Beaujolais, were imprisoned in the Abbey prison ("prison de l'Abbaye") in Paris. Later, the two were transferred to the prison of Fort Saint-Jean in Marseille, where they were soon joined by the duc de Montpensier who had been arrested while serving as an officer in the Army of the Alps. The day before his father and brothers were arrested in France, the duc de Chartres rushed to Tournai, near the French border, where his sister Adélaïde and Mme de Genlis had been living since Philippe Égalité had made them emigrate in November 1792.

Upon the execution of her husband, Marie-Adélaïde, now known as ""Veuve Égalité"" (Widow "Égalité"), was incarcerated at the Luxembourg Palace, which had been transformed into a prison during the Revolution. There she met the man who was to become the "love of her life", a former member of the National Convention named Jacques-Marie Rouzet. The two always remained together and lived in Paris until 1797, when a decree banished the remaining members of the House of Bourbon from France.

Marie Adélaïde was exiled to Spain, as was her sister-in-law Bathilde d'Orléans. Rouzet accompanied them to the Spanish border and managed to secretly join them in Barcelona where he became her chancellor. 

Marie Adélaïde, Rouzet and the Orléans exiled in Spain returned to France in 1814 at the time of the first Bourbon Restoration. After legal battles which lasted until her death, the bulk of her inheritance was eventually recovered. She died in her castle at Ivry-sur-Seine having suffered from breast cancer. She also was buried at the "Chapelle royale de Dreux".

Thallium(I) sulfate, also known as thallous sulfate, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is TlSO. It has thallium and sulfate ions in it. The thallium is in its +1 oxidation state.

Thallium(I) sulfate is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. It is very toxic, though. It dissolves easily in water and is similar to potassium sulfate. 

It is made by dissolving thallium ore or thallium metal in sulfuric acid.

It was used in rat poison, but since it is so similar to other chemicals, it poisoned some people and was outlawed. It was also used for some medicines before it was found that it was too toxic. It stops plants from germinating. It is the main source of thallium in the laboratory and is used to make thallium(I) sulfide. 

Thallium sulfate, like all thallium compounds, is very toxic. This is because the size of the thallium ion is very similar to the size of the potassium ion. After it goes into the cells, it cannot be used like potassium is used and so kills the cell. It also gets absorbed through the skin. Eating more than 1/2 gram can kill. It gets deposited in the kidney, liver, brain, and similar places. It has been blamed for the extinction of the Brown Fish Owl.

Up quark

Up quarks are subatomic particles that help make up many larger particles, like protons. Up quarks have a charge of +2/3, and are the lightest of the six types (flavours) of quarks. Like all fermions (non force-carrying particles), Up quarks have a spin of 1/2. They are affected by all four of the fundamental forces, which are gravity, strong force, weak force, and electromagnetism. Like all quarks, Up quarks are elementary particles, which means that they are so small that scientists believe that they can not be divided any more.

Protons (which have a total charge of +1) are made of two up quarks (which have a charge of +2/3) and one down quark (which have a charge of -1/3). Neutrons (which have a total charge of 0) are made of one up quark, and two down quarks. Up quarks can also be used to create more complex particles, such as pions.

The Rape of the Lock

The Rape of the Lock is a poem written by Alexander Pope, mocking heros and heroines. It was first published anonymously in "Lintot's Miscellany" in May 1712.

The poem is sarcastically laughing at the epic world of the gods. It was based on an incident that was remembered by Pope's friend, John Caryll. Arabella Fermor and Robert Petre were both from Catholic families at a time in England when Anglicanism was very important. Petre, lusting after Arabella, had cut a lock of her hair to keep without permission, which made the two families have a big argument. This was because in those days, cutting off a lock of the lover's hair was scandalous and symbolized improper love. Pope, also a Catholic, wrote the poem to make the two families reconcile and be happy again. He made the character Belinda to represent Arabella in the poem.

Pope's poem mocks all the traditions of classics. Although the poem is funny at times, Pope keeps a sense that beauty is fragile, and that just because Belinda loses a lock of her hair she is very deeply hurt.

Three of Uranus's moons are named after characters from "The Rape of the Lock": Belinda, Umbriel, and Ariel.

Gorgonopsid

The Gorgonopsids were Therapsids.

There were a successful group which lived during the Permian period, about 260 million years ago. They became extinct in the Permian–Triassic extinction event. 

They were the major predators of their day. They had large, powerful, square-shaped jaws with huge, sabre-like canine and interlaced, socket-like teeth. Many fossils have been found in South Africa.

The largest known, "Inostrancevia", was the size of a large bear with a 45 cm long skull, and 12-cm long saber-like teeth. 

The Gorgonopsidae are divided into three sub-families:

Down quarks (sometimes written as a "d") are very small particles that help make up many larger particles, like protons and neutrons. Down quarks have a charge of -1/3. Since Down quarks are fermions (which means that no two of them can exist in the same space at the same time), they have a spin of 1/2. Down quarks are the second lightest quark, the first being up quarks.

The antiparticle of a Down quark is a Down antiquark, or simply an antidown.

Strange quark

Strange quarks are the third lightest quarks, which are subatomic particles that are so small, they are believed to not be able to be divided. Like down quarks, strange quarks have a charge of -1/3. Like all fermions (which are particles that can not exist in the same place at the same time), strange quarks have a spin of 1/2. What makes strange quarks different from down quarks–apart from having 25 times the mass of down quarks–is that they have something that scientists call "strangeness." Strangeness is basically a resistance to decay against strong force and electromagnetism. This means that any particle that contains a strange quark can not decay due to strong force (or electromagnetism), but instead with the much slower weak force. 

Strange quarks can be found in particles such as kaons and some hyperons. Scientists began noticing strangeness when these particles did not decay as quickly as their masses would have suggested they would have. However, it took them a long time to even guess strangeness was the answer because it took over 16 years to predict it after the discovery of kaons.

Charm quarks or c quarks are the third most massive of the six quarks. Like all quarks, they are thought to be so small that they can not be divided. (They are called elementary particles for this reason). Similar to up quarks, charm quarks have a charge of +2/3. Although charm quarks are not extremely common, they can be found in particles created by particle accelerators (which smash atoms together at extremely high speeds), such as J/ψ mesons, D mesons, and other charmed particles. Since they are fermions (particles that can not have more than one of that particle at the same place at the same time), charm quarks have a spin of 1/2. 

The discovery of charm quarks – and J/ψ mesons – led to a rapid series of scientific breakthroughs. These events are known as the November revolution.

Othniel Charles Marsh

Othniel Charles Marsh M.A PhD LL.D (October 29, 1831 – March 18, 1899) was one of the leading paleontologists of the 19th century. He discovered and named many fossils found in western North America.

Marsh was born in Lockport, New York, into a family of modest means. However, he was the nephew of the very wealthy banker and philanthropist, George Peabody. 

He graduated from Yale College in 1860. He later studied geology and mineralogy in New Haven, and afterwards paleontology and anatomy in Berlin, Heidelberg and Breslau. He returned to the United States in 1866 and was appointed professor of vertebrate paleontology at Yale University. He persuaded his uncle George Peabody to establish the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale.

Marsh and his many fossil hunters were able to uncover about 500 new species of fossil animals, which were named by Marsh himself. 

In May 1871, Marsh uncovered the first pterosaur fossils found in America. He also found early horses, the Cretaceous and Jurassic dinosaurs "Apatosaurus" and "Allosaurus", and described the toothed birds of the Cretaceous; "Ichthyornis" and "Hesperornis". 

Marsh is also known for the so-called "Bone Wars" waged against Edward Drinker Cope. The two men were fiercely competitive, discovering and documenting more than 120 new species of dinosaur between them. Marsh eventually won the Bone Wars by finding 80 new species of dinosaur, while Cope only found 56.

Bottom quarks or beauty quarks are the second most massive of the elementary particles (particles that are so small that they can not be divided any more). All quarks are elementary particles. Bottom quarks have a charge of -1/3, similar to down quarks. Although bottom quarks are not very common, they are found in particles such as B mesons, among others. All bottom quarks will decay into charm quarks or up quarks in about 10, due to weak force.

Top quarks or truth quarks are the heaviest known elementary particles (particles that are so small that they can not be divided). All quarks are elementary particles, and since they are fermions (which means that no two of them can exist in the same place at the same time), they have a spin of 1/2. Top quarks interact with all four of the fundamental forces, which are gravity, electromagnetism, strong force, and weak force. Almost all of the time, top quarks will decay into a bottom quark and a W boson, although it can sometimes decay into a strange quark.

One top quark weighs about as much as one atom of tungsten. Since top quarks are so massive, scientists have been able to make predictions about the mass of the theoretical particle known as a Higgs Boson. Unfortunately, top quarks are only believed to be able to exist for 5x10 seconds.

Gauge bosons are carrier particles for three of the four fundamental forces. The three gauge bosons are as follows:


Mesons are not considered to be gauge bosons of the strong force, because only the lighter mesons are thought to be responsible for the interaction responsible for the strong force.

The only remaining fundamental force that has no known gauge boson is gravity. The theoretical gauge boson for gravity is called a graviton.

All gauge bosons are bosons, which simply means that two or more of them can exist in the same place at the same time, unlike fermions. It also means that gauge bosons have a spin of 0 or 1. 

Gauge bosons are the particles that are thought to interact with a Higgs field. This theoretical field is believed by many scientists to be responsible for why some gauge bosons – like W and Z bosons – have mass, while others – such as photons – do not have mass.

Hyperon

Hyperons are particles that are made of quarks. What makes them different from other baryons (particles made of three quarks) is that they must have have at least one strange quark, but no charm quarks or bottom quarks. Strange quarks have a property known as strangeness. Strangeness causes the strange quark–and all other particles bonded with it–to not decay by strong force, but instead due to the much slower weak force. Since all quarks are fermions (which means that no two of them can be in the same point in space at the same point in time), each quark has a spin of 1/2, adding up to a total spin of 3/2 for a hyperon. This quickly decays into a 1/2 spin particle. 

Hyperons themselves decay due to weak force. There are dozens of different hyperon combinations. For example, a Λ (lambda) hyperon has a charge of 0, and is often written as Λ. When it decays, it usually creates one proton, and one antipion. Like many forms of weak force decay, there is more than one possible outcome. A Λ also has a significantly lower, but still possible, chance to decay into a neutron and an uncharged pion. Λ hyperons have an average lifespan of 2.6x10 seconds, which makes it one of the longest living hyperons.

Scientists still study hyperons in labs across the world, such as CERN, Fermilab, and SLAC. Hyperons provide answers questions for problems such as CP Violation, in which symmetries that were believed to be true may not be true.

The Donner Party were a group of people who tried to cross the Sierra Nevada mountains in the winter of 1846–1847. Many of them died from cold weather. Because of this, they became famous in the history of the American West.

The group started in the Midwest in 1846, and tried to get to California. They made it to Fort Bridger in Wyoming without trouble, but after that they took a way to California that was not used much. This route was called the Hastings cut-off. Instead of being shorter, it took them much longer to get across Nevada. They stopped in Reno, Nevada for a few days in October 1846 to get supplies.

Once they left Reno, snow fell earlier than normal, and trapped them in the mountains. The group made shelters, but ran out of food. On 16 December seventeen people tried to go west again. Of these, two went back to the camp. Of the fifteen who kept going, seven stayed alive and reached a settlement on the western side of the mountains after 32 days. 

After this, a rescue party went back, and in about two weeks made it to one of the camps set up in the mountains. After this, three more groups tried to rescue those trapped in the mountains. The last person was rescued on 7 April 1847.

In all, 42 people from the original Donner Party died, and there were 47 who survived. Some of the survivors used cannibalism to survive. All the survivors made it to California, but they disagreed about what happened during the winter and whose fault it was.

Today, there are several memorials to the group, including a monument and the Donner Memorial State Park. A lake was also named for them.

Saddam Hussein made a temporary annexation of Kuwait as the 19th province of Iraq. It was not recognized by the United Nations or other countries. 

After the occupation, Iraq took over many of the Kuwaiti oil fields and started taking the oil to keep for Iraq. Factories, businesses and industries were also taken over by Iraqis as well.

After seven months of occupation, the United Nations launched a US led coalition to enter Kuwait to free it from Iraq.

Charles R. Knight

Charles Robert Knight (Brooklyn, October 21, 1874 – Manhattan, April 15, 1953) was an American artist famous for his paintings of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals.

His works were reproduced in many books, and are on display at several major museums in the United States.

As a child, Knight was deeply interested in nature and animals, and spent many hours copying the illustrations from his father’s natural history books. Though legally blind, he was partially sighted. He had severe astigmatism, and a later injury to his right eye, but had specially-designed glasses. At twelve, he enrolled at the Metropolitan Art School to become a commercial artist. 

In his free time, Knight visited the American Museum of Natural History, and attracted the attention of Dr. Jacob Wortman. Soon the museum commissioned Knight to produce a series of watercolors for their fossil halls.

These paintings were hugely popular among visitors, and Knight continued to work with the museum well into the 1930s. He painted what would become some of the most celebrated images of dinosaurs, prehistoric mammals, and prehistoric humans.

One of Knight's best-known pieces for the American Museum of Natural History is 1897’s "Leaping Laelaps", one of the few pre-1960s images to present dinosaurs as active, fast-moving creatures. This was long before the theories of modern paleontologists like Robert Bakker. 

Other familiar American Museum paintings include Knight’s portrayals of "Agathaumas", "Allosaurus", "Brontosaurus", "Smilodon", and the Woolly Mammoth. All of these have been reproduced many times.

Soon, natural history museums throughout the country began asking Knight for paintings as background for their own fossil exhibits. In 1925 Knight produced an elaborate mural for the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. This illustrated some of the birds and mammals whose remains had been found in the nearby La Brea Tar Pits. 

The following year, Knight began a 28-mural series for Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History, a project which showed the history of life on earth and took four years to complete. At the Field Museum, he produced one of his best-known pieces, a mural featuring "Tyrannosaurus" and "Triceratops". This confrontation scene between a predator and its prey would inspire many imitations, establishing the two dinosaurs as 'mortal enemies' in the popular consciousness..

Knight’s work also found its way to the Carnegie Museums in Pittsburgh; the Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C.; and Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History, among others. Several zoos, such as the Bronx Zoo, the Lincoln Park Zoo, and the Brookfield Zoo, also got Knight to paint murals of their living animals. 

Knight illustrated books and magazines, and became a frequent contributor to "National Geographic". He also wrote and illustrated several books of his own, such as "Before the Dawn of History" (Knight, 1935), "Life Through the Ages" (1946), "Animal Drawing: Anatomy and Action for Artists" (1947), and "Prehistoric Man: The Great Adventure" (1949). Additionally, Knight became a popular lecturer, describing prehistoric life to audiences across the country.

Knight worked in an era when new and often fragmentary fossils were coming out of the American west in quantity. Understandably, not all of his creations were based on solid evidence. His painting of ceratopsians as solitary animals in lush grassy landscapes was incorrect. The grasslands which feature in many of his paintings did not appear until the Cenozoic, and ceratopsians are known to have been gregarious animals. 

Knight restored many dinosaurs with typical reptilian-like limbs and narrow hips. In the 1920s, studies by palaeontologists had confirmed that dinosaurs had broad avian-like hips rather than those of a present-day reptile. 

Knight often restored extinct mammals, birds and marine reptiles in action poses, but his depictions of large dinosaurs as ponderous swamp-dwellers destined for extinction reflected more traditional concepts. In his catalogue to "Life through the Ages" (1946), he repeated views he had written earlier (Knight, 1935). He described the great beasts as "slow-moving dunces" that were "unadaptable and unprogressive" while conceding that small dinosaurs may have been more active. In fact, by their long survival in a world of many predators, herbivorous dinosaurs were as effective as they needed to be.

The single most obvious fault in his dinosaur paintings was one he shared with all the paleontologists of his day. They did not realise the tail was used as a counter-balance, and so in movement was held horizontal, not dragged along the ground. In many species the ligaments of the tail were ossified (turned into bone), so the tail simply must have been horizontal. "Deinonychus" is a good example.

This issue, which was certainly not Knight's fault, limits the usefulness today of many of his best illustrations.

Other admirers have included special effects artist Ray Harryhausen, who writes in his autobiography "An Animated Life", “Long before Obie (Willis O'Brien), myself, and Steven Spielberg, he put flesh on creatures that no human had ever seen. […] At the L.A. County Museum I vividly remember a beautiful Knight mural on one of the walls depicting the way the tar pits would have looked in ancient times. This, plus a picture book about Knight’s work my mother gave me, were my first encounters with a man who was to prove an enormous help when the time came for me to make three-dimensional models of these extinct beings”.

Though many other paleoartists have succeeded Knight (most notably Zdeněk Burian) Knight’s paintings still remain very popular among paleontology enthusiasts.

Pseudopodia (which translates to "false feet") are temporary cytoplasm-filled parts of the cell wall that can move out of the cell wall. They are used in some eukaryotic cells to move around or to eat. Most cells that do this are called amoeboids. The amoeba is a common example.

The cell wall makes a network of fibers. The cytoplasm flows into the network and fills it up, similar to a net filled with gelatin. This is able to move, lengthen, or shorten.

Pseudopedia are used by some cells to move around. They can detect food and place it inside the cell. The human white blood cell uses this way to get around.

Rhynchosaur

Rhynchosaurs were a group of Triassic diapsid reptiles related to the archosaurs. They were herbivores, and at times abundant (in some fossil localities accounting for 40 to 60% of specimens found), with stocky bodies and a powerful beak.

They became extinct at the End-Triassic extinction event.

Vitoria-Gasteiz

Vitoria-Gasteiz is the Basque Country capital. It is in the north of Spain and was a little town until 1950. Since 1950 the city has changed a lot because of important industrialization.

The official name of the city is Vitoria-Gasteiz. People usually call it simply Vitoria or Gasteiz. In Basque it is called Gasteiz, and some Basque speakers call it Vitorixe.

In 2010, Vitoria-Gasteiz had a population of more or less 240,000.
Between 1960 and 1970, the city grew a lot because people arrived to work at the new and great industrial companies. Statistics say the population doubled between these dates, and this is the motive for a great transformation, not only demographic but social.

Later, in 1980, Vitoria-Gasteiz was named the Basque Country capital, and the new public institutions, the Basque Government and Basque Parliament were located in Vitoria. This was an important impetus for the tertiary sector. This, together with the great industrial firms were responsible for a big social change in the city.

There has been another change in the population as people have come from other countries in recent years to work in building and industry. This happened later in Vitoria-Gasteiz and the Basque Country than in other areas. Today, non-EU (European Union) newcomers form 5.8% of the population in Vitoria-Gasteiz, 5% in Araba and 3.4% in the Basque Country. The main motive why Vitoria-Gasteiz has more of these immigrants is because recently there was a lot of jobs in building, a sector where Basque people will not work.

The inhabitants in Vitoria-Gasteiz live in apartments, and there are not many detached houses like in other towns in Europe. There are nice neighbourhoods, some with big squares, trees and parks where young people and families with children live, and other older neighbourhoods with beautiful and narrow streets and where older people walk.

Vitoria-Gasteiz became an industrial city in the second half of the twentieth century. There had been some companies already. For example, Bartolome Riego set up a printing press in the town for the first time in 1722.
Industries began on the outskirts of the city, away from the centre, special areas for making objects. Companies from Biscay (Bizkaia) and Gipuzkoa moved to Vitoria because land was cheaper there. Between 1950 and 1977, 833 companies started in the city.
The largest effects of this was that the city grew quickly, with many immigrants and a mixture of cultures. Between 1950 and 1975 the population grew from 53,000 to 173,000. In 1975, only 41.8% of the population had been born in the city.

Vitoria-Gasteiz is a very old city. It was founded in 1180 by the Navarrese King Sancho VI, who conquered the small hill village of Gasteiz and decided to call it New Victoria.
Only nineteen years later the city fell into the hands Castille´s King Alfonso VIII. The new king enlarged the city with three new streets on the west side of the hill. (Correría, Zapatería, Herrería)
In 1202 a terrible fire almost destroyed the town.
The city prospered quickly it was on the shortest way between the Court of Castille and northern Europe.

In 1443 another terrible fire affected the western part of the city.
After that, new houses had to be built of stone and adobe.
In 1492 the expulsion of Jews had an negative impact and caused a long period of decline.

In this century the customs house was moved from Vitoria to the coast, seriously affecting the local economy. However, the effect was softened with the development of the services sector.

With the turn of the century come the first modern factories. They were small family businesses. Now there are also multinationals, for example Mercedes Benz and Michelin.
Between 1950 and 1975 the city tripled its population and new districts were built.
In 1980 the Basque Parliament chose Vitoria-Gasteiz as the capital of the Basque Country.

The city is characterized as green and sustainable.
We could define the current Vitoria-Gasteiz as a city designed and planned to live in.

Vitoria-Gasteiz has several important buildings. Its medieval quarter is in the highest part of the city.
Its streets are narrow. There are several historic houses : Montehermoso, Villasuso, Escoriaza, Esquíbel, etc. There are also the Archaeology and Card Museums.
Other buildings are the Cordon House, and the Portalon, where there is a famous restaurant.

In Senda Avenue is Ajuria-Enea, the house of the President of the Basque Country.
Opposite it is the Ruiz de Austri Palace, now the Fine Art Gallery.
The Architect Olaguibel designed the Arquillos building, the most important in the City.

Vitoria - Gasteiz will be European Green Capital in 2012. The European Green Capital Conference in Stockholm gave the award to Vitoria on 21 October 2011; Other cities competed, for example Barcelona, Malmo, Nantes, Nuremberg and Reykjavik. In the end Vitoria, the second smallest city, was champion.

Vitoria has a green ring around the city, with more than 11000 hectares (27,000 acres) of trees and different species of animals. There are also a lot of tracks for walking and cycing.

Water usage is another reason why Gasteiz won the award, because it is one the cities of Europe than wastes less water - only 10%, and its inhabitants are reasonable consumers. Other towns lose 50%. 25% of domestic rubbish is recycled, but it is possible to improve.

It is true that a lot of inhabitants use public transport (trams and buses) and bike to move in the city but there are too many people who use cars.

The prize is very important for the city because its population has been working on improving its environment for the last 30 years. With the green capital prize the environment is the future for Vitoria and its inhabitants.

The Museo de Bellas Artes - the Fine Art Gallery - in Frai Francisco Walk (street) is of special interest. It is an early twentieth century renaissance style building opposite Ajuria Enea, the lehendakari’s (Basque president) residence. In this museum there are paintings by Ignacio Zuloaga, Joaquin Sorolla, Ignacio Diaz de Olano and Fernando Amarica.

Another important art gallery is the Artium (Basque Museum of Contemporary Art) The permanent collection has works by Basque and Spanish artists with paintings, sculptures, prints, photographs and videos made by Chillida, Oteiza, and Moraza, among others. This modern building was opened in 2002 and is on Frantzia Street. 

Bibat is an important museum, devoted to archaeology and playing cards. This museum is in an old renaissance building in Aiztogile Street, recently renovated by the architect Patxi Mangado.

There are other interesting museums such as the Arms Museum in Fray Francisco Walk or the Museum of Natural Sciences in Doña Ochanda Tower, a fort house built in the sixteenth century, in Jesusen Zerbitzarien Fundatzailean Street. Nearby is the Museum of the lanterns in Zapateri street.
Vitoria is also an outdoor museum with sculptures and statues in its streets by contemporary artists such as Oteiza, Ibarrola, Chillida, Casto Solano, Nestor Basterrechea, etc.

Although Vitoria-Gasteiz food is similar to the rest of the Basque Country, the city does have its specialities. "Perretxikos" (Calocybe_gambosa/St. George's mushroom), a type of mushroom, and snails are two traditional dishes of the city.

In early December, the province of Araba holds its "cazuelitas" (small dishes) and wine week. About twenty-five pubs participate, including more than twenty in Vitoria-Gasteiz, and you can eat small portions of local dishes and drink local wines. Another event, Vinogourmet, takes place about the same time. This fair is held in the city’s food market, with wine on the ground floor and pintxos (bar snacks) on the first floor.
There is an important restaurant in the city. Its name is "El Portalon". It is located in a beautiful fifteenth century house. In this restaurant the food is very good.
In 2010, the Ikea restaurant won its first Michelin star.

Tourists say Vitoria-Gasteiz has very good cake-shops.

Leisure in Vitoria refers to several things, music and performing arts, concerts and festivals.

The city’s most famous concerts take place in Los Fueros Square in the Blanca holidays in August, and very important Spanish groups come to Vitoria.

There are also events for the young. Workshops, where children can have fun making thing, for example, Christmas cards.

On the first Saturday of every month there is a market in the old part of the city, where people sell home and beauty products, cheese and other foods and all types of things. Once a year in September there is a medieval market.

At The Principal Theatre you can see plays, shows, dances etc.

There are also a lot of pubs and restaurants to spend the afternoon and evening with friends. The “pintxo-pote” is typical every Thursday in the pubs of Gasteiz, in these the price of a small glass of wine and a snack is €1.

Vitoria is the political and administrative capital of the Basque Country and home of its principal autonomous institutions.
The Basque Parliament is the legislative body of the autonomous region. There are 75 MPs (Members of Parliament),25 of each of the three provinces.
In the current parliament (since 2009), the distribution of seats among the various political parties is as follows: 

Of these MPs, 40 are women, and 35 are men. The current Speaker/President of the Chamber is Arantxa Quiroga.
The Basque Government headquarters are also in the city, in Lakua, and the official residence of the President of the Basque Government is Ajuria Enea, in Fray Francisco Street.
The current Prime Minister is Patxi López.

End–Triassic extinction event

The End–Triassic extinction event marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, 199.6 million years ago. However, many of the extinctions occurred before then in the Upper Triassic.
Overall, this was one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon. It profoundly affected life on land and in the oceans. At least half of the species now known to have been living on Earth at that time went extinct. 

A whole class (conodonts: extinct chordates), 20% of all marine families and all large crurotarsans (non-dinosaurian archosaurs), some remaining therapsids, and many of the large amphibians were wiped out. 

The event emptied many ecological niches, and allowed the dinosaurs to assume the dominant roles in the Jurassic period. This event happened in less than 10,000 years and occurred just before Pangaea started to break apart. 

Several explanations for this event have been suggested, but all have unanswered challenges:

<doc id="275680" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275680" title="Mahakala">
Mahakala

Mahakala is a dromaeosaurid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of 80 million years ago. 

It is based on a partial skeleton found in the Gobi Desert, Mongolia. 

"Mahakala" was a small dromaeosaur, about 70 centimeters long (28 in). Its skeleton shows some features which are also found in early troodontids and avialans. However, its short forearms rule it out of the Alialae.

Despite its late appearance, its structure is that of a basal dromaeosaur. Its small size, and the small size of other basal deinonychosauria, suggests that small size came before flight in birds.

Although this individual was small, comparable in size to "Archaeopteryx", "Caudipteryx", and "Mei", it was close to adulthood. 

This genus can be distinguished from other paravians (dromaeosaurs, troodonts, and birds) by details of the ulna, thighbone, ilium, and tail vertebrae.

It had a typical dromaeosaurid form of the second toe, with an expanded claw. "Mahakala" also had very short forelimbs compared to other Dromaeosaurs.

A phylogenetic analysis performed by Turner and colleagues, who described the specimen, found "Mahakala" to be the most basal known dromaeosaur. Their results, along with the small size of other theropods found at the base of paravian lineages, suggest that small size was not an innovation of early birds, but a common trait of early paravians.

In evolution, small size would have come before flight. Like birds, troodonts and dromaeosaurs did not keep small size throughout their evolutionary history. They had several separate size increases among different lineages. 

"Mahakala" also shows a combination of characteristics found among basal troodonts and birds, and is missing some that are present in more derived (specialised) dromaeosaurs.

The paleoenvironment had a semiarid climate, with sand dunes and alluvium (loose stuff). The semiarid steppe landscape was drained by streams after rain, and was affected by dust and sandstorms. Rainfall was low, and seasonal. 

Animals present included terrestrial turtles and crocodilians, lizards, mammals, and a variety of dinosaurs; aquatic animals like fish were not present. The majority of the fauna was small to medium-sized. 

Small coelurosaurians are the most diverse dinosaurs, including fellow dromaeosaurid "Velociraptor", troodonts "Byronosaurus" and "Saurornithoides", oviraptors "Citipati", "Khaan", and "Oviraptor", and alvarezsaurs "Mononykus" and "Shuvuuia"; other dinosaurs present included the ceratopsian "Protoceratops" and the ankylosaur "Pinacosaurus". Like other dromaeosaurs, "Mahakala" would have been a small, active, predaceous carnivore.

Avialae

Avialae is a term for birds and their immediate extinct ancestors. It is a clade of dinosaurs containing their only living representatives, birds, and whatever coelurosaurs are regarded as their ancestors.

Avialae is defined as clade based on physical characteristics. Jacques Gauthier named Avialae in 1986, and first defined it in 2001 as all dinosaurs that possessed feathered wings used in flapping flight, and the birds that descended from them. 

Several other authors use a similar, but branch-based, definition: all theropods closer to birds than to "Deinonychus".

<doc id="275691" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275691" title="Yatsuhashi">
Yatsuhashi

he origin of Yatsuhashi is come from Yatsuhashi Kengyo, who is the pioneer of making Yatsuhashi. In Edo era, he saved everything so he wanted to make something from the rice that was left in rice chest a little. Then Yatsuhashi was born. After he died, Yatsuhashi was love by people in Kyoto, and now it is very famous food in Kyoto. 

Yatsuhashi is made by rice flour and sugqar cane and a lot of cinnamon. Especially cinnamon is called “Nikkei” and become a essential part of it unique tast.

-100g michiko or glutinous rice flour.

-60g raw cane sugar or light brown sugar.

-1 tsp. ground cinnamon.

-85cc water.
Step1. Mix the dry ingredients together well with chopsticks or a fork, add the water and mix very well. It will be rather loose and sludgy.

Step2. Put back in the microwave and cook on HIGH for 1 minute 30 seconds. Take out and mix again. At this stage it will form a rough ball and more or less clear the sides of the bowl.

Step3. Spread a large piece of heat-proof plastic wrap (like Saran Wrap) on your working surface, and turn the dough out on it.

Step4. Wrap the dough up in the plastic. Knead the dough several times, using the plastic wrap as a heat barrier and to prevent sticking between you, the working surface and the dough. This kneading is very important to ensure the dough is smooth and pliable. You may have to open the plastic wrap and re-shift the dough a few times. Keep kneading until the dough is smooth and shiny.

Step5. Mix the 3 Tbs. of kinako and 1 Tbs. of cinnamon, and use this as the dusting ‘flour’ to roll out the dough as thinly as possible. It helps to use more plastic wrap to prevent sticking here. If you have trouble getting it thin enough, try dividing the dough and rolling out smaller pieces.

Step6. Cut the dough into 10 to 12 squares. Wet two sides, fill with about 1/2 tsp. of filling, fold up into a triangle and press hard to seal. I then like to coat them again in the kinako-cinnamon powder mix, and dust on extra cinnamon to serve, but this is optional.

Izutsu Yatsuhashi was established by Sahei Tsuda in 1805. At one of the Izutsu yatsuhashi shops, Kyogoku Ichibangai, people can make their own yatsuhashi. 

In 1946, a confectionery retail store was started at the Kawaramachirokkaku. In1949, the store started to sell yatsuhashi. In 1969, the name of company has changed to “Otabe”. In 2010, Otabe’s Choco-Yatsuhashi won a special gold prize in Monde Selection. 

The history of Honke Nishino Yatsuhashi began in 1687 in the Edo period, so three hundred years have passed. It has a long story. At the time, “Shiramochi” which is like old raw yatsuhashi was sold there. 

Besides these yatsuhashi stores, there are famous shops in Kyoto. They are 'Goden Yatsuhashi, 'Seikodo', 'Hakushindo', and 'HonkeNishio'.

Izutsu Yatsuhashi: This is a confection from a famous shop shaped like a long Japanese zither with thirteen strings. It has been sold for more than 200 years. 

Nama-Yatsuhashi: This is tender taste.

Yuko: This is a lyric confection containing bean jam. This is a Yatsuhashi which is associated with Yuko who is a heroine of “the gobantyo-yugirirou".

Other taste: chocolate, powdered green tea, salt, and sesami.

Yatsuhashi: This is a confection from Kyoto which has been loved by people since more than 300 years ago.

Choco-Yatsuhashi: This is the original confection of Otabe. Yatsuhashi is baked thin, and then it is coated in chocolate.

Nama-Yatsuhashi: This is tender dough which is baked.

Yatsuhashi: This is crisp.
Tastes: powdered green tea, sesami, and banana.

Pocket-Yatsuhashi: This is a Yatsuhashi which you can carry in your pocket.
Tastes: cacao, strawberry, and powdered green tea.

Mezzanine is the third studio album by English trip hop group Massive Attack, released on 20 April 1998. It was produced by Neil Davidge along with the group. The album was released on Virgin Records.

The entire album was provided on their website for legal download many months before the CD release was announced. It was one of the first major uses of the MP3 format by a commercial organization.
It does not use the jazzy sounds and the rapping of Tricky in "Blue Lines" and "Protection", leaving in favour a dark sound, heavy bass lines and distorted guitars.

Telephone (song)

"Telephone" is a song by American singer Lady Gaga from her third EP The Fame Monster, featuring American R&B singer Beyoncé Knowles. The main inspiration of the song was Gaga's fear of not being able to enjoy herself because of her career, hence the lyrics show the singer as wanting the dance floor, rather than answering her lover's phone calls.

Gaga explained that the telephone addressed in the lyrics of the song, is in reality a person telling her to continue working harder. Musically, the song is made of an expanded bridge, verse-rap and an epilogue, where the voice of an operator says that the phone line is not reachable. Knowles appears in the middle of the song, singing the verses in a rapid-fire way, accompanied by double beats.

"Telephone" was appreciated by contemporary critics who many times noted it as a stand-out track from "The Fame Monster".

Flavivirus

Flavivirus is a genus of the family Flaviviridae. This genus includes the West Nile virus, Dengue fever virus, Tick-borne Encephalitis Virus, Yellow fever virus, and several other viruses which may cause encephalitis.

"Flavivirus" are share a common size 40-65 nm.
Flaviviruses are named from the yellow fever virus, a type virus for the Flaviviridae family; flavus means yellow in Latin. Yellow fever in turn was named because of its propensity to cause yellow jaundice in victims.[2]
Flaviviruses share a common size (40-65 nm), symmetry (enveloped, icosahedral nucleocapsid), nucleic acid (positive-sense, single stranded RNA approximately 10,000–11,000 bases), and appearance in the electron microscope.
These viruses are transmitted by the bite from an infected arthropod (mosquito or tick). Human infections with these viruses are typically incidental, as humans are unable to replicate the virus to high enough titres to reinfect arthropods and thus continue the virus life cycle. The exceptions to this are yellow fever and dengue viruses, which still require mosquito vectors, but are well-enough adapted to humans as to not necessarily depend upon animal hosts (although both continue have important animal transmission routes as well).
Other virus transmission routes include handling infected animal carcasses, blood transfusion, child birth and through consumption of unpasteurised milk products. The transmission from animals to humans without an intermediate vector arthropod is thought to be unlikely. For example, early tests with yellow fever showed that the disease is not a contagious disease.

Hinamatsuri, the Doll’s Festival, is held on 3 March, which is called "momono sekku" in Japan. Japanese families that have young girls display "Hinaningyou" in their houses. They are decorated with peach blossoms, grilled bits of rice cake, sweet white liquor called sake and so forth from middle of February to end of the day. The family should immediately put the dolls away. If the dolls are not put away on the evening of the day, the girl will not marry at the proper time.
The origin of the Japanese Doll’s Festival is an ancient China. At the time, the Chinese transferred their bad thoughts and disasters to dolls, which they then tossed into a river so that they would flow away with the dolls. This custom represents the ritual purification of evil influence. In Japan, girls have been playing with these dolls and this custom has been celebrated since the Edo era (1603-1868), about 300 years ago.

Benoît de Maillet

Benoît de Maillet (Saint-Mihiel, 12 April 1656 – Marseille, 30 January 1738) was a well-travelled French diplomat and naturalist. 

He was French consul general at Cairo, and overseer in the Levant. He formulated an evolutionary hypothesis to explain the Earth and its contents. 

Maillet's geological observations convinced him that the Earth could not have been created in an instant because the features of the crust indicate a slow development by natural processes. He also believed that creatures on the land were ultimately derived from creatures living in the seas. He believed in the natural origin of man. 

Maillet made the first reasonable estimate of the Earth's age based on evidence. He thought the Earth must have developed by slow, natural forces. He studied geology in the field. He could see signs of erosion on land and sedimentation in the sea. 

He hid his ideas under the guise of a talk with an Indian philosopher, to avoid conflict with the Catholic Church. His work stayed in manuscript until after his death, when it was published after its editor had made changes which damaged it. Now there is a better modern edition based on the manuscripts. 

Maillet estimated that the Earth was older than two billion years. He also recognized the true nature of fossils, and had early ideas about evolution.

Heinrich Biber

Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber von Bibern (baptised 12 August 1644 – died 3 May 1704) was a Bohemian-Austrian composer and violinist. He was the most famous German violinist of his time. He is particularly famous for his violin sonatas.

Biber was born in a small Bohemian town near Reichenberg. Nothing is known about his music education. We know that in the mid-1660s he went to work for Prince-Bishop Karl, Count Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn of Olomouc. The prince loved music and kept many musicians at his court. During the winter of 1670-1671 Biber became a member of the Kapelle at Salzburg court. He was married there in 1672. There he played the violin and trained the choirboys and composed a lot of music. He probably had a lot of contact with other well-known musicians such as Georg Muffat. Although he was the greatest virtuoso of his time he hardly seems to have travelled about to play.

In 1690 Biber was raised to the nobility. During his last years he seems to have spent much of his time composing works for the theatre as well as sacred music.

This simple usage should suffice for a great many stub templates. Additional parameters are described below for advanced use.

If the image is called with an icon template, codice_1 is set to the full syntax of the template; that's the name of the template, plus any arguments (separated with | ), including the codice_4 around it. Icon can also be used to provide the full image markup (include the opening and closing square brackets), if special image settings such as "border" are to be used. If the image is called explicitly codice_2 is the name of the image :- codice_6 will likely be required as well, the default value for codice_6 is 40x30.

codice_8 may be used to override the default which is set to "Stub icon".

The size of the image in pixels (no need to append px). Only "required" if codice_2 is used and this image requires a size different from the default maximum of 40x30 pixels. (Note that in the interests of standardising the formats of stub messages, images of size 40x30 are much preferred.)

Category theory is a type of mathematics. Category theorists show how different ideas in mathematics are the same. For example, some ideas from Topology and Abstract Algebra are similar. Ideas in category theory are written down in formulas or diagrams.

Category theory can be used to make computer programs more secure or easy to write.

A category is a mathematical object. It can be drawn with dots and arrows. Each arrow goes from one dot to one other dot. There can be many dots, sometimes so many that you can not count them.

Composition is a way to make a new arrow out of two arrows. If two arrows form an elbow shape, then they have a composition arrow from the start of the first to the end of the second. Composition obeys some axioms, or equations.

Many ideas in abstract algebra are examples of categories or can be used to make categories. Often, this makes the ideas seem more similar.

Quango

Quango is an acronym used especially in the United Kingdom and the Ireland. It means an organisation which the government has given devolved power (that is, hived off). 

The acronym is spelt out in various ways:
• "quasi non-governmental organisation",
• "quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation", 
• "quasi-autonomous national government organisation" 
• In the United Kingdom the official term is "non-departmental public body" or NDPB.

The term 'quasi-autonomous non-governmental organization' was created in 1967 by the Carnegie Foundation's Alan Pifer. He wrote an essay on independence and accountability in public-funded bodies. This term was shortened to 'quango' by Anthony Barker, a Briton, during a follow-up conference. 

Many quangos were created from the 1980s onwards. The UK government's definition in 1997 of a non-departmental public body or quango was:

According to the Tax Payers Alliance, in the year 2006-07, tax payers funded 1,162 Quangos at a cost of nearly £64bn; equivalent to £2,550 per household. About a thousand still remain.

Since Scotland was given devolved self-government in 1999, their government has also set up a number of quangos.

The Republic of Ireland in 2006 had more than 800 quangos, 482 at national and 350 at local level, with a total of 5,784 individual appointees and a combined annual budget of €13 billion.

Depending upon one's point of view, the separation of a quango from government might allow its functions to be more commercially exercised. Or else it might allow an elected minister to evade responsibility for spending public money. Quangos have been criticised as undemocratic, expensive and letting government grow too big.

"The Times" has accused quangos of bureaucratic waste and excess. In 2005 Dan Lewis, author of "The Essential Guide to Quangos", claimed that many quangos were useless and duplicated the work of others. In August 2008 a report by the right-leaning pressure group the Taxpayers' Alliance, claimed that £15 billion was being wasted by the regional development agencies, quangos set up to encourage economic development in their regions.

Before becoming a professional, Lewicki was at the centre of a dispute over professional hockey signing practices. , Lewicki is the only player to have won the Allan Cup, Memorial Cup and Stanley Cup while still a junior.

Lewicki was one of eight children in the family of Michael and Anastasia Lewicki. Both Michael and Anastasia were born in Ukraine and emigrated to Canada where they met in Fort William, Ontario. The family lived in the area known as the "Coal Docks", an immigrant enclave near the docks in Fort William. The family shared a home with six boarders. In an abusive marriage, Anastasia left Michael when Daniel was two years of age. Two of the children were sent to Geraldton, Ontario where the eldest sister lived with her husband. Daniel, his mother, a sister and brother and a boarder lived in a two-room shack by .

Lewicki started skating at age five, first with bob skates, then a used pair three sizes too large. Until age twelve, Lewicki learned to play hockey by playing shinny on outdoor rinks. Organized hockey started at age twelve and Lewicki joined the Bantam Elks. This he did in secret, as his mother was strongly opposed to his playing hockey. Lewicki would hide his hockey equipment outside under the backyard stairs. The next season, Lewicki played for the North Star Bantams, moving up to the Midgets at age fourteen a year early, to play against boys sixteen and older.

At age fifteen, Lewicki got his first taste of junior hockey with the Columbus Juniors in their playoffs against the Winnipeg Monarchs. Lewicki would return to the Columbus Juniors the following season. That season, Lewicki would lead the Fort William league in scoring, and started attracting the attention of pro scouts from Toronto, New York and Detroit. Lewicki did not sign with any team, but was placed on the negotiating list of the Providence Reds by his coach, Leo Barbini, who did some scouting for the Reds. Barbini somehow managed to put Lewicki on the Providence list before Toronto and New York, who had filed at 12:01 am on Lewicki's sixteenth birthday.

The following season, Columbus would be defeated by the Port Arthur West End Bruins. After the series, Lewicki was invited to join the Bruins as they continued in junior series playoffs. The Bruins would defeat Winnipeg to advance to the Western title series against Lethbridge, Alberta. Port Arthur and Lethbridge would be tied 3–3 in a best-of-seven series. Lethbridge refused to play the seventh game in Port Arthur and the game was moved to Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens. The large ice surface favoured the Bruins and they defeated Lethbridge 11–1 to advance to the 1948 Memorial Cup final against the Barrie Flyers. The Bruins would defeat the Flyers in four straight to win the Cup and Lewicki would score the series-winning goal. The club had an impressive array of talent. Eight players from the Bruins would go on to play in the NHL. Lewicki was the top scorer in the playoffs, recording 40 points.

After the Cup, the Toronto Maple Leafs bought the rights to Lewicki for a record price of $35,000 and a player. In the fall, Lewicki left Port Arthur to join the Stratford Kroehlers, coached by Barbini, his old coach. Before the regular season started, Lewicki was ordered to join the Toronto Marlboros by the Maple Leafs. Unbeknownst to Lewicki, Barbini had signed Lewicki to a "C" Form, which bound Lewicki at age eighteen, and not simply signed Lewicki to a negotiating list. 

Lewicki refused to play for Toronto, but was told that he had to play for the Marlboros, or nowhere else. Lewicki received a telegram from NHL President Clarence Campbell advising him that he was suspended. The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association took up Lewicki's case, but the CAHA stopped backing Lewicki short of any legal action. Stratford did as well, in the face of pressure from the Maple Leafs. Lewicki decided to join the Marlboros. The "C" Form, which Lewicki signed, became an issue in the Canadian Parliament, and was abolished a few years later.

The Marlboros were defeated in the playoffs that year, and, like in Port Arthur, Lewicki was invited to join another team on a playoff run. This time it was the Marlboros' senior team, in competition for the Allan Cup. The Marlboros defeated the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen, then the Cornwall Calumets, the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds and the Sherbrooke Saints to advance to the 1950 Allan Cup final against the Calgary Stampeders. Lewicki would be named the MVP for the series as the Marlboros defeated Calgary 4–1. Lewicki scored 42 points in the 17 playoff games.

In 1950, Lewicki began his National Hockey League career with the Maple Leafs. As a nineteen-year-old, he made the team straight out of training camp. Lewicki was able to get a one-way contract at $10,000 for three years and a signing bonus of $3,000. Lewicki made his NHL debut on October 14, 1950 against the Chicago Black Hawks. In his seventh game, Lewicki scored his first NHL goal on a bounce off the glass that bounced off the back of the Boston Bruins Jack Gelineau. Lewicki became a contender for the Calder Trophy, although he had strong competition from future Hall of Famer Terry Sawchuk. Lewicki had 16 goals and 31 assists before a groin injury ended his season early. Lewicki would end up third in voting for the Calder. The team finished second to qualify for the playoffs. Lewicki was pressed into service on the orders of Conn Smythe, although he was not healed. To play he had to have his groin muscle frozen and taped before each game. Instead of being able to contribute as a scorer, Lewicki would play a checking role in the playoffs. The Leafs would defeat the Montreal Canadiens in the final 4–1 to win the 1951 Stanley Cup Final. Lewicki was an Allan Cup, Memorial Cup and Stanley Cup winner at the age of 20.

Lewicki spent the next three seasons mainly with the Leafs' Pittsburgh Hornets. Smythe was mad at Lewicki for getting married during the 1951 off-season. In Smythe's memoirs, he later regretted demoting a player to the minors for getting married, without naming the player. Lewicki may be the player, but he is not the only player to be demoted for that reason. Lewicki and another Leaf player John McCormack were both demoted following marriages. Despite a 36 goal, 45 assist and 81 point season in Pittsburgh, in 1954, the Maple Leafs sold Lewicki to the New York Rangers. Back in the NHL, Lewicki would respond with the best NHL season of his career, scoring 29 goals and 24 assists in 70 games and was named to the NHL Second All-Star team. 

After the 1957–58 season, the Rangers left him unprotected for the annual intra-league draft, and Lewicki became Montreal Canadiens property. Although he had a good training camp, and earned a bonus for his play, he was shipped to the Chicago Black Hawks. Lewicki and other players who had been picked from the Rangers' system were picked by the Canadiens simply to hurt the Rangers and the Canadiens had no plans to play them. 

Lewicki played one season for the Black Hawks, who managed to make the playoffs, only to lose in the first round. In the final game of the playoff, referee Red Storey missed a tripping call leading to a series winning goal by the Canadiens. The fans at Chicago Stadium were threatening Storey, and Lewicki gave Storey his stick to defend himself. Lewicki was unhappy after sitting on the bench, and he handed Storey his stick, saying "you need it more than me." Storey used the stick to defend himself to exit the arena. It would be both Storey and Lewicki's last game in the NHL. Storey resigned after criticism from league president Campbell, and the Black Hawks would sent Lewicki to the minors. Lewicki contends that the incident led to him being 'black-balled' from the league as he received no call-ups or any chances to make another NHL club for the rest of his career. Lewicki played for a few seasons in the American Hockey League before retiring in 1963.

Jundallah

Jundallah (or Jondallah, translates to Soldiers of God), or People's resistance movement of Iran' (PRMI) is a militant organisation based in Balochistan. The organisation claims to be fighting for the rights of Sunni muslims in Iran. Most muslims in Iran are Shi'a, Sunni make up for the largest group that is not Shi'a. Iran says the group is a terrorist organisation. Iran has blamed the organisation for many acts of smuggling illegal drugs, and of kidnapping. The organisation is believed to have 1.000 fighting soldiers. 

Many observers believe the group is linked to al-Qaeda. For a long time, Iran has believed that the U.S. government supported Jundallah. Several other sources such as the ABC News, Daily Telegraph, and journalist Seymour Hersh have also reported that Jundullah has received support from the United States against the government of Iran, although the US denies any involvement.

In August 2007, the Israeli Mossad chief, Meir Dagan, pushed for using ethnic groups (among others, people from Balochistan) in Iran to make the Iranian government weaker and try to change the people in charge of the government.

Solingen arson attack of 1993

The Solingen arson attack of 1993 happened on the night of 29 May 1993 when five Turkish people died in Solingen, Germany. They died when four young German men, belonging to the political far right, firebombed a house. The dead were women and children, aged four, nine, 12, 18 and 27, all of whom who were related.

The attack caused many protests in Germany, and many German government officials were at a memorial service for the dead. Some of the protests were violent, but others were peaceful.

Because of the attack, Germany decided to make sure fewer people from other countries came into Germany for political asylum. It also banned some right-wing political groups.

On 14 October 1995, a Germany court sentenced the four people who did the attack. Three men, aged 18, 19 and 22, were given prison terms of ten years. The fourth man, 25, was given a term of 15 years. The sentences were opposed by the men and their families, though most of the Turkish people in Germany approved of them. Some Turkish people wanted the men to get life terms in jail.

<doc id="275861" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275861" title="Solder">
Solder

Solder is a metal or alloy that melts at a low temperature. There are two types of solder; soft solder and hard solder. Soft solder melts easily with soldering irons and is used for electronics and electrical work. Hard solder melts at a higher temperature with a torch. Using solder is called soldering. 
There are two main types of soft solder; lead solder and lead-free solder. Lead solders have about 60% (or 63%) tin and 40% (or 37%) lead in them. They are toxic because they have lead in them. They melt at around 185°C. Lead solder is cheap, so it used to be popular. In plumbing, a 50% tin and 50% lead mixture was used. People thought this was safe, but then they saw that the lead was coming into the water. Now lead solder is illegal for water. Lead solder was once used for food cans. After many years, the lead could come into the food. The cans poisoned people who ate the food. Lead solder is still used in electronics.

In 2006 the European Union, China, and California banned lead in consumer products. Lead solder became illegal in electronic devices in some places. Lead-free solder was needed. Many lead-free solders have tin, silver, and copper in them. They melt around 217°C. Sometimes indium is added to the solder to make it better, but indium is very expensive.
Many times when a metal is being soldered, it oxidizes, making a layer of metal oxide that does not hold solder. Flux is added to react with the metal oxide and turn it back into the metal again. That helps the solder connect to the metal. Rosin is a common flux. Some electronics makers use fluxes that can be washed away with water. Some solders have a flux core, where the flux is inside the solder.

Another type of solder is used to connect glass to other things. They melt around 450-550°C.

<doc id="275862" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275862" title="Frame-dragging">
Frame-dragging

Frame dragging is a theory which says that space is elastic, and particles in it will exchange energy with it. In the scientific world, "elastic" means that when you apply a certain amount of force to an object (which will cause it to bend) and then remove the force, the object will return to its original shape and energy state. Also, space is referred to as spacetime, which is simply a way to bring together the concepts of space and time together. This basically means that whenever space is affected, time is affected. Frame dragging would provide answers for very old questions about gravity, strong force, and wave-particle duality (how things like electrons can act like waves and particles at the same time).

In frame dragging, particles spin, and this spin has energy in it. (It is important to note that this is not quantum physics spin, but an actual angular momentum spin; the particles are actually spinning). Since spacetime is elastic in this theory, it can absorb the energy (spin) of the particle. This would slow down the spin of the particle. 

Mass has a strange effect that we experience in the normal world: it attracts other mass. Scientists have been spending centuries trying to explain this occurrence. Recently, they have discovered that mass has an effect that it can curve spacetime. This means that when mass is present, the shortest path through spacetime between two points is slightly bent towards wherever the mass is. 

Since the energy absorbed by spacetime has to go somewhere, many scientists predict that spacetime would be "bunched up," or folded. This can also be phrased as a curvature (bend) in spacetime. This would indicate that the particle generated gravity. The reason that this theory is called "frame dragging" is probably due to the effect of particles effectively "dragging" or "grabbing" spacetime as they spin. Not only would space be curved, but time would as well.

However, the way to imagine this "gravity" is not so much as the force that we normally consider when we think of gravity, since normal gravity is created as well (due to its mass). Basically, frame dragging is an effect that occurs when one object is moving near another, which makes both objects change their motion because of the other's motion. Frame dragging does not occur if an object is neither spinning nor moving. In effect, one object "deflects" the motion of the other, and the other way around.

Scientists such as Einstein and Schrödinger spent much of their lives trying to find an answer for how can something like an electron act like a wave and also act like a particle. Frame dragging states that since spacetime is elastic, it can also give the spin-energy back to the particle. Once the particle has all of its spin-energy given back to it, it acts most like a wave. At that point, it will once again begin using its energy bunching up spacetime. Once the particle is no longer spinning, it acts most like a particle. Then, spacetime begins giving the particle its energy back, and the cycle continues forever. This is how a particle can actually act like a particle and a wave at nearly the same time. No energy is lost during the cycle due to the conservation of energy.

Frame dragging also has an effect that if one particle is next to another, they can both save energy if one is absorbing energy as the other one is emitting it. (This can also increase the mass of both particles, using Einstein's famous equation that energy is equal to a certain amount of mass). This would encourage particles to group together, which would explain what strong force (a force that holds protons and neutrons in an atom nucleus together) is.

There are effects that come out of the math of the frame dragging theory. Scientists are currently testing one which is that if one small spinning object is orbiting a larger spinning object, the smaller object will slowly adjust its spin axis (the imaginary line which an object rotates around) to align with the larger object's spin axis. This is known as the Lense-Thirring effect. They are testing this theory by having a gyroscope (an object that will normally keep its spin axis the same) orbit the Earth, and testing whether its spin axis will align with the Earth's spin axis. So far, scientist say that they have evidence that proves the Lense-Thirring effect (and possibly the frame dragging theory) to less than .5% accuracy.

NEES

"The George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation" or NEES is created by the National Science Foundation to give researchers the tools to learn how earthquakes and tsunamis impact buildings, bridges, utility systems and other critical components of civil infrastructure.
NEES is a network of 15 large-scale, experimental sites that incorporate shake-tables, centrifuges that simulate earthquake effects, unique laboratories, a tsunami wave basin and field-testing equipment. All are linked to a centralized data pool and earthquake simulation software, bridged together by the high-speed Internet. The new NEEShub system, a communications web that uses collaborative tools and tele-presence technologies, allows off-site researchers to interact in real time with any of the networked sites.

With these tools, engineers and students from all parts of the country can collaborate on multi-site experiments using simulators that generate earthquake effects strong enough to bring down full-sized buildings.

From that knowledge will come a new set of rules from which engineers can design structures and materials that will better withstand earthquake forces.

Stibine

Stibine, also known as antimony hydride or hydrogen antimonide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SbH. It is a covalent compound. It could be seen as having antimonide and hydrogen ions, or antimony and hydride ions. 

Stibine is a colorless gas. It is very toxic. It has a bad smell like hydrogen sulfide. Its structure is similar to ammonia. It can be found in the Marsh test, a test for arsenic. Antimony is reacted with a mixture of zinc and hydrochloric acid in a tube, making stibine. The stibine is heated and a shiny area of antimony is made in the heated part of the tube. 

Stibine easily decomposes into antimony and hydrogen at room temperature. This decomposition can be explosive. It burns very easily in air to make antimony trioxide and water. It can be deprotonated by very strong bases. Stibine melts at -88°C and boils at -17°C.

Stibine was first found in 1837. It was difficult to find its properties because people did not know of a good way to make it. In 1901, Alfred Stock found a good way to make this gas and found most of its properties.

Stibine is made by reacting any antimonide with a strong acid. Some antimonides react with water to make this gas. Stibine can also be made by reacting any antimony(III) compound such as antimony trioxide with any hydride.

Stibine is used to dope semiconductors with antimony. Some claim that it is used as a fumigant, but phosphine works much better.

Stibine is a highly toxic gas, similar in toxicity to phosphine. It is too unstable to be of any hazard outside the laboratory, though.

Protection (album)

Protection (1994) is Bristol-based trip-hop band Massive Attack's second album.

"Protection" was featured in the top ten of "Rolling Stone" magazine's 'Coolest Albums of All Time List,' calling it "great music for when you're driving around a city at 4 am," due to the 'chill out' nature of the album. Like most of Massive Attack's albums, the music often forgets about categorisation, ranging from R&B (title track, Sly) to hip hop/rap (Karmacoma, Eurochild) to reggae-tinged synthpop (Spying Glass) to classical-influenced electronica instrumentals (Weather Storm, Heat Miser).

Paul Evans of "Rolling Stone" gave the album three and a half of five stars calling it "Cool, sexy stuff, it smoothly fuses dub, club and soul, grounding its grace in sampled hip-hop beats."

It is the second and last Massive Attack album listed in the book "1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die".

The track "Karmacoma" featured vocals from Tricky, and the video was directed by Jonathan Glazer. The song also features a sample from the track "Dream Time in Lake Jackson" by The KLF, which can be found 2:00 minutes in.

DJ Mad Professor remixed the album in 1995 under the name "No Protection".

Blue Lines

Blue Lines is the first album by British electronica group Massive Attack, released on 8 April 1991 (see 1991 in music) by Virgin Records. 

"Blue Lines" is usually considered the first trip hop album, although the term was not used commonly until years later. The album was a success in the United Kingdom, reaching #13 in the albums chart; sales were limited elsewhere. A mix of electronic music, hip hop, dub music, '70s soul music and reggae, the album established Massive Attack as one of the most best British bands of the 1990s and the founder of trip hop's Bristol Sound. Music critic Simon Reynolds stated that the album also marked a change in electronic/dance music, "a shift toward a more interior, meditational sound. The songs on "Blue Lines" run at 'spliff' tempos — from a mellow, moonwalking 90 beats per minute ...down to a positively torpid 67 bpm." The group also drew inspiration from concept albums in various genres by artists such as Pink Floyd, Public Image Ltd., Billy Cobham, Herbie Hancock and Isaac Hayes.

"Blue Lines" featured breakbeats, sampling, and rapping on a number of tracks, but the design of the album differed from common hip hop. Massive Attack approached the American-born hip hop movement from an underground British perspective, as well as incorporating live instruments into the mixes. It features the vocals of Shara Nelson and Horace Andy, along with the rapping of Tricky Kid. "Blue Lines" proved to be popular in the club scene, as well as on college radio stations. 

Daddy G said about the making of the album:

Marie Louise d'Orléans

Marie Louise d'Orléans (26 March 1662 – 12 February 1689) was the first wife of King Charles II of Spain. She was a granddaughter of Louis XIII of France. In her adopted country, she was known as "Maria Luisa de Orléans".

Marie Louise d'Orléans was born at the Palais Royal in Paris and was the eldest daughter of Philippe of France and Henrietta of England. 

Charming, pretty and graceful, Marie Louise was her father's favourite and she had a happy childhood. Marie Louise spent a lot of time with both her grandmothers - Anne of Austria and Queen Henrietta Maria. For a time she was raised with the future Queen Anne I of Great Britain, her first cousin who lived in France till 1670. Marie Louise's mother died the same year and her father married Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate in 1671. All her life, Marie Louise would maintain an affectionate correspondence with her stepmother. 

She was forced to marry Charles II of Spain. The proxy marriage ceremony took place at the Palace of Fontainebleau on 30 August 1679. On 19 November 1679, Marie Louise and Charles II were married in-person in Quintanapalla, near Burgos, Spain. This was the start of a very lonely existence at the Spanish court. Her new husband had fallen madly in love with her, whose beauty and charm were renowned, and his passion for her remained with him until the end of his life. The very rigid etiquette of the Spanish Court (it was even forbidden to touch the Queen), and her unsuccessful attempts to bear a child, however, caused her to suffer from depression. 

Her French attendants were all accused of plotting against the king and his family and, as a result, one of her personal maids was tortured under allegations. Due to the nature of the times, and the Spanish Court’s hatred of the young French princess, there were even riots outside the Palace in Madrid where she resided. 

After years of trying and of increasing homesickness of her happy years in France with her family, Marie Louise turned to food. During the last years of her life, she became overweight. After horseback riding on 11 February 1689, she felt a severe pain in the abdomen which forced her to lie down the rest of the evening. She died the following night. 

Her husband was heartbroken at the death of his wife. At the time, there were rumours that she had been poisoned but it seems likely that the real cause of Marie Louise's death was appendicitis. Shortly after the Queen's death, the Spanish ministers began to look for a second wife for the King. The main candidates were the Tuscan princess Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici and the Maria Anna of Neuburg and the latter was chosen. Charles II died childless in 1700 ending the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg.

She was born a Princess of Savoy in Paris. Married by proxy to Charles of Lorraine in 1662, Lorraine soon refused to recognise the union. Despite this, she married Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy in 1665 who was her second cousin once removed. The mother of the future Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia who saw the elevation of the House of Savoy to kings, she styled herself as Madama Reale or Madame Royale and acted as Regent of Savoy from 1675 in the name of her son Victor Amadeus II who was his successor. Her regency officially ended in 1680 but she maintained power for four years until her son banished her from further influence in the state. She left a considerable architectural legacy in Turin and was responsible for the remodelling of the Palazzo Madama which was her private residence. At the time of her death she was the mother of the King of Sardinia as well as great grandmother of the King of Spain and King of France.

Charles Emmanuel II (20 June 1634 – 12 June 1675) was the Duke of Savoy from 1638 to 1675 and under regency of his mother Christine Marie of France until 1663. He was also the claimant king of Cyprus and Jerusalem. At his death in 1675 his second wife Marie Jeanne of Savoy acted as Regent for their eleven year old son. 

He was born in Turin to Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy and Christine Marie of France. In 1638 at the death of his older brother Francis Hyacinth, Duke of Savoy, Charles Emmanuel succeeded to the duchy of Savoy at the age of 4. His mother governed in his place, and even after reaching adulthood, Charles Emmanuel continued a life of pleasure, far away from the affairs of state. 

Only after the death of his mother in 1663, he really assumed power. 

But he greatly improved commerce and wealth in the Duchy, developing the port of Nice and building a road through the Alps towards France. He also reformed the army by forming five Piedmontese regiments and recreated cavalry, as well as introducing uniforms. He also restored fortifications. He constructed many beautiful buildings in Turin, for instance the Palazzo Reale where he died. He is buried at Turin Cathedral. 

Charles Emmanuel married twice.

Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia

Victor Amadeus II (Vittorio Amedeo Sebastiano; 14 May 1666 – 31 October 1732) was Duke of Savoy from 1675 to 1730. He also held the titles of Marquis of Saluzzo, Duke of Montferrat, Prince of Piedmont, Count of Aosta, Moriana and Nizza. 

He was the only child born to Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy and Marie Jeanne of Savoy. At his fathers death in 1675, his mother took over a regency in the name of her nine year old son and would remain in de facto power till 1684 when Victor Amadeus banished her further involvement in the state. Louis XIV organised his marriage to Anne Marie d'Orléans in order to maintain French influence in the Duchy but Victor Amadeus soon broke away from the influence of France. Anne Marie was a devoted wife but Victor Amadeus did not love her. 

Having fought in the War of the Spanish Succession, he became king of Sicily in 1713 but he was forced to exchange this title and instead became king of Sardinia to which his direct descendants claim as part of the Kingdom of Italy. He abdicated in 1730 and the crown was inherited by his son Charles Emmanuel III. Victor Amadeus left a considerable cultural influence in Turin remodelling the Royal Palace of Turin, Palace of Venaria, Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi as well as building the Basilica of Superga where he rests.

His distant relationship with his mother was always strained and has been blamed on her ambition to keep power to herself. Marie Jeanne spent most of her time relegated to state business which she enjoyed and had little time for her only child whom she kept under close supervision in order to make sure he would try to assume power. Anne Marie gave her husband six children but also had two stillbirths of each gender one in 1691 and again in 1697. Three of these children would go on to have further progeny including the eldest Maria Adelaide who was the mother of Louis XV of France. His second daughter Maria Luisa known in the family as "Louison" would marry Philip V of Spain in 1701 and was also regent of Spain for various periods. These two marriages were tactics used by Louis XIV to keep Victor Amadeus close to France prior to the War of the Spanish Succession.

Anne Marie would remain a devoted wife. She quietly accepted his extramarital affairs the longest one being with the famed beauty Jeanne Baptiste d'Albert de Luynes by whom he had two children. Jeanne Baptiste was his mistress for eleven years and eventually fled Savoy due to Victor Amadeus' obsession with her. Victor Amadeus subsequently had his daughter including the future Maria Vittoria marry the Prince of Carignan from which the present Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples is a direct descendant. His favourite child was Victor Amadeus born in 1699 and given the title Prince of Piedmont as heir apparent. At the death of the Prince of Piedmont in 1715 from smallpox Victor Amadeus II was very upset. His devoted wife Anne Marie died in 1728 after a series of heart attacks.

His relationship with his younger son and eventual successor Charles Emmanuel was a cold one and the two were never close. Victor Amadeus organised the first two marriages of Charles Emmanuel the first one being to Anne Christine of Sulzbach, daughter of the Count Palatine of Sulzbach which produced a son which died in infancy. The second marriage was to Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg a first cousin of Anne Christine and mother of six children including the future Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia.
