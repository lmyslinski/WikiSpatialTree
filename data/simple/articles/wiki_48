Zhuangzi

Zhuangzi (莊子) lived and taught around 350 B.C. He was a Daoist philosopher who wrote a book which is also called Zhuangzi. His name is also written as "Chuang Tzu," and there are several other romanizations (writing in Roman letters) of his name.

The Zhuangzi advocates that men distance themselves from the traditional prestige and honor of worldly life, and think about what it means to simply live. The Zhuangzi tells a story about two ministers who ask Zhuangzi to serve as a court official. Zhuangzi replies with a story about a sacred turtle. He says, "The king's men caught a sacred turtle. They killed it and put its shell in a special box to use to tell the future. Now would that turtle rather be honored in that box and dead, or would he rather be alive dragging his tail through the mud?"

Just a thought, but perhaps we should clear user warnings that are over a year old and effectively stale, especially with dynamic IP ranges? Some IP talk pages are getting quite long with warnings dating back to 2006, and i'm not entirely sure vandals will scroll all the way to the bottom of the page if they "have new messages".

This could be particularly useful for IP addresses that have vandalised in the past but now (seem to) have turned over a new leaf.

Regards,

I don't agree, I think old warnings should stay because it helps determine if ip ranges are locations likely to be vandalism hot spots. I use old vandalism warnings as a way to decide things all the time. Wikipedia is not paper and we are not running out of space. And I can't imagine anyone spends a whole lot of time looking at IP users talk pages without reason. If a IP talk page is cluttered I just refactor the comments to make them easier to read. For the example BG uses of warnigns dating back to 2006, if the page is above the recommended page size of 60k just create an archive like any regular users talk page, atleast thats what happens on en (oh I know dirty word). - () 14:35, 3 April 2009 (UTC)

Why don't we hide old messages using a collapsible navbox or something similar? Example:

This would allow users to research past warnings and incidents and save space. () () 15:44, 3 April 2009 (UTC)

I love that idea! Maybe the box style could change a little bit, but I love the concept very, very much. 06:13, 5 April 2009 (UTC)

How about the enWP talkpag yellow for the box? -- 17:02, 5 April 2009 (UTC)

At there is Charles Kay Ogden's Basic English wordlist. Ogden died in 1957, so in countries where copyright is 70 years after the author's death, his copyright has not yet expired. The list was deleted from Wiktionary for this reason. So I am curious what the justification is for keeping the list on a free encyclopedia. () 22:26, 5 April 2009 (UTC)

Hello all. Just in case you hadn't noticed the demotions link in the RecentChanges template go bold (indicating there's an active nomination), I discovered a fair number of problems with the Joss Whedon article. In light of recent GA standards, I now believe the current state of this article warrants its demotion from GA. Comments, suggestions, or someone saving it from demotion, or any combination of the above would be appreciated at . Cheers y'all. () 17:44, 6 April 2009 (UTC)

I cannot think of any user categories that are actually useful for this project. I propose each and every single one is deleted. 23:03, 28 March 2009 (UTC)




I have removed the user category RFDs from as this discussion covers them as well and the page was getting rather cluttered. The RFD pages themselves have been kept for history purposes. 14:27, 3 April 2009 (UTC)

Okay, so the discussion has been open for about a week now, and I think we can summarise the consensus from the voting and discussion above as follows:
So, to that end, I guess we need a new, more precisely defined proposal on deletion of user categories. () 19:14, 4 April 2009 (UTC)

Hello everyone. I think most people agree with me, we need to start improving articles rather than creating millions (well, not that many but anyway) of stubs. This is why I'm proposing we revive . Instead of creating the "articles every wiki should have" we would select certain articles, and by groups of 2 or 3 users, (or more) we could improve 2 or 3 (depending on the number of users) articles per week. Thanks, and happy editing 17:01, 6 April 2009 (UTC)
PLEASE READ THIS FIRST PARAGRAPH THOROUGHLY!

Last time this subject was brought up by myself, I feel there was unnecessary drama. Let us please try to have a civilized discussion now that I'm bringing it up again. Please note that it is not necessary to add your two cents, nor is it necessary to sit out of the discussion entirely. Please be kind, be civil, and let us try to be nicer to each other this time around.

That being said, I still have my heart set on the icons I proposed last time. Razorflame is a vocal opponent of the icons. I understand that completely. I would like to know what other people think of them. I've heard a lot of support on my talk page and in other media of personal communication, but I haven't heard that very much here. Below are the icons proposed:

Cheers, 23:15, 6 April 2009 (UTC)


I can see the professional arguments and the color blind arguments as well so I'll propose these:

Remember "professional" doesn't have to mean "boring" as well.--     23:50, 6 April 2009 (UTC)

Obento Musubi, I'd really like for you to focus on things "other" than icons. People have already vetoed those suggestions. 00:57, 7 April 2009 (UTC)

Comparing to and to , there isn't the same level of visual distinction as far as "instant distinction" goes. Compare to ; you can instantly tell what the difference is, because the latter is "broken", which instantly suggests that the pieces can be put together to make it a whole piece again. // // 04:10, 7 April 2009 (UTC)

And you wonder why people aren't commenting in all your discussions...its probably cause they are sick of saying oppose every time you bring it up again. Leave the icons alone. - () 12:33, 7 April 2009 (UTC)



Alright. Fine. I have been nothing but nice to you guys, and I feel you're just slamming me. This discussion is over. Someone advised me to try again in a few weeks, and I have, and it seems like people here won't change. Whatever. This discussion is over. 17:10, 7 April 2009 (UTC)

Hello all,

I can see a number of articles that would probably be good candidates for GA or VGA (PGA/PVGA), but that currently need massive amounts of work, to even be listable in those categories. I also feel that currently only one or two (in short, very few) people work on improving the articles listed. Yet the which was created for that purpose is virtually dead.

For this reason, I wonder:
These are of course just thoughts I hav,e comments welcome. -- () 14:32, 7 April 2009 (UTC)

Hello I was just thinking about this. I'm new and havn't really found my way around yet. I think that the "edit this page" page would be good. I want to help, but I can't really find bad articles to fix. Could someone explain or give a link to that GA/PV something thing.

I think some (where there is enough interest and support) and a few Portals would be helpful. These are tools other wikipedias use to make coordinated improvements to groups of articles. They bring some consistency and a framework to help both editors and readers. I would like to see subst:templates to support just one basic Portal format, so each Project can add their own titles and their own selected articles and selected pictures to create their own Portal. I wish I knew how to write the needed templates, but maybe somebody else around here knows. What I see is a limited number of WikiProjects (maybe Math, Language, Geography, Science, History, Art, Music, Games, and Anti-Vandalism), each with their own version of the Portal page. That way editors interested in these subjects can help each other. () 12:34, 9 April 2009 (UTC)

The for adminship is a very successful guideline we have. It tells people what we expect from admins, and how to make new ones. Despite this, I think some clarifications are needed:
Can we change the wording of the guideline, so these two items become clearer, do we need to adapt anything else? -- () 22:36, 10 April 2009 (UTC)
Some people don't seem to understand the system of consensus. If, for example, a Request for Deletion had two very well-argued keeps and four "Don't like it" deletes, it should be kept. The same goes for RFA, with different arguments, etc () 12:17, 11 April 2009 (UTC)

What I am proposing is that we use the idea shown in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Spotlight on this wikipedia. We can either use that IRC network, or we can use a different one. In brief summary, Spotlight is a group of editors in one room in an IRC chat focused on improving one specific article by discussing it in real-time. I feel that, with enough members or effort, this is a great way to churn out quality articles. I know on regular English Wikipedia, this has made two good articles (were the standards seem to be much higher) and significantly improved many more. Note: This project will not necessarily create new articles, but we can if needed.
Comments?    11:54, 11 April 2009 (UTC)

Hello all. Please spare a few moments examining Joss Whedon against comments I've made proposing the article's from Good Article status. And if you have any spare time, head to and where we have a few articles to be assessed and/or voted upon. Cheers! () 19:01, 12 April 2009 (UTC)

Hello there,

I am writing this to state once more:

In very short: Getting an article to (Very) good article is a community pastime, and should not be done by only a few editors.

You are therefore invited to help

Thanks. -- () 17:35, 13 April 2009 (UTC)

Can we continue the discussion about correct GFDL attribution please? I noticed a new template, namely , has been created and is in use at ASDA. If we agree this is the correct level of attribution (i.e. no version, just a pointer to en.wiki's article and the article's history) then it strikes me that this template will need to be added to perhaps 80% of our articles. In which case would it be better to request a modification to the mediawiki software to add a caveat to the bottom of all articles which states (something like) "This article is based in part or in total on English Wikipedia's article ..." linking to both the article in question and the history? However, since we have interwiki links, I'm not sure of the use of justing linking to the current version of the article...

We have not adequately resolved this issue. It is important. () 07:15, 9 April 2009 (UTC)

While I think it's a bit ironic that we're voting on this, I think it's important that everyone do so. The WMF Board of Trustees wants to know our opinion on whether to transfer to a CC-BY-SA licence instead of (or in addition to) the current GFDL licence. This would make it much easier to base our content on that of the English Wikipedia. To get to the vote, click here: and follow the link (it must be accessed via a language on which you are sufficiently active... such as Autoconfirmed). Please, take a moment to read the proposal and let WMF know if you support, oppose, or have no opinion. Thanks! 13:24, 14 April 2009 (UTC)

Hello all,

many of our disease-related articles are too unspecific. Some are non-helpful as they give a wrong impression of what a disease or condition really is. I therefore think we should make an effort, to get the descriptions right. IMO it is better to have no article on a disease/condition, to having one that gives a wrong impression.

Some of the articles that need looking at include:
I know that all of these are related to either mental illnesses, or damage of the brain or nervous system. So far I have not had time to look through all disease-related articles. We probably have too few people who are capable of helping here, but could this be a way to attract new editors (by posting on respective wikiproject pages on en and other wikipedias)? -- () 12:57, 15 April 2009 (UTC)

Hi. Since Im new here on simple wikipedia, I just thought I should check with the community whether it is ok for me to create a WikiProject Transport here. I have read and I will follow the guidelines on there. Thanks. () 15:53, 15 April 2009 (UTC)

I'd like to bring up the subject of . I've been observing seWP lately (rather than editing) and I've noticed a distinct lack of civility. I'd like to bring up the subject of CM16 as an "example" of this issue (not the only example to be sure!). "We" often quote CM16 (Aaron) as an example of a person who was banned at another WMF project that has made good contributions to seWP (and so is an example to be praised); yet, I've also noticed a lack of in our dealings with Aaron (CM16). "We" often talk about CM16 in disparaging ways, we complain about his attitudes towards topics he feels are not within the scope of seWP. We talk about his opinions in !votes about various issues on seWP. We also talk about him in ways that seem to believe he should be banned from all WMF projects, not just enWP. Frankly, I find these to be RUDE! I think that the community understands that I am a firm admin, one who believes that examples should be made; one that has a similar viewpoint to that of Majorly's. But, I also think that we are not as forgiving as we should be with regards to people who "have" actually made a good transition from being a banned user elsewhere to a useful user here. It is true that some people might not believe that CM16 is a useful editor here. I'd like to propose that editors here judge such people on their actions here; rather than their history elsewhere (unless evidence requires otherwise!!) I'd also like to propose that we engender a spirit of community here and that this would include forgiving those that have made mistakes in the past; haven't we all, but who have made up for them here! This post is not just about CM16 (and the like) but about all of our interactions with each other (we are often rude with each other). We are a small community; surely we can be nice to each other also!? 02:32, 14 April 2009 (UTC)
There's a difference between violating WP:FORGIVE (which those three users do in my opinion) and pointing out that they did which me and fr33kman have.--     20:41, 14 April 2009 (UTC)
True, but you'd think people would start being forgiving cause I haven't done anything like what I was banned for since March of 2008. But instead I get things like this from Majorly and this from Soup Dish.--     23:20, 14 April 2009 (UTC)

Right, before this thread deteriorates into further incivility and possibly upsets folks further, I'm calling time on it. The key feature of this discussion is that we should all love each other as much as we can. We're all human, we all make mistakes and in general this includes upsetting other people as a result. This Wikipedia thrives by being a more friendly environment, conducive to encouragement and promotion of bold editing. It should continue this way. As they say in many places, Peace. Out.

Leo Borchard

Leo Borchard (born Moscow, 31 March 1899; died 23 August 1945) was a Russian conductor who became a naturalized German.

Borchard was born in Moscow. His parents were German. He spent his childhood in Saint Petersburg where he had music lessons. In 1920, after the Russian Revolution, he emigrated to Germany. Otto Klemperer made him his assistant at the Kroll Opera in Berlin.

He conducted the Berlin Philharmonic for the first time in January 1933. In 1935, he was banned by the Nazis for political reasons. He was not allowed to conduct, so he had to earn some money by teaching.

During World War II he was an activist who was working against the Nazis. After the war had ended he conducted the world famous Berlin Philharmonic in a concert which was very successful. One week later he was given the job of conductor of the orchestra instead of Wilhelm Furtwängler who was in exile in Switzerland. The part of Germany he was in was run by the Russians at this time. Because he had been anti-Nazi, and because he spoke Russian, he was favoured by the political leaders. In less than four months he gave 22 concerts with the BPO. Then, one day, as he was being driven home after a concert, he was shot dead by accident by an American officer.

Felix Weingartner

Felix von Weingartner (born 2 June 1863; died Winterthur, 7 May 1942) was an Austrian conductor, composer and pianist. He is remembered today mainly as a conductor, but he also composed many works.

Weingartner was born in Zara, Dalmatia, which today is called Zadar in Croatia. His parents were Austrian. They were from a noble family. Felix had the title Edler von Münzberg. The family moved to Graz in 1868. His father died that same year. In 1881 he went to Leipzig to study philosophy, but soon spent all his time on music. He started his studies at the Conservatory in 1883. At the same time he studied with the great composer and pianist Franz Liszt in Weimar. Liszt helped him to get his first opera performed. In the same year, 1884, he became the director of the Königsberg Opera. He got conducting jobs in Danzig, then in Hamburg and in Mannheim. From 1891 he was Kapellmeister of the Royal Opera and conductor of symphony concerts in Berlin. Then he gave up that job and went to live in Munich.

In 1902, at the Festival of Mainz, Weingartner conducted all the symphonies of Beethoven. He was becoming famous in Europe as well as in the USA and in South America. From 1908 to 1911 he was the main conductor of the Vienna Hofoper, following on from Gustav Mahler. He kept the job of conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic until 1927. From 1912 he was again Kapellmeister in Hamburg, but in 1914 he went to Darmstadt. In 1919-20 he was conductor of the Vienna Volksoper. In 1920 he was Professor of the Franz Liszt Academy in Budapest. From 1927 to 1934 he was conductor of the Sinfonieorchester Basel. He gave his last concert in London in 1940 and died in Winterthur, Switzerland two years later.

Weingartner was married five times.

Weingartner thought of himself as a composer just as much as a conductor. However, it is as a conductor that he is remembered today. His compositions are hardly ever played now. He composed in a late-Romantic style, and he was an influence on the composer Erich Korngold. He is best remembered today as one of the great conductors of classical music, who conducted in a precise way without exaggerated effects. He wrote books about music including one about conducting.

1978 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1978 Atlantic hurricane season began on June 1, 1978 and ended on November 30, 1978. Sometimes storms can form before June 1 or after November 30. This season is a very good example of that happening. In this season a Subtropical Storm formed in the month of January, long before June 1. This season was about average in storm activity. 1978 would be the last year that the naming list contained only female names because the addition of male names the following year.

Subtropical Storm One gave the 1978 a very early start to its hurricane season when it became the only Atlantic cyclone to form in the month of January, it formed on January 18. It dissipated on the 23rd causing no damage to land and only threatening land briefly. There were two storm in the month of January but they formed in December, they were: Hurricane Alice in 1954 and Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005. Since 1978 there has never another Tropical or Subtropical cyclone to form in the month of January. 

Tropical Storm Amelia formed on July 30 just offshore Brownsville, Texas. Amelia made landfall in Texas and quickly dissipated. But while Amelia was moving trough Texas it caused about 30 deaths and up to 40 inches of rain.

Joseph Schumpeter

Joseph Alois Schumpeter (February 8, 1883 – January 8, 1950) was a researcher in economics and political science. He studied the theory of Marxism and capitalism. In his view, capitalism cannot work because of what he called creative destruction. This term was originally used by Karl Marx to describe the capitalist system, but Schumpeter used it differently: He says that each time innovation occurs, it must (also) change what already exists. In this context, certain structures that already exist will also be destroyed. A current example of this is that digital photography has made the instant camera, such as Polaroid almost disappear.

Vexillology

Vexillology is the study of flags. The word comes from both the Latin word "vexilla" "little sail" for flag plus the Greek suffix"-ology" that means "study of". The "vexillum" was a particular kind of flag used by the Roman legions. Vexillology is a kind of study of symbols related to heraldry. A person who studies flags is a "vexillologist", and a person who designs flags is a "vexillographer".

Because they are flown outside, where they move with the wind, flags are usually designed with bold images and bright, basic colors. Flag design also follows a historical process, where later flag designs are based on earlier flag designs. This means that many flags in an area may look similar because they are all based on one historical flag. Examples include the Pan-African colors, Pan-Arab colors, and the Nordic Cross.
<br clear="all">

The "Flag Identification System" was created by Whitney Smith and adopted by Fédération internationale des associations vexillologiques (FIAV).

The first row is for use on land and the second row is for use on water, each divided into private (civil), government (state), and military (war) use.

There are 63 symbols that can describe the flag, including:

Other symbols are used to describe other uses of the flag, such as official status and which side of the flag is shown. The symbols in common use are:

Superparamagnetism is a form of magnetism. A superparamagnetic material has many small clusters of magnetic things in its structure, but they are not all pointed the same way, so the material is not magnetic by itself. If a magnetic field is applied to the material, then the clusters change direction to match the magnetic field and the material becomes magnetic. Superparamagnetism is like paramagnetism, except it can happen at near room temperature. It happens when materials are made up of very small parts (1-10 nm).

Heidi

Heidi is a book written by Johanna Spyri, published between 1880 and 1881. It is about a young orphan girl who grows up in the Swiss Alps (mountains in Switzerland) with her grandfather.

When her guardians die, Heidi must live in the mountains with her grandfather, Alm-Uncle, who does not like people. He slowly changes and becomes more caring because of Heidi. Then, Heidi must move to Frankfurt, Germany to be the friend of Clara, a girl who is sick and cannot walk. Clara’s grandmother encourages Heidi to learn to read, and she also learns about God. She becomes very homesick, and a kind doctor says that she must return home to her grandfather. Later, Clara visits Heidi in the Alps and becomes strong enough to walk.

Johanna Spryi wrote this story for her son, Berhard Diethelm Spryi. People and places in the story come from Spryi's own life. Catherine Eayrs, a literary critic, thinks that the village of Dorfli, which is not named, may come from Jenins in Switzerland, a place that Spryi visited as a child. (In the book, only the nearby railway station of "Mayenfeld" is named.) Also, the kindly doctor is similar to Spryi's own father, and Klara's grandmother is a good storyteller, just like Spryi's own mother.

Immediately after the book was published, "Heidi" was popular, both with children and adults. It continues to be popular, and translations are available in more than fifty languages. About 50 million books have been sold. The story has also been told on movie and television. There is even a musical version.

Visitor’s to Switzerland can visit a tourist village called Heididorf, Heidi’s village in Maienfeld.

Some readers think that one problem of "Heidi" is that the book teaches the Christian religion. Malcolm Usrey, a literary critic, thinks that nature is as important as Christianity in helping people, because Klara’s paralysis and Heidi’s home sickness are both healed in the “clean air of the Swiss mountains”.

<doc id="178025" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178025" title="Hans von Bülow">
Hans von Bülow

Hans von Bülow (born Dresden, 8 January 1830 ; died Cairo, 12 February 1894) was a German conductor and pianist. He was one of the most famous conductors of the 19th century as well as being a famous pianist. He is especially remembered for his conducting of the operas of Richard Wagner.

Bülow was born in Dresden. His family belonged to the nobility: he had the title of “Freiherr” (similar to the English Baron). When he was nine he had music lessons from Friedrich Wieck who was the father of Clara Schumann. However, his parents said that he had to study law instead of music, and they sent him to Leipzig. 

During this time he met Franz Liszt in Weimar and he heard him conduct the music of Wagner. He decided to study music even though his parents did not want him to. He went to Zürich where Wagner was living in exile. Wagner thought he was very talented and got him some conducting jobs. In 1851 he went to Weimar to study the piano with Liszt. He worked very hard at his piano technique. He also wrote articles about music. Liszt also thought that von Bülow would become a great musician.

In 1853 Bülow made his first concert tour. He played in Vienna, Pest, Dresden, Karlsruhe, Bremen, Hamburg and Berlin. He taught the piano in Berlin and gave a lot of support to young composers who had new ideas about music. He toured as pianist and conductor in Germany and Russia. In 1857 he married Liszt’s daughter, Cosima. They had two daughters.

In 1864 he became the Hofkapellmeister in Munich. This was a very important conducting job and it made him extremely famous. He conducted the first performances of two Wagner operas: "Tristan und Isolde" (1865) and "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg" (1868). These were extremely successful. Meanwhile Cosima was having a love affair with Richard Wagner. In 1868 she left her husband to live with Wagner, taking their daughters with her. She divorced Bülow, who went to Florence for a while to recover from the shock. However, he always continued to show great respect for Wagner and continued to conduct his music. When Wagner died in 1883 he was terribly sad. 

In 1872 Bülow toured again. He visited England and the USA where, as the solo pianist, he gave the first performance (world premiere) of Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1 in Boston in 1875. 

From 1878 to 1880 he was conductor in Hanover, but had to leave after a quarrel with a tenor. In 1880 he went to Meiningen where he conducted the orchestra, making it one of the best orchestras in Germany. He made the players perform from memory. He often conducted the music of Johannes Brahms. He thought about every detail of the pieces he conducted. He liked to have two pianos on the stage so that he could face the audience or have his back to them, whichever he wanted.
During this time he met Richard Strauss in Berlin. He helped Strauss, who was a young man at the time, to make his music well known

He did new things with his orchestra, such as introducing a double bass with five strings (this is now normal in most European orchestras). He also introduced timpani with pedals. In the late 1880s he settled in Hamburg, but continued to tour, both conducting and performing on the piano. 

Bülow had health problems which gave him very bad headaches. He went to warmer countries to try to get better. He died in a hotel in Cairo, Egypt, ten months after his last concert performance.

Bülow was not only a conductor and pianist, but also a composer. His piano compositions are influenced by Liszt. They are very difficult to play. He was also very good at writing about music. He always wrote what he thought, even if it offended some people.

Sergiu Celibidache

Sergiu Celibidache (pronounce: SER-zhoo Chay-lee-bee-DAH-ke), (born Roman, Romania, 28 June 1912; died 14 August 1996) was a Romanian conductor. He was one of the great conductors of his time, living in Germany all his adult life.

Celibidache was born in Romania. He went to Berlin in 1936 and in 1939 studied there at the Hochschule für Musik. He got a doctorate by writing about the Renaissance composer Josquin Desprez. He was lucky very early in his career to be appointed as conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. He stayed with them until 1952 when Wilhelm Furtwängler returned. He later worked with radio orchestras in Stockholm, Stuttgart and Paris. He also worked for a time in Britain, as well as touring in Europe and South America. From 1979 until his death he was music director of the Munich Philharmonic. He taught at Mainz University in Germany and in 1984 taught at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He liked teaching and often let students come to his lessons without having to pay.

Celibidache did not like making recordings, although there are a few recordings of his concerts which have survived. He was well known for asking for lots of rehearsals, and he rehearsed his orchestras in great detail. He often chose very slow speeds for the slow movements and very fast speeds for the fast movements. 
In Munich he had a long argument with the trombone player Abbie Conant because he did not want her in the orchestra. Conant thought it was because she was a woman that he did not want her. The argument lasted for 12 years.

Celibidache died near Paris in 1996 at 84.

Claudio Abbado (born Milan, 26 June 1933), is an Italian conductor. He has conducted many of the world’s greatest orchestras..

Abbado was born in Milan, Italy. His father played the violin and composed. He started to learn the piano from his father. He studied music at the Milan Conservatory and often had the opportunity to listen to famous conductors rehearsing, e.g. Arturo Toscanini, Bruno Walter and Wilhelm Furtwängler. He did not like the way that Toscanini shouted and yelled at the orchestra. He knew that he did not want to be like him. He studied conducting at the Vienna Academy of Music. In 1958, he won the international Koussevitsky competition for conductors. Soon he was invited to conduct in many parts of Italy. In 1963 he won the Dmitri Mitropoulos Competition for conductors. This allowed him to work for five months with the New York Philharmonic. 

He first conducted at La Scala in Milan in 1960. He was music director there from 1968 to 1986. He conducted the Vienna Philharmonic for the first time in 1965 in a concert at the Salzburg Festival. He was music director for the Vienna State Opera from 1986 to 1991, where he conducted traditional operas as well as new, 20th-century operas.

He was principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra from 1979 to 1987. In the US, he was principal guest conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra from 1982 to 1986. With both orchestras, Abbado made a number of recordings for Deutsche Grammophon.

In 1989, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra chose Abbado to be their conductor, to succeed Herbert von Karajan. Abbado stayed with them until 2002 when he left because of his bad health, although he returned in 2004 to make several recordings with them.

Abbado has conducted a lot of Romantic music, especially the symphonies of Gustav Mahler. He has conducted many modern works such as Arnold Schoenberg, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Giacomo Manzoni, Luigi Nono, Bruno Maderna, Thomas Adler, Giovanni Sollima, Roberto Carnevale, Franco Donatoni and George Benjamin.

In 1988, he started the music festival Wien Modern (Vienna Modern). This festival is now not just for modern music but other forms of modern art as well.

Abbado is also well known for his work with young musicians. He started the European Union Youth Orchestra in 1978 and the Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester (Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra) in 1986. He often conducted the Chamber Orchestra of Europe and has recently worked with the Orquesta Sinfónica Simón Bolívar of Venezuela.
Abbado was found to have stomach cancer in 2000 and he had a major operation.
After he got better he started the Lucerne Festival Orchestra in 2003. He is also music director of the Mozart Orchestra of Bologna, Italy.

Abbado's son Daniele is an opera-director. From his relationship with the violinist Viktoria Mullova, he is the father of her oldest child, Misha. His nephew Roberto Abbado is also a conductor.

Vernier scale

A Vernier scale is a way to get a much better result when measuring how long something is or the size of an angle.
Sometimes when measuring things we need to get our measurement as accurate as possible. Accuracy is important in surveying the land, navigation of ships , making parts for machines like car engines, looking at stars and planets in astronomy and when doing experiments in science. 

Length has been measured with a straight ruler for hundreds of years. If the object we are measuring is somewhere in between two of the marks on our ruler then we would have to estimate where between the two marks to take the measurement. A Vernier scale on our ruler does this last fine piece of measuring between the two marks for us. So , for example if the measurement with our eye said it was between 1.5 and 1.6 centimeters, we would look at the Vernier and we would be able to say the measure is actually 1.57, something it would be very hard to see with the eye alone.

When measuring angles the same problem occurs and a vernier may be part of a device to measure fine angles in between two of the marks on the scale.

We don't need to be sharp eyed to read the Vernier scale because its marks are almost as big as our main measuring scale. We just count how many marks there are to the next place where there is a mark on both the main and vernier scales that are exactly lined up. That number of marks tells us the size of the small extra measurement.

Simon Rattle

Sir Simon Denis Rattle CBE, (born Liverpool, 19 January 1955) is an English conductor. He became internationally famous as the conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra which he made into a world-class orchestra. Since 1999 he has been the conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic.

Rattle was born in Liverpool and studied at Liverpool College. He learned to play the piano and the violin. He started to play in orchestras, but as a percussionist. He went to study at the Royal Academy of Music in London in 1971. Three years later he won the John Player Conductor Competition. He organised and conducted a performance of Mahler's Second Symphony whilst still at the Academy. He spent a year studying English Language and literature at St Anne's College, Oxford.

In 1974, he was made assistant conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, and in 1977 assistant conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic.

He spent 18 years as conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO), from 1980 to 1998. During this time he made the orchestra into one of the best European orchestras. The orchestra used to give their concerts at the Town Hall in Birmingham, but a new concert hall, the Symphony Hall, was opened in 1991. The BBC made a film about Rattle and the CBSO during his last year with the orchestra. It was called: "Simon Rattle — Moving On".

Rattle was given the award of CBE in 1987 and made a Knight Bachelor in 1994. In 1992, Rattle was made Principal Guest Conductor of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (OAE), together with Frans Brüggen. Rattle now has the title of Principal Artist with the OAE. In 2001, Rattle conducted the OAE at Glyndebourne in their first production of Beethoven’s opera "Fidelio" with a period-instrument orchestra.

In May 2006 he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Society of Arts.

The first time Rattle conducted the Berlin Philharmonic (BPO) was in 1987 when he gave a performance of Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 6. In 1999 Rattle was made chief conductor of the orchestra when Claudio Abbado left. Before he agreed to take the job he insisted on making some changes to make sure that all the orchestral members were paid fairly and that the orchestra could make its own decisions instead of having to do what the Berlin Senate told them.

Before he left England he said some very critical things about the British attitude to culture, especially to music. He thought that not enough money was being spent on the arts and that the politicians were not interested in music.

He gave his first concert as principal conductor of the BPO on 7 September 2002, leading performances of Thomas Adès' "Asyla" and Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 5. He has done many new things since working in Berlin. He has continued to conduct the music of many living British composers. He has formed an educational programme so that young people in Berlin get used to hearing classical music. Some people have criticised what Rattle has done in Berlin, but many people support him.

Rattle was originally going to stay with the BPO until 2012, but in April 2008 the players decided they want him to stay until 2020

Rattle has toured to many countries during his career. He has conducted in North America. In 1979 he conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic (LAP) and was their Principal Guest Conductor from 1981–1994. He also guest-conducted the Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and Boston Symphony Orchestra.

In 1993, Rattle conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra. They wanted him to be their chief conductor, but Rattle could not take on the job. Instead, he often performs as their guest conductor. 

Rattle has conducted lots of different music, sometimes old music with period instruments, sometimes music by living composers. He is very well known for his performances of Mahler. He has won many awards for his recordings.

Rattle has been married three times. He is a fan of Liverpool F.C.

Adhan

The adhān (also Athaan: IPA: [ʔæˈðæːn]) (أَذَان) is the Islamic call to prayer. The muezzin reads it out aloud. The root of the word is ' "to permit", and another derivative of this word is ', meaning "ear."

The muezzin reads Adhan in the mosque, sometimes from a minaret. He usually does this five times a day. Adhan is used to call other Muslims to do the prayers. There is a second call, known as iqama (set up) that is used to tell Muslims to line up for the start of the prayers. Sometimes, loudspeakers are used on the minarets. 

Sunni and Shi'a use versions of adhan which are slightly different from each other.

Ken Whisenhunt

Kenneth "Ken" Moore Whisenhunt (born February 28, 1962 in Augusta, Georgia) is the American football head coach of the Arizona Cardinals NFL football team, leading them to the first Super Bowl in ream history during the 2008 season. Before that, he was known for his well-planned offensive plays, including the success he had with the Pittsburgh Steelers in his 3 years as their offensive coordinator under Bill Cowher, in which the Steeers won Super Bowl XL during the 2005 season. 

After attending the Academy of Richmond County in Augusta, Georgia for high school, Whisenhunt played college football at Georgia Tech (1980-84), where he graduated with a degree in Civil Engineering. During his senior season, he was an honorable mention All-American. He also finished first team all-ACC during his final two college seasons. 

Whisenhunt's career as a player included 4 years (1985-88) as a tight end with the Atlanta Falcons, who drafted him in the twelfth round, and then short periods with the Washington Redskins and New York Jets. He retired from the league in 1993 after nine seasons in which he was mostly known as a blocker.

He began his coaching career at Vanderbilt University, where he coached special teams, tight ends and H-backs for the Commodores from 1995–96. In 1997, he returned to the NFL as the tight ends coach for the Baltimore Ravens. Whisenhunt changed teams very often in his early years in the league, moving to the staff of the Cleveland Browns in 1999 and to the New York Jets the following season.

In 2001, Whisenhunt was hired by the Steelers to coach their tight ends. He was able to make players such as Mark Bruener and Jay Riemersma, both considered no longer at their best, into great blocking backs. He became offensive coordinator in Pittsburgh for the 2004 season after Mike Mularkey became the head coach of the Buffalo Bills. Whisenhunt had instant success in his role. While Mularkey was known for creating exciting trick plays, Whisenhunt became more of a cautious play-caller, whose well-timed trick plays surprised the Steelers' opponents because they were very unlike the conservative Pittsburgh run game. 

Whisenhunt's most famous moment is the trick play he called in Super Bowl XL. With Pittsburgh leading 14-10 over the Seattle Seahawks, Whisenhunt called a wide receiver reverse pass (Antwaan Randle El to Hines Ward, the only TD pass thrown by a WR in Super Bowl history) that allowed Pittsburgh to get a big lead, which they did not give away. 

On January 14, 2007 the Arizona Cardinals hired Whisenhunt as their new head coach. The contract he received promised him an average of $2.5 million annually. Whisenhunt had also interviewed for the head coaching position with the Steelers, Atlanta Falcons and Miami Dolphins. In February 2006, the Oakland Raiders were interviewing him to become their new head coach, but Whisenhunt ended the talks before a deal could be offered. The Cardinals were better in Whisenhunt's first season, finishing with 8 wins and 8 losses after finishing with 5 wins and 11 losses the two seasons before that and losing 10 or more games in seven of the previous eight campaigns. It was their first non-losing season since 1998, even though they still failed to make the playoffs. 

Before his second season, Whisenhunt made the experienced Kurt Warner his starting quarterback. In Whisenhunt's first season, Warner had split time with the team's younger quarterback Matt Leinart, although Warner started the final 11 games of the 2007 season after Leinart suffered a season-ending injury. This was a good decision because Warner put up good numbers in leading the Cardinals to a 9 win and 7 loss regular season record in the 2008 season. This was good enough to win NFC West Division, the Cardinals' first division title since 1975, when the team played in St. Louis, Missouri. Whisenhunt's second season was also the Cardinals' first time in the playoffs since 1998. After beating the Atlanta Falcons and the Carolina Panthers in the first two rounds of the NFC playoffs, the Cardinals defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship on January 18, 2009 and advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time in franchise history to face the Pittsburgh Steelers. This gave Whisenhunt an opportunity to play against the team he used to be the offensive coordinator of. The Cardinals lost the game 27-23. Whisenhunt credited the Steelers' players and staff with the win, but also said penalties were one of the reasons for the loss.

Whisenhunt has worked on the staff of four National Football League coaches. They are: 

Whisenhunt has had one future National Football League coach work under him. He was:

Ken and his wife, Alice, have two children: a son Kenneth Jr., and daughter Mary Ashley.

El Seibo Province

El Seibo is a Dominican province, located in the eastern part of the country. Its capital city is Santa Cruz del Seibo.

It was one of the first provinces in the country; the first Dominican constitution made it in 1844 one of the five original provinces of the country. Its name has always been El Seibo, written sometimes as "El Seybo".

The El Seibo province has the La Altagracia province to the east, the San Pedro de Macorís province to the south and the Hato Mayor province to the west. To the north of the El Seibo province is the Samaná Bay, part of the Atlantic Ocean.

The province takes the name from its main city: El Seibo.

On 24 July 1844, after the Dominican independence, the government made five departments (another name for province); one of those departments was the El Seibo Department, with the municipalities of El Seibo, Hato Mayor, Higüey and Samaná. The first Dominican constitution kept that division but as provinces instead of departments.

The original province had all the eastern part of the Hispaniola, including the Samaná peninsula. But soon the province was reduced to make new provinces. The first two new provinces made with land of El Seibo province were Samaná in 1865, and San Pedro de Macorís in 1882.

In 1961, the old La Altagracia province, that later was divided in La Altagracia and La Romana provinces, was made out of the El Seibo province. The last province made with part of El Seibo was Hato Mayor in 1984.

People from this province took part in the war against Haiti during the Independence War; the leader was Pedro Santana, who had a farm near to the city of El Seibo and who became the first president of the country.

Before that, people from El Seibo fought against the French army. The most important battle was the "Palo Hincado Battle" won by the Dominican people on 7 November 1808, in a savanna ("Palo Hincado Savanna") just to the east of Santa Cruz del Seibo. Soon the French had to leave the country, and the whole island; they had lost Haiti, too.

In 2002 (last national census), there were 89,261 people living in the El Seibo province, and just 33,738 (37.8%) living in towns and cities. The population density was 50 persons/km².

The estimated population in the province for 2007 was of 100,323 inhabitants: 53,384 men and 46,939 women, for a population density of 69.11 persons/km².

El Seibo has a total area of 1,786.80 km². It has 3.7% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 11th (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province of the country.

There are at least three geographic regions in the province. From north to south, they are:

The River Soco is the most important river of the province; it flows from the Cordillera Oriental to the Caribbean Sea.

The only main road in the province is the "Carretera Mella" (Mella National Road) that goes through the middle of the province; the road comes from Santo Domingo and goes through the cities of Hato Mayor and Santa Cruz del Seibo and ends in Higüey.

There are two municipalities and five municipal districts in the province. The municipal districts are similar to municipalities but they depend on a municipality.

The municipalities and municipal districts (M.D.) are:

Cattle raising is the most important activity in the province. Sugar cane and cacao are the mos important crops.

Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra

The Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (in Dutch: "Koninklijk Concertgebouworkest") is an orchestra in the Netherlands. The orchestra is based in Amsterdam. “Concertgebouw” (pronounced: “Con-SERT-ghe-bouw”) is the Dutch word for “concert hall”. For nearly a century the orchestra were just called “Concertgebouw Orchestra”, but in 1988 the Queen Beatrix gave them the "Royal" title.

The concert hall, called the Concertgebouw, was opened on 11 April 1888. The orchestra was formed later that year and gave its first performance on 3 November 1888 under Willem Kes, who was to be their conductor for seven years.

In 1895, Willem Mengelberg became chief conductor. He was to be their conductor for fifty years. He made them into a world-class orchestra. He is particularly remembered for his conducting of the music of Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss whose music was new in those days.

As well as their chief conductor, the orchestra had assistant conductor positions called “first conductor” and “second conductor”. During Mengelberg’s time the “first conductors” included Karl Muck (1921-1925), Pierre Monteux (1924-1934), Bruno Walter (1934-1939), and Eugen Jochum (1941-1943), and the second conductors included the composer Cornelis Dopper, Evert Cornelis and Eduard van Beinum.

In 1945, after World War II had ended, Mengelberg was not allowed to conduct the orchestra because he had played to the Nazis. He was banned for six years from conducting them, but he died in 1951 just before the six years came to an end.

From 1945 to 1959, the orchestra's main conductor was Eduard van Beinum, who had sometimes conducted the orchestra since 1929. He was especially fond of the symphonies of Anton Bruckner, and he made recordings of Bruckner's Eighth and Ninth Symphonies for the Philips Records. Van Beinum conducted the orchestra until April 1959 when he suddenly had a heart attack and died during a rehearsal.
Bernard Haitink first conducted the Concertgebouw Orchestra on 7 November 1956. After van Beinum's death, Haitink became the orchestra's first conductor in September 1959. From 1961 to 1963, Haitink and Eugen Jochum shared the post of chief conductor of the orchestra. Haitink became the only chief conductor in 1963, and continued in this post until 1988. He had “assistant conductors”, including Edo de Waart and Hans Vonk. 

Haitink made many recordings with the orchestra. In the early 1980s, the Dutch government was going to reduce the amount of money that the orchestra would get. This would mean that 23 musicians would have to lose their job. Haitink said he would resign if they did that. Fortunately the government changed their mind.

Riccardo Chailly became chief conductor of the orchestra in 1985. He recorded many symphonies with them including symphonies by Mahler, Bruckner and Shostakovich. When he left in 2004 Mariss Jansons became chief conductor.

In the December 2008 issue of Gramophone Magazine the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra was ranked as the best symphony orchestra in the world.

GNU GRUB

GNU GRUB ("GRUB" for short) is a boot loader package from the GNU Project. GRUB is the main example of the Multiboot Specification, which allows a user to have more than one operating systems on their computer at once, and to choose which one to run when the computer starts. GRUB can be used to select from different kernel images available on a particular operating system's partitions, as well as to pass boot-time parameters to such kernels.

When a computer is turned on, the computer's BIOS finds the primary bootable device (usually the computer's hard disk) and loads the initial bootstrap program from the master boot record (MBR), the first 512 bytes of the hard disk, and then transfers control to this code.

The MBR contains GRUB stage 1. Because of the small size of the MBR, Stage 1 just loads the next stage of GRUB (which may reside physically elsewhere on the disk). Stage 1 can either load Stage 2 directly, or it can load stage 1.5: GRUB Stage 1.5 is located in the first 30 kilobytes of hard disk immediately following the MBR. Stage 1.5 loads Stage 2. 

When GRUB Stage 2 receives control, it presents an interface to the user in order to select which operating system to boot. This normally takes the form of a graphical menu, although if this is not available or the user wishes further control, GRUB has its own command prompt, where the user can manually specify the boot parameters. GRUB can also be set to automatically load a particular kernel after a timeout period.

Once boot options have been selected, GRUB loads the selected kernel into memory and passes control on to the kernel, which then continues to start itself. At this stage GRUB can also pass control of the boot process to another loader, using "chain loading", for operating systems such as Windows that do not support the Multiboot standard. In this case, copies of the other system's boot programs have been saved by GRUB; instead of a kernel, the other system is loaded as though it had been started from the MBR. This may be yet another boot manager, such as the Microsoft boot menu, allowing further selection of non-Multiboot operating systems. (This behavior is often automatic when modern Linux distributions are installed "on top of" existing Windows systems, allowing the user to retain the original operating system without changes, including systems that contain multiple versions of Windows.)

Majority rule is a way of making decisions in government or in voting. A decision is made if it gets more than half of the votes. Majority rule is often used in referendums, which is when voters decide if they want to make a law by voting yes or no.

Majority rule is not the same as a plurality vote. A plurality vote, which is usually used in elections, is where whoever gets the most votes wins. With a plurality vote, the winner can have fewer than half of the votes if there are more than two choices.

Some people have criticized majority rule because it can lead to the tyranny of the majority, where people who are the majority might vote for something that helps them but hurts the people in the minority.

The 7 July 2005 London bombings were a series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks. They were aimed at London's public transport system during the morning rush hour. They were carried out by British Muslim extremists.

At 08:50, three bombs exploded within fifty seconds of each other on three London Underground trains. Then a fourth exploded an hour later at 09:47 on a bus in Tavistock Square. The explosions were caused by home-made bombs. The bombs were packed into rucksacks and set off by the bombers themselves.

A memorial was made in Hyde Park, London on the 7 July 2009. This had 52 stainless steel pillars, one for each murder victim. They were arranged in four clusters for the four bomb sites.
52 died and over 700 were injured in the attack.

After this attack there was a huge police reform in the UK which is ongoing. The terror threat is at 'severe' and a large number of police in London are authorised to carry firearms. London is always on high alert for terrorism and pro-actively combats it with the help of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (similar to the American FBI) and MI6.

Prince Josias of Coburg

Prince Frederick Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, Duke in Saxony (December 26, 1737-February 26, 1815), was a famous general of the Habsburg Emperors.

Born at Schloß Ehrenburg in Coburg, he was the youngest son of Duke Francis Josias, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and Anna Sophie, Princess of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt.

Josias joined the Habsburg military as Colonel in 1759. After participating in the Seven Years' War, he rose to the rank of Lieutenant Field Marshal by 1773. In the Russo-Turkish-Austrian war of 1788, he commanded an army under Freiherr von Laudon, occupying Moldavia, capturing Khotyn in Bessarabia and sharing in Aleksandr Suvorov's success in the Battle of Focşani (August 1, 1789). Having completely beaten the main Ottoman army under Grand Vizier Koca Yusuf Pasha in the Battle of Rymnik, he captured the greater part of Wallachia, including Bucharest, being welcomed by the population after the flight of Prince Nicholas Mavrogenes. Soon after that, he became a Field General.

During the occupation of Moldavia, Josias met Therese Stroffeck, a regular person. On September 24, 1789, in the town of Roman, she gave birth to a son. The son's name was Frederick. Josias married Therese after their return to Coburg, on December 24. He then said that he was the father of Frederick. Frederick was by the Austrian Emperor on August 25, 1808. On February 17, 1853 the Duke Ernst II of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha created him "Freiherr von Rohmann", named after the place of his birth. But Frederick, because he was born before his parents were married, did not inherit the duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld.

In 1793 and 1794, Josias commanded the army in the Austrian Netherlands during the Flanders Campaign. Because of his victories in the French Revolutionary Wars (in the Battle of Neerwinden (1793) and the Battle of Aldenhoven (1794)), he returned the region to Austrian control. Entering France, he took Condé, Valenciennes, Quesnoy and Landrecies. However, due to poor positioning he suffered a string of minor setbacks. This poor positioning was caused by amongst the Allied powers and their forces. His army than suffered a defeat at the Battle of Fleurus (26 June). 
After these losses, Josias left the Netherlands. Habsburg diplomats had already decided to give up the region, anyway. Upset by both this and the policies of the Baron Thugut, Josias resigned as Field Marshal. The Count of Clerfayt took over the position. Josias then went to Coburg, where he later died.

Residentie Orchestra

The Residentie Orchestra (Dutch: Residentie Orkest) is an orchestra from The Hague in the Netherlands. Outside the Netherlands it is often known as The Hague Philharmonic. The name “Residentie” (“Residence”) shows that it comes from The Hague, which is where the Dutch parliament meets. The Hague is the “residence of the Queen’s parliament”, although it is not the capital city of the Netherlands. The orchestra are internationally famous.

The orchestra started to form in 1903 when a group of musicians who called themselves the “Residentie Orkest” gave a concert in the Gebouw voor Kunsten en Wetenschappen (Building for Arts and Sciences) in the centre of the Hague. By the end of the following year they had formed to give regular concerts. Their concert on 20 November 1904 is taken to be the official beginning of the orchestra.

The first conductor of the orchestra was Henri Viotta, who soon made it a very good orchestra. Famous composers came to conduct their own works with the orchestra. These included Richard Strauss, Igor Stravinsky, Max Reger and Maurice Ravel. The orchestra was sometimes conducted by the Dutch composer Peter van Anrooy, as well as their guest conductor George Szell.

The orchestra continued to be internationally known, and some very famous conductors came to conduct the orchestra, including Arturo Toscanini, Bruno Walter, Leonard Bernstein and Hans Knappertsbusch.
During the years after World War II, from 1949 to 1973, Willem van Otterloo was the chief conductor. They gave regular concerts in the Hague and in Amsterdam and made recordings for Philips Gramophone. Van Otterloo introduced them to many different styles of music. As in its earlier days, the orchestra often played modern music conducted by the composers: Bruno Maderna, Mauricio Kagel, John Cage and Pierre Boulez conducted their works. Recordings were made with other conductors including Gennady Rozhdestvensky and Evgenii Svetlanov who included music by less well-known Russian composers.

Jaap van Zweden, who conducted the orchestra for the first five years of this century, took them on tour to Japan and South America and they made recordings to celebrate 100 years of the orchestra. Van Zweden is still Honorary Guest Conductor of the orchestra.

Today the orchestra’s chief conductor is Neeme Järvi. Many new things have been started, including some concerts given by the Residentie Scratch Orchestra, in which amateur players can join the professional players of the orchestra to give a concert.

The Residentie Orchestra gave many of their concerts in the Gebouw voor Kunsten en Wetenschappen (more simply known as “K&W Building”), but also the summer concerts in the Kurzaal in Scheveningen, the seaside resort of the Hague, were very famous. Until 1915 these had been given by the Orchestre Lamoureux. The Residentie took them over and continued them until 1968.

The orchestra moved out of the K&W Building in 1964. Shortly afterwards the building was destroyed by fire. The Residentie Orchestra gave their regular concerts in the Kurzaal until 1968 when they moved to the Congresgebouw (Congress Building) in the west of the Hague. This was still not a very good concert hall and in 1987 they were able to move to the new Dr. Anton Philipszaal in the centre of the town. There are plans now to build a completely new arts complex there.

Terracotta Army

The Terracotta Army is the buried army of Qin Shi Huang, an ancient Chinese emperor. These ancient sculptures were built and buried over twenty centuries ago near the city of Xi'an. They were discovered in 1974 by farmers digging a well looking for underground water. Over a thousand terracotta warriors and horses have been uncovered since then. At least 6,000 more are thought to remain buried still.

According to the Chinese historian Sima Qian, Qin Shi Huang ordered this army to be built as soon as he became emperor in 246BC. They were constructed to protect him in the afterlife after his death. He died in 210BC. Over 700,000 workers were needed to build the underground city where he was buried. It is thought to be filled with riches and decorated beautifully. The Chinese government has no plans to uncover the underground palace.

Each terracotta warrior is made of clay. They are around 2 meters tall, with commanders in the army being the tallest. The sculptures are so detailed that it is possible to guess the age, rank and personality of each one. None of the soldiers are the same. Some carry weapons such as daggers, bows and arrows, swords, spears or axes.

Eid al-Adha

Eid al-Adha ( "‘Īdu l-’Aḍḥā") "Festival of Sacrifice" or "Greater Bairam" is a religious festival celebrated by Muslims all over the world. It is when Muslims sacrifice a goat, sheep, cow or a camel, sending to poor people as a donation 
. It marks the end of the Pilgrimage or Hajj for the millions of Muslims who make the trip to Mecca each year and pray many times of the day. They like to tell Allah what they are thinking and hope for him to help them, and remember Ibrahim and Ishmael's courage and devotion to God.

The festival is to celebrate Ibrahim's (Abraham) willingness to sacrifice his son, Ishmael, because Allah told him to do so in a dream. At the final moment, God told him to sacrifice a lamb instead, and this act is of sacrificing a sheep is copied by Muslims all over the world today on Eid.

Ibrahim was tempted by Satan not to listen to God, and Ibrahim drove Satan away by throwing pepples at him. This is also still commemerated by Muslims during Hajj.

Eid prayer must be offered in congregation. It consists of two Raka'ah (units) with seven Takbirs in the first Raka'ah and five Takbirs in the second Raka'ah.

The sacrifice of an animal, usually a lamb or a goat, is a very important part of Eid. The act repeats what Ibrahim did, and also shows Muslims' devotion to God (Allah).

Muslims celebrate by having a feast, and giving gifts to the poor. In some Muslim traditions gifts are also given to children. Also, in Muslim countries the day is given as a national holiday.

Marcelo Hilario del Pilar y Gatmaitan (August 30, 1850 – July 4, 1896), was a Filipino revolutionary leader of the Philippine Revolution and one of the leading Ilustrado (Knowledgeable) propagandist of the Philippine War of Independence.

Marcelo H. del Pilar was born in Cupang (now Barangay San Nicolas, Bulacan, Bulacan, on August 30, 1850, to cultured parents Julián del Pilar and Blasa Gatmaytan. He studied at the Colegio de San José and later at the University of Santo Tomas, where he finished his law course in 1880. In 1882, del Pilar founded the newspaper "Diariong Tagalog" to propagate democratic liberal ideas among the farmers and peasants. In 1888, he defended Jose Rizal's polemical writings by issuing a pamphlet against a priest's attack, exhibiting his deadly wit and savage ridicule of clerical follies. In 1888, fleeing from clerical persecution, del Pilar went to Spain, leaving his family behind. In December 1889, he succeeded Graciano López Jaena as editor of the Filipino reformist periodical "La Solidaridad" in Madrid. He promoted the objectives of the paper by contacting liberal Spaniards who would side with the Filipino cause.

Del Pilar's militant and progressive outlook derived from the classic Enlightenment tradition of the French philosophes and the scientific empiricism of the European bourgeoisie. He died of tuberculosis in abject poverty in Barcelona, Spain, on July 4, 1896 at the age of 46.

However, it is not known where it came from for sure. Chaucer uses the word "sluttish" (late 14c.) to describe a dirty man. However, it is most often used today to describe women, not men. Also, hard pieces in bread because it was not well kneaded were called "slut's pennies".

History of saffron cultivation

The history of saffron growing reaches back more than 3,000 years. The wild plant from which the saffron crocus came was called "Crocus cartwrightianus". Humans began choosing wild plants that had long "stigmas". Gradually, a form of "C. cartwrightianus", "C. sativus", came into being in the late Bronze Age Crete. Experts believe that the first document to mention saffron is a 7th century BC Assyrian book about botany which was written in the time of Ashurbanipal. Since then, we have found evidence for the use of saffron in the treatment of about 90 illnesses during the past 4,000 years. 
The Minoans had pictures of saffron in their palaces as long ago as 1500–1600 BC, showing how it could be used as a medicine. Later, Greek legends told of sea voyages to Cilicia, where adventurers hoped to find the world's most valuable saffron. Another legend tells how someone named Crocus was bewitched and transformed into the original saffron crocus. Ancient Mediterranean peoples—including perfumers in Egypt, physicians in Gaza, townspeople in Rhodes, and the Greek "hetaerae" courtesans—used saffron in their perfumes, ointments, potpourris, mascaras, divine offerings, and medical treatments. 
In late Hellenistic Egypt, Cleopatra used saffron in her baths to make her feel good. Egyptian healers used saffron as a treatment for all varieties of gastrointestinal ailments. Saffron was also used as a fabric dye in such Levant cities as Sidon and Tyre. Aulus Cornelius Celsus prescribes saffron in medicines for wounds, cough, colic, and scabies, and in the mithridatium. Such was the Romans' love of saffron that Roman colonists took their saffron with them when they settled in southern Gaul, where it was extensively cultivated until Rome's fall. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th century AD Moors or with the Avignon papacy in the 14th century AD.

Paints made from saffron were being used for drawing 50,000 years ago. These have been found in the country that is today called Iraq. Later, people called the Sumerians used wild-growing saffron in their remedies and magical potions. Traders carried saffron for long distances before the 2nd millennium BC. Ancient Persians were growing their own type of saffron ("Crocus sativus" 'Hausknechtii') in Derbena, Isfahan, and Khorasan by the 10th century BC. Sometimes saffron threads were woven into textiles. They were given as offerings to the gods and used in dyes, perfumes, medicines, and body washes. Saffron threads were also scattered across beds and mixed into hot tea as a way of curing sad feelings. Other people were afraid that the Persians would use saffron as a drug and aphrodisiac. During his Asian campaigns, Alexander the Great used Persian saffron in his tea, rice, and baths to help heal his battle wounds. Alexander's troops copied their leader's actions and brought the habit of saffron-bathing back to Greece.

No one knows how saffron arrived in South Asia. Traditional Kashmiri and Chinese accounts date its arrival anywhere between 900–2500 years ago. Meanwhile, historians studying ancient Persian records date the arrival to sometime prior to 500 BC, attributing it to either Persian transplantation of saffron corms to stock new gardens and parks or to a Persian invasion and colonization of Kashmir. Phoenicians then marketed Kashmiri saffron as a dye and a treatment for melancholy. From there, saffron use in foods and dyes spread throughout South Asia. For example, Buddhist monks in India adopted saffron-coloured robes after the Buddha Siddhartha Gautama's death. However, the robes were not dyed with costly saffron but turmeric, a less expensive dye, or jackfruit. 

Some historians believe that saffron first came to China with Mongol invaders by way of Persia. On the other hand, saffron is mentioned in ancient Chinese medical texts, including the forty-volume "Shennong Bencaojing" (神農本草經—"Shennong's Great Herbal", also known as "Pen Ts'ao" or "Pun Tsao") pharmacopoeia, a tome dating from 200–300 BC. Traditionally attributed to the legendary "Yan" ("Fire") Emperor (炎帝) Shennong, it documents 252 phytochemical-based medical treatments for various disorders. Yet around the 3rd century AD, the Chinese were referring to saffron as having a Kashmiri provenance. For example, Wan Zhen, a Chinese medical expert, reported that "[t]he habitat of saffron is in Kashmir, where people grow it principally to offer it to the Buddha." Wan also reflected on how saffron was used in his time: "The [saffron crocus] flower withers after a few days, and then the saffron is obtained. It is valued for its uniform yellow colour. It can be used to aromatise wine."

In Europe, saffron cultivation declined steeply following the Roman Empire's fall. Saffron was reintroduced when the Islamic civilization "Al-Andalus" spread to Spain, France, and Italy. During the 14th century Black Death, demand for saffron-based medicine skyrocketed, and much saffron had to be imported via Venetian and Genoan ships from southern and Mediterranean lands such as Rhodes. The theft of one such shipment by noblemen sparked the fourteen-week long "Saffron War". The conflict and resulting fear of rampant saffron piracy spurred significant saffron cultivation in Basel, which grew prosperous. Cultivation and trade then spread to Nuremberg, where epidemic levels of saffron adulteration brought on the "Safranschou" code, under which saffron adulterers were fined, imprisoned, and executed. Soon after, saffron cultivation spread throughout England, especially Norfolk and Suffolk. The Essex town of Saffron Walden, named for its new specialty crop, emerged as England's prime saffron growing and trading center. However, an influx of more exotic spices such as chocolate, coffee, tea, and vanilla from newly contacted Eastern and overseas countries caused European cultivation and usage of saffron to decline. Only in southern France, Italy, and Spain, did significant cultivation endure.

Europeans brought saffron to the Americas when immigrant members of the Schwenkfelder Church left Europe with a trunk containing saffron corms; indeed, many Schwenkfelders had widely grown saffron in Europe. By 1730, the Pennsylvania Dutch were cultivating saffron throughout eastern Pennsylvania. Spanish colonies in the Caribbean bought large amounts of this new American saffron, and high demand ensured that saffron's list price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was set equal to that of gold. The trade with the Caribbean later collapsed in the aftermath of the War of 1812, when many saffron-transporting merchant vessels were destroyed. Yet the Pennsylvania Dutch continued to grow lesser amounts of saffron for local trade and use in their cakes, noodles, and chicken or trout dishes. American saffron cultivation survived into modern times mainly in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

Pitch (baseball)

A pitch, in baseball, is when a pitcher throws the baseball to the batter. This is a pitcher's main job. The pitcher tries to get the player who is at-bat out. If a pitcher throws three strikes, the batter strikes out (unless the third strike is a foul tip). A strike is when a pitch is in the zone from the batter's knees to the belt and the width of home plate (the "strike zone"), and if the batter does not swing. A strike is also called if a batter swings at any pitch and misses, or if a batter hits a ball into foul territory (this is called a "foul tip"). If a pitcher throws a ball outside of the strike zone and the batter does not swing, this is called a "ball". If four of these are thrown, the batter gets to go to first base for free. This is called a "walk".

Pitchers use different pitches to try to get the batter out. The most common is a fastball. A fastball is when the pitcher throws the ball as hard as he or she can. The pitcher is trying to get the ball past the batter before the batter can hit it. Another type of pitch is a changeup. A pitcher throws a changeup when he or she wants the batter to be swing before the ball gets to home plate. The batter might do this because he or she thinks the pitch is a fastball and the baseball will get to the plate faster. In addition to these two types of pitches, there are also many others.

<doc id="178456" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178456" title="Hanged, drawn and quartered">
Hanged, drawn and quartered

Hanged, drawn and quartered was a punishment. In England, it was used for high treason. 

Until reformed under the Treason Act 1814, the full punishment for the crime of treason was to be "hanged, drawn and quartered" in that the condemned prisoner would be:


Typically, the resulting five parts (i.e. the four quarters of the body and the head) were gibbeted (put on public display) in different parts of the city, town, or, in famous cases, in the country, to deter would-be traitors who had not seen the execution. After 1814, the convict would be hanged until dead and the mutilation would be performed post-mortem. Gibbeting was later abolished in England in 1843, while drawing and quartering was abolished in 1870.

There is debate among modern historians about whether "drawing" referred to the dragging to the place of execution or the disembowelling, but since two different words are used in the official documents detailing the trial of William Wallace (""detrahatur"" for drawing as a method of transport, and ""devaletur"" for disembowelment), there is no doubt that the subjects of the punishment were disembowelled.

Judges delivering sentence at the Old Bailey also seemed to have had some confusion over the term "drawn", and some sentences are summarized as "Drawn, Hanged and Quartered". Nevertheless, the sentence was often recorded quite explicitly. For example, the record of the trial of Thomas Wallcot, John Rouse, William Hone and William Blake for offences against the king, on 12 July 1683 concludes as follows:

The "Oxford English Dictionary" notes both meanings of "drawn": "To draw out the viscera or the like, to the place of execution". It states that "In many cases of executions it is uncertain [which of these senses of "drawn"] is meant. The presumption is that where "drawn" is mentioned after "hanged", the sense is [the second meaning]."

The condemned man would usually be sentenced to the short drop method of hanging, so that the neck would not break. The man was usually dragged alive to the quartering table, although in some cases men were brought to the table dead or unconscious. A splash of water was usually employed to wake the man if unconscious, then he was laid down on the table. A large cut was made in the gut after removing the genitalia, and the intestines would be spooled out on a device that resembled a dough roller. Each piece of organ would be burned before the sufferer's eyes, and when he was completely disembowelled, his head would be cut off. The body would then be cut into four pieces, and the king would decide where they were to be displayed. Usually the head was sent to the Tower of London and, as in the case of William Wallace, the other four pieces were sent to different parts of the country. The head was generally par-boiled in brine to preserve the appearance of the head in display, while the quarters were more often prepared in pitch, for longer-lasting deterrent displays.

Daniel Barenboim

Daniel Barenboim (born Buenos Aires, 15 November 1942) is a pianist and conductor. He is a citizen of Argentina, Israel, Spain, and the Palestinian Authority.

Barenboim (meaning "pear tree" in Yiddish) was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina; his grandparents were Russian Ashkenazi Jews. At first he was famous as a pianist but now he is just as well-known as a conductor. He is particularly important for his work with the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra which works with young Arab and Israeli musicians. Barenboim has often criticized the illegal Israeli settlements on Palestinian land. In 2001 he made many people in Israel angry by conducting the music of Wagner in a concert. Wagner’s music had not been performed in Israel since 1938 because Wagner had been anti-Jewish and because he had been Hitler's favourite composer.

Barenboim was born in Buenos Aires in Argentina. He started piano lessons when he was five. At first his mother taught him, but soon his father became his teacher and he remained the only piano teacher he had. When he was seven years old he gave a concert in Buenos Aires.

In 1952, the Barenboim family moved to Israel. In 1954 he went to Salzburg to take part in Igor Markevitch's conducting classes. There he met famous people such as Wilhelm Furtwängler whose conducting inspired him. Furtwängler was very impressed by the young boy and asked him to play Beethoven’s First Piano Concerto with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, but his father did not want him to play in Berlin because it was too soon after the Nazis had murdered millions of Jews.

In 1955 Barenboim studied harmony and composition with Nadia Boulanger in Paris.

Barenboim played the piano in Vienna and Rome in 1952, Paris in 1955, London in 1956. In 1957 he played in New York with Leopold Stokowski conducting. He then toured Europe, the United States, South America, Australia and the Far East. He made many recordings as a pianist.

In 1967 he conducted the Philharmonia Orchestra. Soon many orchestras wanted him to conduct them. Between 1975 and 1989 he was music director of the Orchestre de Paris, where he conducted a lot of music by 20th century composers. 

He first conducted an opera in 1973 when he directed a performance of Mozart's "Don Giovanni" at the Edinburgh Festival. He made his first appearance at Bayreuth in 1981 and he often conducted there until 1999. 

Barenboim was conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra from 1991 to 2006.

Barenboim now lives in Berlin. He is the conductor of the "Staatsoper Unter den Linden" (Berlin State Opera) and the Berlin Staatskapelle. He is now conductor for life at the Berlin State Opera.

Barenboim has given many lectures about music including the Reith Lecture in 2006.

He was given the honour of conducting the world famous New Year's Day Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra on 1 January 2009.

In 2008 Barenboim first conducted at the Metropolitan Opera in New York at a performance of Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde".

Barenboim still performs as a pianist. In 2006 he played all Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas in the Royal Festival Hall, London in a series of concerts. In 2010 he played a series of concerts with the Berlin Staatskapelle, playing all Beethoven's piano concertos.

Barenboim has made many recordings including twice recording all Beethoven’s Piano Sonatas. He recorded a lot of chamber with his first wife, Jacqueline du Pré, the violinist Itzhak Perlman, and the violinist and violist Pinchas Zukerman. He has made many recordings as conductor, including all the symphonies of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner and Schumann, and many operas by Wagner.

Barenboim wrote a book called "Everything is Connected" in which he writes about music being a metaphor for life and society.

As well as the famous classical composers he has performed 20th century music, Baroque music and tangos from Argentina.

In 2001 he made many people in Israel angry because he conducted Wagner’s music at a concert there. Wagner was not allowed to be performed in Israel because he had been anti-Jewish. He changed the programme, but then decided to play some Wagner as an encore at the end of the concert. He spoke to the audience and said that anyone who did not want to hear the music could leave the hall. There was an argument for half an hour. In the end some people left, but most of them stayed and listened, and then applauded enthusiastically at the end.

Barenboim has given performances in the West Bank to show that he has sympathy with the Palestinians. The Israeli government told him it would be too dangerous to go to Ramallah, but he went into the town during the night to give a piano recital. 

In 1999, Barenboim started the West-Eastern Divan orchestra with the help of a Palestinian-American professor Edward Said, who was a close friend.
The orchestra brings young musicians from Israel and Arab countries together every summer. They give concerts all over the world.

Barenboim has won many prizes and has been awarded many honorary degrees.

Daniel Barenboim married the famous British cellist Jacqueline du Pré at the Western Wall, Jerusalem in 1967. They gave concerts and made recordings together until Jacqueline became ill with multiple sclerosis and retired in 1973. There is a famous film by Christopher Nupen of them playing Schubert’s "Trout" Quintet with Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zukerman and Zubin Mehta. 

Du Pré died in 1987. In 1988 Barenboim married the Russian pianist Elena Bashkirova. They have two sons. The younger son, Michael, is now a violinist and often performs with his father.

West-Eastern Divan Orchestra

The West-Eastern Divan is an orchestra for young people. It is based in Sevilla, Spain. The musicians in the orchestra come from Israel and its surrounding Arab countries.

The orchestra was started in 1999 by the Jewish conductor Daniel Barenboim and the Palestinian-American academic Edward Said (pronounce: Sah—eed). The name of the orchestra comes from a group of poems by the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

The West-Eastern Divan Orchestra was started to help bring Israelis and Palestinians together to work for peace and to help solve the fight between Israel and Palestine. The idea was to let Israelis and Arabs work together in countries which had nothing to do with the conflict.

The first workshop of the orchestra took place in Weimar, Germany because it was the 1999 European cultural town. Barenboim chose two leaders for the orchestra: one Israeli and one Arab. They worked with some very famous musicians including the cellist Yo Yo Ma. In 2000 the orchestra met again in Weimar, in 2001 they met in Chicago. Since 2002 they have met every year in Seville. 

The West-Eastern Divan Workshop takes place during several weeks each summer in Andalusia. After the workshop has finished, the orchestra travel to other places to give concerts. They have given concerts in many parts of Europe, North America, South America. In 2004 they performed an historic concert in Ramallah in Palestine. After the concert Barenboim said that the people of Israel and Palestine had a shared future. He said: “Either we all kill each other, or we share what there is to share. It is this message that we come here to bring."

In 2004, the Barenboim-Said Foundation, based in Seville, was started to help develop several education projects. Money is given for this by the Junta de Andalucía (Regional Government of Andalusia). The Foundation helps with the orchestra as well as with projects such as the Early Childhood Musical Education Project in Seville.

The orchestra has won prizes and made recordings. A film called "Knowledge is the Beginning" was made about them.

In August 2009 the orchestra will give three concerts at the BBC Proms including a concert performance of Beethoven’s opera Fidelio which has a story about people who have been put in prison for their political ideas.

India-Taiwan relations

The bilateral relations between the Republic of India and Taiwan have improved since the 1990s, India has expanded economic and strategic cooperation with Taiwan.

Owing to the strategic rivalry, suspicion and tenuous relations between the People's Republic of China and India since the 1962 war, India has slowly sought to develop better commercial and strategic cooperation with Taiwan even while ruling out the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations. Taiwan has also viewed India's rising geopolitical standing as a potential counter-balance to China's dominance in the region. As a part of its "Look East" foreign policy, India has sought to cultivate extensive ties with Taiwan in trade as well as working together over weapons of mass destruction issues, environment and fighting terrorism. Both sides have aimed to develop ties to counteract Chinese rivalry with both nations. The India-Taipei Association (ITA) Office has been established in Taipei since 1995 to promote non-governmental interactions between India and Taiwan, and to facilitate business, tourism, cultural and people-to-people exchanges. The India-Taipei Association has also been authorised to provide all consular and passport services. In 2002, India became the 28th nation to sign the Investment Protection Agreement with Taiwan and in 2006, both nations established the Taiwan-India Cooperation Council. Furthermore, Taiwan promotes trade with India as a means to reduce the extent of their economic dependence with China. In 2007, Ma Ying-jeou, the leader of the Kuomintang, Taiwan's largest political party supportive of reunification, and a major candidate in the 2008 presidential elections made an unofficial visit to India.

Intermodal perception

Intermodal Perception is the integration of information gathered from two or more stimuli of different sensory modes. That is to say using more than one of your five senses together. Many actions provide both an auditory and visual stimulus, that the brain perceives as a unit, for example playing a guitar and strumming, the brain connects these individual stimuli one auditory and one visual. This seems very trivial and is easily taken for granted, in adults, but could present challenges for infants.

Elizabeth Spelke, a cognitive psychologist, Tested Infants ability to match both auditory and visual stimuli in 1979 with this experiment. Four month old infants were shown two videos at the same time, both played music and displayed puppets dancing. In one of the videos the puppets movements were synchronized with the music, in the second, they were not. Spelke determined that infants looked more at the video in which the movements were synchronized than the video were they were not by measuring their gaze. This supports the idea that infants can match auditory and visual stimuli through Intermodal Perception.

It is thought that a newborn possesses very crude ability to match auditory with visual stimuli. Newborns will often look in the direction of an object making noise, but auditory and visual perception are not developed enough at this point to accurately make intermodal perceptions. This ability to mentally connect stimuli from different modes of perception, is possessed in a crude form for the first six months of an infants life, but develops from significantly from six months to a year in age.

The term stagflation is sometimes used to describe a situation in which there is slow to zero growth in real output (total amount of goods and services produced), high inflation exists, and unemployment is higher than normal. This situation usually begins with rising prices at times when production is declining. Because of declining production, unemployment also increases. All three of these factors combined cause stagflation—stagnation in production and employment together with increasing inflation. It is also because of cost push factors. Because when the cost is rising, prices would go up and because of uncertainity, the investors will hesitate for investment so there will be unemployment.

The conductor George Szell made them into one of the world's best orchestras. When he started conducting them after World War II he told twelve of the players that they had to leave. Another twelve musicians were so angry that they left as well. Szell then improved the orchestra during the 24 years he was with them.

The Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) is an American orchestra based in Boston, Massachusetts. It is one of the great orchestras of the world. They give concerts in the Symphony Hall, Boston. They also play every summer at the Tanglewood Festival.

The orchestra was started in 1881. Many of the conductors it had during its history were extremely famous, including Arthur Nikisch from 1889 to 1893, and Pierre Monteux from 1919 to 1924 who gave the orchestra a reputation for a "French" sound which many people think it still has today. Serge Koussevitzky was their conductor for many years and made them a world-class orchestra. With Koussevitzky, the orchestra gave radio broadcasts and made its summer home at Tanglewood, where Koussevitzky founded the Berkshire Music Center, which is now the Tanglewood Music Center. 

Koussevitzky asked many famous composers to write music for the orchestra. Works written especially for them include "Symphony No. 4" by Sergei Prokofiev and the "Symphony of Psalms" by Igor Stravinsky. They also gave the first performance of Béla Bartók's "Concerto for Orchestra". Since then many other composers have written for the orchestra including Roger Sessions, Andrzej Panufnik and Elliott Carter.

When the conductor Charles Munch took over from Koussevitzky he gave the orchestra their first tour overseas. He was followed in 1962 by Erich Leinsdorf, then William Steinberg, Seiji Ozawa and, since 2004, James Levine who is the first American-born conductor of the orchestra.

As well as the Boston Symphony Orchestra there is also the Boston Pops Orchestra, founded in 1885, which plays light music, e.g. from show tunes. Arthur Fiedler conducted them from 1930 until 1979. He was followed by the film composer John Williams. Today their conductor is Keith Lockhart.

A small group of principal players from the BSO form the Boston Symphony Chamber Players. They have being playing since 1964 and perform in Boston, Tanglewood and in other places in USA and Europe. They have made many recordings.

The Boston Symphony have made many recordings with their conductors since 1917 when they made one of the earliest music recordings conducted by Karl Muck.

Light music is a musical style that might often be called "easy listening". It started in the United Kingdom in the 19th century and became very popular in the middle of the 20th century.

Light music was often played at seaside resorts. It often consisted of arrangements for orchestra of popular songs. It was music that was supposed to be popular, music that a wide audience would be able to enjoy.

In the 1930s, when the BBC started broadcasting music on the radio (which they then called "wireless"), light music became very popular. In 1945 the BBC Light Programme was started. One very popular programme was called "Friday Night is Music Night", with music played by the BBC Concert Orchestra. and "Music While You Work" was also a very popular programme.

Today Light Music is sometimes seen as not in fashion. Film music is more popular today, and music from musicals.

Eric Coates is a good example of a composer of Light Music. His piece "By the Sleepy Lagoon" became the signature tune of a radio programme called "Desert Island Discs". Arthur Wood's "Barwick Green" became the theme of "The Archers".

In the United States popular light pieces were written by people such as Leroy Anderson and George Gershwin.

Bridge to Terabithia (2007 movie)

Bridge to Terabithia is a fantasy film. It was released in 2007. The director of the film was Gábor Csupó. It was adapted for a film by David L. Paterson and Jeff Stockwell. The film is based on the Katherine Paterson novel of the same name. Walt Disney Pictures distributed the film in the U.S.A. Bridge to Terabithia tells the story of two 12-year-old neighbours, Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke. They spend their free time in an abandoned tree house where they create a fantasy world called Terabithia.

David Paterson, who wrote the screenplay, is Katherine Paterson's son. The novel is based on parts of his childhood. When he asked his mother if he could write a screenplay of the novel, she agreed. This was because he could write plays well. Production of the film began in February 2006. The film was shot by November. It was shot mainly in Auckland, New Zealand within two months. It took ten weeks to edit the film. Post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took many months.

"Bridge to Terabithia" was released in the U.S.A. and Canada on February 16, 2007. The film was successful in terms of earnings. With a budget of around $20 million, it collected US$137 million worldwide. The film received positive reviews. Critics called it faithful to the children's novel. They said the visuals and performances made the film imaginative. "Bridge to Terabithia" was nominated for seven awards. It won five of them at the Young Artist Awards.

Jesse "Jess" Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is a fifth grader who wants to be an artist. He lives with his financially poor family in Lark Creek. He rides the bus to school with his little sister, May Belle (Bailee Madison). He avoids the school bully, Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton). In class, his classmates, Scott Hoager (Cameron Wakefield) and Gary Fulcher (Elliot Lawless) tease him. A new student his age named Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb) comes to the school. At recess, Jess enters a running event, for which he had been training at home. Leslie also enters it. She manages to beat all the boys, including Jess. This irritates Jess. While going home, Jess and Leslie learn that they are next-door neighbors.

Later in the evening, Jess becomes angry to find his sister has drawn in his notebook. His strict father (Robert Patrick) sides with her. The next day at school, Leslie praises Jess' drawing ability. This is after she sees his notebook. They soon become best friends. After school, they go into the woods. There, they swing across a creek on a rope. Jess and Leslie find an abandoned tree house and a broken down truck on the other side of the creek. They invent a new world, which they call "Terabithia". The fantasy world reflects their lives. It comes to life as they explore the area. For the next few days, Jess and Leslie spend their free time in the tree house and learn about one another.

Leslie gives Jess an art kit for his birthday. This pleases Jess very much. Later, he gives her a puppy. She names it Prince Terrien. Once in Terabithia, they fight with various creatures, including a troll that looks like Janice Avery, the school bully. At school, May Belle shows her friend Alexandra what she has for her snack, Twinkies. Jess tells her that she should not brag about them. At recess, May Belle tells Jess and Leslie that Janice stole her Twinkies. Leslie becomes frustrated by Janice's fee for entering the toilet. Jess and Leslie play a trick on Janice. Everyone laughs at her at the bus for this. 

Once Leslie's parents finish writing their book, she and Jess help paint their house. Jess is impressed by her parents' happiness and watches the family. At school on Friday, Leslie hears Janice crying in the bathroom. After Leslie talks with her, she learns that the reason why Janice is a bully is because she is abused by her father. They become friends. Jess and Leslie take Prince Terrein to Terabithia. There they fight off several creatures that look like students at their school. They decide to go home when it starts raining. The creek gets higher than ever due to the rain.

The next morning, Ms. Edmunds (Zooey Deschanel), Jess' music teacher, invites him on a one-on-one field trip to an art museum. Jess tries to ask his mother's permission. As she is half-asleep, he takes her mumbling as approval. Jess does not ask Leslie to come with him. When he returns home, Jess finds that his father and mother are worried. This is because they did not know where he was. His father tells him that Leslie drowned in the river that morning. This happened when Jess went to the museum. Jess is very sad to hear this. He visits the Burke family home with his parents to pay their respects. Leslie's father, Bill Burke (Latham Gaines), tells Jess that she loved him. He thanks him for being a very good friend to her, since she could not make friends at her old school. Jess feels very guilty for Leslie's death. His father consoles him to keep their friendship alive for her sake. Jess decides to re-imagine Terabithia and builds a bridge across the river to welcome a new ruler. He invites his sister, May Belle to enter Terabithia. She is delighted because she was not allowed to enter before. She and Jess make Terabithia even better, with Jess as king and his sister as princess.

Production for the film began in February 2006, with a budget of around $20 million. The main photography for the film was shot in Auckland, New Zealand in sixty days. Film editing took ten weeks. Post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took a few months. The film was finished by November 2006. This was because the crew "had to rush" to finish it by February 16. The film was directed by Gábor Csupó. Walden Media President Cary Granat first recommended him to direct the film. Csupó had never done a live-action film before. However, he said it "didn't worry Granat in the least". Csupó noted that he was interested in making the film. He "had the ambition to do a live-action film for a long time", but that he "didn't like anything until I read this book". He called the book "beautiful" and said that it "moved [him]". The cinematographer of "Bridge to Terabithia" was Michael Chapman. This was his final film before he retired. Chapman mentioned in the film's DVD commentary that he retired after the film because he wanted his last film to be a good one. He said: "this is such a beautiful story, and it's exactly the kind of movie I want to do at this time in my life".

Director Csupó stated they had thought of no actors for the film at first. The first actor cast was AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie Burke. Robb wrote Csupó "such a beautiful, heartwarming letter" that showed she loved the book and character. Csupó said Robb was cast for the film because of "her letter, her enthusiasm, and her love of the material". Robb also talked with Lauren Levine, the producer of the film, before casting even began. "[T]heir conversation convinced her that, without a doubt, AnnaSophia was meant for this role," Csupó stated. Levine said "it was just so clear in talking to her about all this fantasy that I was basically talking to Leslie, that she had that same kind of spark and magical presence. She might be physically different from Leslie in the book, but the spirit of Leslie and the spirit of AnnaSophia are nearly identical. It was a match made in heaven." With regard to the character, Robb said "[Leslie]'s one of those people who's just always lit up, who has this glow about her, and no one can bring her down. Leslie's such a lively and energetic character, it was really fun for me to become her."

Levine noted that "looking for Jess was a really tough hunt. We needed someone who could go from an introverted boy in an isolated world to someone who completely taps into his imagination and becomes a confident, brave leader in Terabithia. That's a heck of a range for such a young actor." Josh Hutcherson was not their first choice for the role of Jess Aarons. He was chosen as they "felt the chemistry between AnnaSophia Robb and him". Hutcherson said that he liked the project because of "the real life day-to-day drama as well as the arc of the character Jess".

The filmmakers cast Robert Patrick as Jess' father. He was chosen due to his experience in several films in the past. Patrick explained that he could relate to the plot. He was "constantly creating imaginary worlds as a kid" himself, and that the film reminded him of the place where he grew up. He also said that he agreed to act because it was a film his children could watch.

Bailee Madison was cast as May Belle Aarons. Csupó said they searched for a long time for someone to play her role. She had "such a charm, even before the camera, she was just like a little sweetheart," he said. She was confident, shook hands with everybody and was "totally sweet and perky". Csupó was pleased by her attitude and cast her for the film.

Csupó explained that "it was a very conscious decision from the very beginning that we're not going to overdo the visual effects because of the story's integrity and the book's integrity." There was only a small mention of Jess and Leslie fighting creatures in Terabithia in the book. For this reason, they "tried to do the absolute minimum, which would be required to put it into a movie version".

To design the creatures of Terabithia, Csupó wanted to use "little more artsy, imaginative, fantastical creatures than the typical rendered characters you see in other movies." He was inspired by Terry Gilliam and Ridley Scott. Dima Malanitchev drew the creatures. Csupó helped him in this. Csupó chose Weta Digital render the 3D animation. He "was impressed with their artistic integrity, the teamwork, the [fact that] people were really nice, and also they responded to our designs very positively." Weta modified some of the creature designs. However, they mainly used Csupó's original designs.

100 crew members from Weta worked for the film. Weta was doing the animations when the film was being shot. Weta crew members saw the shooting of all scenes involving these creatures. Weta's Matt Aitken said the process of animation was "split into two steps". First, natural-looking creatures were created based on pencil sketches by Csupó and Malanitchev. Photoshop pictures made by visual effects art director Michael Pangrazio was used for this. The second step was to use the best animation and motion style for the creatures.

Leslie's costumes in the film were designed to look as if the character "might have made some of them herself". They were updated from those described in the book. This was because the descriptions in the book would appear odd now.

Producer and screenwriter David L. Paterson is the novel's author's son. His name was featured on its dedication page. The story was based on his real life best friend, Lisa Hill. Hill had been struck by lightning. She was killed when they were both eight years old. Paterson had asked his mother, Katherine Paterson, if he could write a screenplay of the novel. She agreed "not only because he's [her] son, but also because he's a very good playwright". Paterson found it difficult to market his screenplay. It was mainly because of Leslie's death. "[I]f you can believe this, I did meet with some companies that asked if I could just 'hurt' Leslie a little bit—put her in a light coma and then bring her out".

Paterson said it was very important for him to keep the spirit of the book alive. At the same time, he had to change it from "a novel that takes place mostly in the characters' heads to a dynamic visual medium". Paterson knew that the film had to be about friendship and imagination. He focused "bringing out the emotions of the story." He said he found it difficult to write about Terabithia. This was "because it was too close". He credited fellow screenwriter Jeff Stockwell for recreating Terabithia for the film. "What Jeff was able to do as an outsider who wasn’t so attached to the story was to really let his imagination go free and make up this world in a wonderful way", David said. Csupó said that the two main characters are a little bit older in the film. Csupó claims the movie "deals with so many issues including friendship, and maybe first innocent love, things like that", so it "made more sense" to make the characters older.

The film's musical score was composed by Aaron Zigman. He was hired after Alison Krauss did not compose the music. Zigman said there are similarities between the music he made fro "Bridge to Terabithia" and the film "Flicka". He said: "[...]at times there's a bit of a Celtic influence but not much", but he also went on to say that there was a more modern feel to the music he composed for "Bridge to Terabithia". The score he composed for the film is described as "very large" compared to his other work, and Zigman commented that "Aside from the minimalist stuff and coloring that I love to do, I also like big orchestral stuff, and want to do more of that, and this film enabled me to spread my wings out a bit." The official soundtrack for the film was released by "Hollywood Records" on February 13, 2007.

Reviewers criticized the film's advertisement campaign. One critic said the film was actually "grounded in reality far more than in fantasy." Another thought, "far from a computer generated [created] escapist fantasy, this film is an unpretentious [not pretending] and touching tale of preteen companionship and loss".

The film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on February 16, 2007. Paterson, who studied in The Catholic University of America, held a special advance screening of the film for them. This was shown at the AFI Silver Theatre in Silver Spring, Maryland on February 1, 2007. The film opened in the UK on May 4, 2007, and in New Zealand June 7, 2007. The film grossed "a higher-than-expected" $28,536,717 from 2,284 screens. It earned an average of $9,885 per screen. The opening day had collections of $6.3 million. The film has a worldwide gross of US$120 million. It grossed $80 million in the US and Canada.

The DVD and Blu-ray Disc were released on June 19, 2007 in the US. The DVD and Blu-ray version had "Digital Imagination: Bringing Terabithia to Life", "Behind the Book: The Themes of "Bridge to Terabithia"" It also had "Keep Your Mind Wide Open" music video by Robb, and two audio commentaries. The first was with director Csupó, writer Jeff Stockwell, and producer Hal Lieberman. The second was with producer Lauren Levine and actors Hutcherson and Robb.

Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes said 85% of 137 collected reviews for "Bridge to Terabithia" were positive. The average score was 7.1/10. Critics said the film was "a faithful adaptation of a beloved children's novel and a powerful portrayal of love, loss, and imagination through children's eyes. Dynamic visuals and natural performances further enhance the imaginative film". At Metacritic, the film got 74 out of 100 from 25 reviews. This meant it received "generally favorable reviews".

James Berardinelli of ReelViews called "Bridge to Terabithia" "easily the best family feature of the early year". Ann Hornaday of "The Washington Post" praised the script. She said it was "utterly recognizable and authentic", and thought Robb and Hutcherson were "perfectly cast". Hornaday said the final five minutes showed "oversweet sentiment." Viewers would remember the film's "warmth and respect with which it pays homage [respect] to first love," she added. Jessica Grose of "The Village Voice" praised director Csupó for not showing "cutesy tween [neither a child, nor a teenager] stereotypes." She felt Jess' relationship with his father made "Bridge to Terabithia" from "a good kids movie to a classic contender". "The New York Times" Jeannette Catsoulis believed that the fantasy was kept in the background "to find magic in the everyday", and thought Csupó directed "like someone intimate with the pain of being different, allowing each personality more than a single characteristic". She particularly praised Deschanel and Madison. Catsoulis said the film handled adult topics with "with nuance [cleverly] and sensitivity". Since it was smart and "delicate as a spider web", it was the kind of children's movie "rarely seen nowadays". Miriam di Nunzio of the "Chicago Sun-Times" praised Hutcherson and Robb's performances. "[T]he film's heart and soul rests on the abilities of its young lead characters to make us really see the world through children's eyes. The dynamic duo of Hutcherson and Robb do not disappoint," she noted.

Not all reviews were positive. Claudia Puig of "USA Today" said "for a movie about the power of imagination, "Bridge to Terabithia" is not as clever as you would hope". Puig said it was an average translation of the novel. But the adult characters were too caricatured or exaggerated in the film. The real-life portions of the movie were "derivative and simplistic", but Jess' emotional feelings seemed "powerfully authentic, and this is where the film finds its truth and soul". "The Wall Street Journal" critic Joe Morgenstern felt the film overused fantasy. The critic added that the "agreeable simplicity in between computer-generated monsters". The young members of the cast were "appealing but unpolished". Morgenstern thought Csupó lacked experience in direction. Although Deschanel was the best among the adults, she seemed self-directed.

"Bridge to Terabithia" was nominated for seven awards. It won five of these. Josh Hutcherson was nominated at the 2008 Saturn Awards for "Best Performance by a Younger Actor". AnnaSophia Robb was nominated for a Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for "Best Young Actress". The film won five awards at the Young Artist Awards. This included "Best Family Feature Film (Fantasy or Musical)" and "Best Performance in a Feature Film – Leading Young Actor" for Hutcherson. Robb won "Best Performance in a Feature Film – Leading Young Actress", and Bailee Madison won "Best Performance in a Feature Film – Young Actress Age Ten or Younger". The cast also won the award for "Best Performance in a Feature Film – Young Ensemble Cast". The cast included Hutcherson, Robb, Madison, Wakefield, Clinton, Lawless, Isabelle Rose Kircher, Carly Owen, Devon Wood, Emma Fenton and Grace Brannigan.

Terrestrial planet

A terrestrial planet is mostly made of rock (silicate) and may, or may not, have much atmosphere. Earth is the "original" terrestrial planet and we extended the term to include our nearest rocky neighbours: Mercury, Venus and Mars. It is often said that they are similar to Earth. However this similarity is not meant to include the planets' surface conditions. It is the bulk structure and composition which is similar, not the atmosphere.

With the discovery of planets orbiting other stars (exoplanets), the term terrestrial planet has been extended again to any planet which is similar to Earth orbiting any star.

All have a core, a mantle, and a crust. These structures can be compared to a boiled egg; the central yolk is the core; the white albumin is the mantle; and the shell is the crust. The crust of a terrestrial planet is comparatively thin, with the core and the mantle taking up the vast bulk, sometimes with a very large core, sometimes much smaller.

Our terrestrial planets have metallic cores of mostly iron, with rocky mantles and crusts.

Cheating

Cheating happens when someone breaks rules or lies. Cheating can be done in many ways. Some students cheat on a test by copying someone else's answers and writing secret notes. This is can get them kicked out of school. People who break the rules of a game are cheating. For example, if someone holds the ball when playing soccer, they are cheating.

When someone is in a relationship with another person and they kiss, date or have sex with someone else, they are cheating on the person they are in a relationship with.

Local and national governments have laws. If someone breaks the law, they can be punished. If someone cheats in a way that is not illegal, they cannot be punished by law. Some common punishments include jail and fines.

Organizations, such as schools, can have rules. Rules are not laws, but people can still be punished for breaking a rule.

The first cheat in video games was thought to be the "Konami Code", a code Konami used to test a game that was too hard for them to do alone. See cheat code for more on cheating in video games.

<doc id="178779" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178779" title="Mania">
Mania

Mania is a severe medical condition characterized by an extremely strong mood. Maniacs are very energetic, they have unusual thought patterns. Some maniacs show signs of psychosis. The word itself comes from from Greek "μανία" ("Mania") and that from "μαίνομαι" - "mainomai", "to rage, to be furious".

Mania is just a symptom, and not an illness as such. There are many causes for it, including wrongly using drugs, or using them for fun, as well as tumors of the brain. Most of the time, it is associated with bipolar disorder, though. In bipolar disorder, there are episodes of mania that alternate with ones of clinical depression. These cycles may be influenced by patterns in nature, as well as stress. 

Like with other illnesses, there are different levels of mania. Mild forms are usually known as hypomania, stronger forms may include psychosis, with hallucinations and delusions. 

In some cases, manic patients need to be hospitalized for protection (against themselves, and so that they cannot harm others). On the other hand, mania and hypomania have also been associated with creavtivity and artistic talent.

Symptoms of mania include talking very fast, racing thoughts, less need for sleep, impulsiveness, and increased interest in goal-directed activities. The affected person may behave unusually. They may spend lots of money, engage in risky sexual activity, or act unusual around other people. These behaviors can cause stress in everyday life.

Another symptom of mania is racing thoughts during which the sufferer is excessively distracted by unimportant stimuli. This negative experience creates an inability to function and an absentmindedness where the manic individual's thoughts totally preoccupy him or her, making him or her unable to keep track of time or be aware of anything besides the neurological pattern of thoughts. 

Although "severely elevated mood" sounds somewhat desirable and enjoyable, the experience of mania is often quite unpleasant and sometimes disturbing, if not frightening, for the person involved (and those close to them), and may lead to impulsive behavior that may later be regretted. It can also often be complicated by the sufferer's lack of judgment and insight regarding periods of exacerbation of symptoms. There are different levels of mania.

It is possible to treat mania using a combination of drugs and therapy. Before starting the treatment, an exact medical diagnosis of the causes of mania must be done. This needs to be done to rule out that the mania is caused for example by a tumor. If this was the case, treating the tumor would be better (and would also take care of the mania). 

The mania in bipolar disorder is usually treated using a combination of mood stabilizers and antipsychotic drugs. During the treatment, the patient needs to be monitored to rule out (or treat) certain side-effects. The patient may also need medical supervision until he or she is stabilized, that is until no more manic episodes occur. 
When the symptoms of mania have gone, long-term treatment then focuses on prophylactic treatment to try to stabilize the patient's mood. Very often, this is done using a combination of drugs and psychotherapy.

Lithium is the classic mood stabilizer to prevent further manic and depressive episodes. Anticonvulsants such as valproic acid and carbamazepine are also used for prophylaxis. More recent drug solutions include lamotrigine. Clonazepam (Rivotril, Ravotril or Rivatril) is also used.

The calcium-channel blocker, verapamil is useful in the treatment of hypomania and in those cases where lithium and mood stabilizers are contraindicated or ineffective.. Verapamil is effective for both short-term and long-term treatment.

Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra

The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) is an American orchestra from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They play in the Heinz Hall. 

The orchestra was started in 1895. Several of the musicians had come from the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The earliest conductors were Archer, Victor Herbert and Emil Paur. Famous guest conductors included Edward Elgar and Richard Strauss. In 1910 the orchestra had to stop playing because they had no money.

In 1926 the orchestra was started again. The musicians were not paid, and they gave money to make it possible for the orchestra to continue. It started to become a good orchestra in 1937 when Otto Klemperer was asked to take the orchestra and reorganize it. Since then the orchestra has developed and become an international orchestra.

Fritz Reiner (1938-48) conducted the orchestra for ten years. It was not easy during the war because the musicians often had to go to fight in the war and others came instead. From 1948-52, several famous conductors led the orchestra, including Leonard Bernstein and Leopold Stokowski.

When William Steinberg took over from 1952-76 he took them on tour to Europe and made many recordings. He was followed by André Previn who helped the orchestra to make a television series "Previn and the Pittsburgh". Lorin Maazel, who came from Pittsburgh, conducted them until 1996, taking them on several international tours. Mariss Jansons followed Maazel from 1997-2004. After he left the orchestra had guest conductors but not a musical director (main conductor) for four years. In 2008 the Austrian conductor Manfred Honeck was made music director. Leonard Slatkin is the main guest conductor.

In 2004, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra with conductor Gilbert Levine became the first American orchestra to play for the Pope.

<doc id="178812" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178812" title="Andrea del Verrocchio">
Andrea del Verrocchio

Andrea del Verrocchio (c. 1435 – 1488) was an Italian sculptor, goldsmith and painter. He had an important workshop in Florence. Many other Renaissance painters were Verrocchio's apprentices or worked in his workshop. These included Botticelli, Ghirlandaio and Perugino. Verrocchio's most famous apprentice was Leonardo da Vinci. 
Verrocchio was born in Florence in 1435. His father was Michele di Francesco Cioni who was not married to Verrocchio's mother. Michele made tiles and bricks. Later he worked as a tax collector. He worked for the Medici family of bankers, then he moved to Venice. 

When Verrocchio was born, he was named Andrea di Francesco di Cioni. His name was changed to Andrea del Verrocchio when he was apprenticed to a goldsmith called Verrocchio (who was probably Francesco di Luca Verrocchio, who was very rich and successful). As an apprentice to a goldsmith, Verrocchio would have learnt how to make jewellery and golden tableware such as plates, dishes, jugs and salt containers. He would have learnt how to hammer gold into thin sheets called "gold leaf" and use it to decorate picture frames, statues and illuminated manuscripts. He also learnt how to make bronze statues. Verrocchio's bronze statues are his most famous works. 

At this time Verrocchio would have met Donatello. Donatello became one of the most famous sculptors ever. He made many more statues than Verrocchio. However, Donatello and Verrocchio both made a statue of David with the head of Goliath, and both made a huge statue of a famous soldier on horseback (equestrian statue). Art historians often compare the two Davids and the two equestrian statues. 

It is thought that Verrocchio began painting in the 1460s, when he worked at Prato with the painter Fra Filippo Lippi. There is only one known painting that was signed by Verrocchio. This is an altarpiece of the "Madonna and Child with Saints" in the Cathedral of Pistoia, painted in the late 1470s. There are several more paintings from Verrocchio's studio. They have probably been painted partly by Verrocchio and partly by his students. 

The most famous of these paintings was done between 1472 and 1475. It is a "Baptism of Christ". Giorgio Vasari writing in his book "Lives of the Great Artists" says that the angel on the left was painted by Leonardo da Vinci. Vasari says that when Verrocchio saw how beautifully the eighteen-year-old apprentice could paint, he put down his brush and never painted again. On close examination, it can be seen that most of the painting is painted in old-fashioned tempera, but the angel, parts of Jesus' body, and the background landscape have been painted in the new technique of oil painting. This makes art historians think that Leonardo worked on many parts of this picture. It has also been suggested that Botticelli painted the second angel.

Verrochio made two large beautiful things out of stone, a coffin and a wash basin. He is thought to have also carved a Madonna and Child in low relief (an almost-flat stone picture). 

Verrocchio's most famous sculptures are made in bronze which is a sort of metal. To make a bronze statue, Verrocchio made the statue in wax. Then plaster was put over the wax, and the wax was removed, leaving a mould. The metal was heated over a furnace until it melted and became molten (liquid). The molten metal was poured into the mould and slowly allowed to cool. When the plaster was chipped away, the bronze statue was inside. The statue then needed to be finished and polished.

The Church of San Lorenzo (St Lawrence) was a new church in Florence. It was built by the architect Brunelleschi in the new style of the Renaissance. The Medici family were the most important patrons of this church. The family chose Verrocchio as the sculptor to make three works for San Lorenzo. 

In 1465 Verrocchio made a wash basin for the room of San Lorenzo's where the robes and Communion vessels were kept. (It is now called the "Old Sacristy".) Above the basin is carved an eagle, the symbol of St John the Evangelist. On the bowl of the basin is carved the Medici coat of arms. Verrocchio then had to design a tomb for Cosimo, the famous banker, and grandfather of the Medici family. 

In the early 1470s Lorenzo de' Medici gave him the job of designing the tomb of Lorenzo's father Piero and uncle Giovanni. The tomb that Verrocchio designed was very unusual. He made a large "sarcophagus" (stone coffin) out of beautiful dark red stone, trimmed with green stone and sculptured leaves of bronze. Instead of being placed against a wall in the usual way, the tomb was designed to stand in an archway leading into the Sacristy. Verrocchio designed a net that looks as if it is made of rope, but is made of bronze. This network makes a screen in the archway, so that people who look at the tomb can see through into the sacristy.

The most unusual church in Florence is Orsanmichele. This building is an ancient corn-market that had, painted on the wall, a precious image of the "Madonna and Child". The corn-market was turned into a church, and the sides of the building, which used to be open, were given walls. The walls had "niches" which is a hollow that a statue can stand in. The niches were big enough for life-sized statues. Many people worked at different jobs in the city of Florence. The people of different jobs belonged to organisations called "guilds". Every important guild in the city wanted to have a statue of their patron saint in a niche at Orsanmichele Church. The statues were made by some of the finest sculptors of Florence. 

In 1466 the Guild of Traders gave Verrocchio the job of making a bronze statue of their saint, St Thomas. Verrocchio made a group of two figures which shows the most important moment in the story of St Thomas. At the back of the niche stands the figure of Jesus, raising one hand to Heaven. St Thomas stands at the edge of the niche, looking at Jesus in amazement and reaching out his hand to touch the spear-wound in Jesus' side. Verrocchio's statue was admired for the way in which he had fitted the two figures into the space, and the way in which he had told the story. 

At about this time Verrocchio also made a huge brass candlestick for the Palazzo Vecchio (the town hall). This candlestick is now in Amsterdam. 

In the 1470s, Lorenzo Medici and his brother Giuliano gave Verrocchio the job of making a statue of David. David, a shepherd boy in a story from the Bible, had killed the giant, Goliath. He was one of the patrons of the city. Nowadays there are at least eight statues of David in Florence, the most famous one being by Michelangelo. 

When Verrocchio made his statue, the most famous "David" in Florence was a life-sized bronze statue by Donatello. This statue shows David naked, except for his boots and hat. The figure stands gracefully, looking down at the giant head at his feet. It looks very much like an Ancient Greek statue. Verrochio's statue of David is very different, even though it is a similar size and is also made of bronze. 

Verrocchio's statue looks like a real-live boy, dressed in modern parade clothes. He does not stand elegantly. His muscles are all drawn tight. He grips the handle of the sword so tightly that the sinews of his arm stand out. The muscles of his face are pulled into the silly grin that people sometimes get when they are very frightened. Verrocchio's David has just killed the giant, but now he is facing the whole enemy army and wondering what will happen next. The handsome boy that Verrocchio used as his model for David is believed to have been Leonardo da Vinci. 

The Medici also gave Verrocchio the job of making a bronze statue of a "Cherub with a Dolphin" to go in the fountain of their home in the countryside. The statue now stands in the small courtyard of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence.

In 1478 Verrocchio began work on his most famous statue. It is a "equestrian statue", a statue of a man on horseback. The statue was made for the Republic of Venice in memory of a famous soldier who had lead military troops many times when Venice was at war. His name was Bartolomeo Colleoni, and he had died in 1475. Colleoni was admired by many people who thought he was a good man, as well as a brave soldier and great military leader. Colleoni left a message to say that he wanted a statue of himself in the main square of Venice, right opposite St Mark's Basilica. The town council would not allow this. The statue was put in another important square, near the Hospital of St Mark and the Church of two Roman soldier-saints, St Giovanni and St Paolo. 

When Verrocchio started making this statue, there had been only one big equestrian monument made in more than a thousand years. Donatello had made an equestrian statue of another soldier, who was nick-named Gattamelata ("the Smug Cat"). Verrocchio must have looked at Donatello's statue, which was in Padua and at the four ancient bronze horses that stood high on the front of St Mark's Basilica. Verrocchio decided to make his horse do something which the St Mark's horses do, but Donatello's horse does not do. The horses at St Marks all have one front hoof raised, so that they are perfectly balanced on only three legs. 

Verrocchio's horse looks as if it is moving forward quite fast. It is full of action. The figure of Colleoni is not sitting down in the saddle, he is standing in the stirups, as if he is looking out to spot the enemy. The horse's head turns one way, and the body and face of Colleoni turns the other way. Colleoni looks fierce, as if he is leading his troops into battle. The statue is very lively and very life-like. 

Verrocchio moved from Florence to Venice in 1488, to help with the casting of the bronze statue. But he died that year, and never saw his most famous work finished.

Falklands War

The Falklands War was a war between the United Kingdom and Argentina over the Falkland Islands in 1982. The Falkland Islands are 480 kilometres from Argentina in the southern Atlantic Ocean.

Argentina and the United Kingdom have both argued over the Falklands Islands since the 1800s. In the 1760s and 1770s, the British set up a town at Port Egmont, which nearly led to a war with Spain who had a town at Port Louis. Then Argentina became a separate country from Spain in 1817 and set up a colony on the islands in 1820. An American warship later destroyed this town, and the British took the islands again in 1833.

The British kept the islands until Argentinian Special Forces invaded on April 2, 1982 and took control of the island.

The United Nations Security Council asked Argentina to withdraw, and tried to end the crisis with diplomacy. After seven weeks, Argentina did not withdraw, so the United Kingdom sent their military to attack. After a short battle in the air and at sea, the British landed on May 21 and fought on land until Argentina's army surrendered on June 14.

The British captured about 11,400 soldiers, and killed almost 750. Almost half of these Argentinians deaths were when the warship ARA "General Belgrano" was sunk by the British submarine HMS "Conqueror". There were 256 British deaths.

<doc id="178821" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178821" title="Red Kangaroo">
Red Kangaroo

The Red Kangaroo ("Macropus rufus") is the largest kangaroo. The word "macropus" means "big foot" and "rufus" means red. It is the largest mammal in Australia, and the largest marsupial in the world. It lives in the arid open areas of Australia which covers much of the country. It is not found in the south, on the east coast, or in the northern rainforests. 

The Red Kangaroo is a very large kangaroo. The fur is short, red to brown in colour, fading to a pale colour below and on the legs. Females are smaller than males and are a blue-grey colour with a small amount of brown, pale grey below, although arid area females are coloured like males. The kangaroo has long, pointed ears and a squared-off nose. The kangaroo has two front legs with small claws. It has two strong back legs, which are used for jumping, and a strong tail which is often used for balance when standing upright. The tail is also used as a fifth leg when walking slowly.

The males can jump a distance of in one leap.

Males grow up to tall and weigh up to . Females are tall and weigh up to . The tails is about long. There are often reports of larger Red Kangaroos, with some males reaching about tall.

The Red Kangaroo is able to keep its body cool (36 °C, 96.8 °F) in a hot climate. Its fur acts to insulate the body and during the heat of the day the kangaroo will rest and stay in the shade. It also control its temperature by panting (breathing hard), sweating and licking its front legs.

The Red Kangaroo's range of vision is about 300° because of the position of its eyes. (A human's range of vision is about 180°).

The Red Kangaroo is nocturnal and crepuscular, and spends the day sleeping or resting in the shade. It is active in the cool of the evening and at dawn. It lives alone or in small groups called 'mobs'. Membership of these groups often changes, and males are not territorial. The largest males control most of the matings and chase off other males.

The Red Kangaroo eats grasses and other vegetation. It can go without water, as they are able to get enough moisture out of plants.

The Red Kangaroo breeds all year round. The gestation period is around 33 days. The females are also able to delay birth of their baby until their previous joey has left the pouch. The young joey leaves the pouch at around 235 days old, but will continue to suckle until it reaches 1 year of age.

When male kangaroos fight, they look like they are "boxing". They usually stand up on their back legs and attempt to push the other off balance by jabbing him or locking front legs. Using their tail to support their weight, they can also kick with their powerful back legs.

The Red Kangaroo is hunted in large numbers in Australia. In the year 2000, 1,173,242 animals were killed. In 2009 the government put a limit of 1,611,204 for the number of Red Kangaroos available for commercial use. The kangaroo industry is worth about AU$270 million each year, and employs over 4000 people.
The kangaroos provide meat for both humans and pet food. Kangaroo meat is very lean with only about 2% fat. Their skins are used for leather, and makes the lightest and strongest leather. Around the world, nearly all professional soccer players wear boots made from kangaroo leather.

Urolagnia

Urolagnia (also urophilia, undinism) is a sexual activity where people gain sexual pleasure from urine and/or urination. The term has origins in the Greek Language (from "ouron", urine, and "lagneia", lust). 

Those who enjoy urolagnia may enjoy urinating on other people, or being urinated on. The practice of drinking the urine is called urophagia, although this word also applies to non-sexual situations. People who practice urolagnia may participate in urolagnia as part of a domination and submission scene, though not all sexual activity involving urine is so. 

These activities are often described with the slang terms "golden showers", "water sports", or "piss play". Urolagnia is sometimes associated with omorashi, but omorashi is usually described in Western culture using terms such as "bladder desperation" or "panty wetting".

In New Zealand, publishing anything promoting or supporting urolagnia, whether in print or online, is an offence punishable by up to ten years in prison.

Rock it (game)

Rock it is a guitar game by Hasbro. It has four different games. A reflex game called Jam, a memory game called ((Rhythm)) Jam, a group game called Group Jam, and a freestyle called called Free Jam. This game also has a rock and a dance beat, and three volume controls. It has four controls. A strummer, a twister, and a slider where it can slide to the left and the right.

The game Jam is a reflex game similar to the game Bop It where there is a sound for each command. If the player makes a mistake or hesitate, the game is over and a ranking is given. The highest score is 300 points, that's 1 point for each command.

In Rhythm Jam, the player has to remember what the commands are. The maximum score is 400 points, that 4 points for each pattern.

In Group Jam, 2 or more players can play. It's similar to the pass it game in Bop it, where after 3-7 commands, the voice will say, "Who's next?".

This is where the user can do anything they want.

At the end of each game, the player is given a ranking. The lowest ranking is "That was wack!" and the best ranking is, "Woww! Yeah dog!"

Myelodysplastic syndrome

The Myelodysplastic syndrom is a group of diseases and conditions that affect how blood is made. These diseases were formerly known as preleukemia, mostly because sometimes they can lead to leukemia. Often, its name is shortened to MDS. 

Myelodysplastic syndromes affect the bone marrow stem cells. The production of blood does not rely on good stem cells, but ones that have been modified genetically. This means that the production of red blood cells, sometimes of white blood cells and blood platelets changed. The production becomes inefficient, or goes wrong altogether. Most of the time, this manifests in anemia - not having enough blood. Depending on the severity of the condition, it can also cause hemorrhages and infections with fever.

Most of the people who have these conditions are 60 years or older, but younger people can get it too, especially if they went through a form of chemotherapy. Most of the suffers die from the disease, usually after six to thirty months. The only known cure is a stem cell transplant. About a third of those suffering contract leukemia within a few months to a few years.

Bone marrow

Bone marrow is a type of tissue that can be found in hollow bones. In adults, the bone marrow in large bones produces new blood cells. About 4% of the weight of an adult human is bone marrow, that is about 2.6 kg.
There are two types of bone marrow: red marrow (consisting mainly of myeloid tissue) and yellow marrow (consisting mainly of fat cells). Red blood cells, platelets and most white blood cells arise in red marrow. Both types of bone marrow contain numerous blood vessels and capillaries.

At birth, all bone marrow is red. With age, more and more of it is converted to the yellow type. About half of adult bone marrow is red.[1] Red marrow is found mainly in the flat bones, such as the hip bone, breast bone, skull, ribs, vertebrae and shoulder blades, and in the cancellous ("spongy") material at the epiphyseal ends of the long bones such as the femur and humerus. Yellow marrow is found in the hollow interior of the middle portion of long bones.

In cases of severe blood periods, the body can convert yellow marrow back to red marrow to increase blood cell production.

Stem cell

Stem cells are cells of the body (somatic cells) which can divide and become differentiated. 

When an organism grows, stem cells specialize, and take specific functions. For instance, mature tissues like skin, muscle, blood, bone, liver, nerves, all have different types of cell. Because stem cells are not yet differentiated, they can change to become some kind of specialized cells. Organisms also use stem cells to replace damaged cells during lifetime.

Stem cells are found in most, if not all, plants and animals. They divide and differentiate into a range of cell types. Research in the stem cell field grew out of findings in the 1960s.

The two broad types of mammalian stem cells are: embryonic stem cells, and adult stem cells, which are found in adult tissues. In a developing embryo, stem cells can differentiate into "all" of the specialised embryonic tissues. In adult organisms, stem cells act as a repair system for the body, replenishing specialized cells, but also maintain the normal turnover of blood, skin, and intestinal tissues.

Stem cells can be grown in cell culture. In culture, they can be transformed into specialised cells, such as those of muscles or nerves. Highly plastic adult stem cells can be taken from a variety of sources, including umbilical cord blood and bone marrow. They are now used in medical therapies, and researchers expect that stem cells will be used in many future therapies.

Embryonic stem cells (ES cells) are stem cells taken from the inner cell mass of the early stage embryo known as a blastocyst. Human embryos reach the blastocyst stage 4-5 days after fertilization. At that time, they are made up of between 50 and 150 cells. 

The stem cells' state, and what the daughter cells turn into, is influenced by signals from other cells in the embryo.

Textual criticism

Textual criticism is the study of different copies of books or manuscripts. The purpose is to find the original, and see what changes were made to the later versions.

Textual criticism started with the study of the Bible, but now these techniques are used to study many texts.

The basic problem, as described by Paul Maas, is as follows:

The lack of autograph manuscripts applies to many cultures other than Greek and Roman. In such a situation, a key objective becomes the identification of the first "exemplar" before any split in the tradition. That exemplar is known as the "archetype". "If we succeed in establishing the text of [the archetype], the reconstruction of the original is considerably advanced".

The textual critic's ultimate objective is the production of a "critical edition". This contains a text most closely approximating the original, which is accompanied by a critical apparatus that presents:

San Francisco Symphony Orchestra

The San Francisco Symphony (SFS) is a world-famous orchestra based in San Francisco, California. The conductor today is Michael Tilson Thomas, who has been their main conductor (“musical director”) since 1995.

When the conductor Henry Hadley started the orchestra in 1911 they only had sixty musicians. They gave pop concerts as well as concerts of classical music. In 1915 Alfred Hertz became their conductor. He improved their playing and made several radio broadcasts in the late 1920s. Hertz retired in 1930 and was followed by Basil Cameron and Issay Dobrowen. During the Great Depression, the orchestra had hardly and money and they did not play during the 1934-35 season. Then the people of San Francisco managed to get funding for the orchestra so that they could carry on.

The famous French conductor Pierre Monteux was asked to come and get the orchestra back to a good standard. He was very successful and the orchestra were soon offered more recordings. In 1949, Monteux invited Arthur Fiedler to lead summer "pops" concerts in the Civic Auditorium. Fiedler worked with the orchestra until the mid 1970s.

When Monteux left the orchestra in 1952, several conductors led the orchestra, including Leopold Stokowski, Georg Solti, Erich Leinsdorf, Karl Münchinger, George Szell, Bruno Walter, Ferenc Fricsay, and William Steinberg. .

Two years later the young Spanish conductor Enrique Jordá became their music director. At first things went well. He had a lot of energy, and sometimes his baton flew out of his hand as he conducted. Gradually the orchestra became less happy with Jordá who did not seem to be able to control the orchestra and did not rehearse them properly. Eventually, after George Szell, the conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra, criticized him, the orchestra got rid of him.

In 1963, the Austrian conductor Josef Krips became music director. He was very strict and rehearsed them in great detail. He started a tradition of playing a special concert every New Year's Eve, "A Night in Old Vienna." with music by Johann Strauss and other 19th century Viennese composers. The Japanese Seiji Ozawa was their next conductor. He gave very exciting concerts which were always sold out. They made many recordings together. He sometimes conducted operas and ballets which were partly acted, and he used university choirs for choral works.

Ozawa was followed by Edo de Waart, the young Dutch conductor. He did not show off like Ozawa had done, but he kept the standard of the orchestra very high. He conducted the orchestra's very first performances in the Davies Symphony Hall. The orchestra used the huge new organ in the Hall for works such as Saint-Saëns' Third Symphony. In de Waart's final season, 1984-85, there were four sold-out performances of Mahler's hugh Eighth Symphony with the Symphony Chorus, the Masterworks Chorale, the San Francisco Boys Chorus, and the San Francisco Girls Chorus.

The orchestgra started to do world tours under their next conductor Herbert Blomstedt who improved the orchestra’s sound. He is still an honorary conductor (Conductor Laureate).

Michael Tilson Thomas became music director in 1995. He had conducted the London Symphony Orchestra and had guest conducted the SFSO in 1974. He made sure the orchestra played more American music as well as plenty of Russian music. The standard of orchestral playing continues to be excellent today.

Sturt National Park

Sturt National Park is a national park in north west New South Wales (Australia), 1059 km northwest of Sydney. The park is named after the explorer, Charles Sturt, who travelled through the area in 1845. The park was created in the 1970's from six large sheep and cattle stations (farms). These stations included Mount Wood, Olive Downs, Whitta Brinna, Mount King, Binerah Downs and Fort Grey.

The park is large, covering more than of arid area. The east of the Sturt National Park has flood plains, some trees and small rocky gorges and creek beds. Lake Pinnaroo, near Fort Grey, is a Ramsar listed wetland.

The central area of the park, near the old Olive Downs sheep station, has "jump-ups", flat topped mesas rising up to metres above the plains. In the far west of the National Park, the gibber (stone) plains are replaced by the red sand dunes of the Strezlecki Desert. 

The Mount Wood Station used to cover and had 86,000 sheep. It employed 100 people. The homestead buildings have been renovated and an outdoor farm museum has been started.

Beaker culture

The Bell-Beaker culture (often simply called Beaker culture, Beaker people or Beaker folk, German: Gockenbecherkultur, "Culture that used bell-shaped cups") is the name of a cultural phenomenon that occurred in large parts of Western Europe, roughly between 2800 BC and 2200 BC (in Great Britain until about 1900 BC). Today, it is unclear whether this can be seen as a culture.

Paul Reinecke was the first to use the word "Glockenbecher" (bell-shaped cup) in German, around 1900. Other historians from Italy and Tchechoslovakia had used similar terms before. 

Gordon Childe thought that the people were missionaries, who also had the knowledge how to make copper. They spread from the Iberian peninsula on the "edges" of Europe with the oceans. The typical items linked to the movement were prestige items reserved to the upper class, according to Steven Shennan. Christian Strahm talk about a "Glockenbecherphänomen" (bell-shaped cup phenomenon), to avoid the word "culture".
People of the movement were buried in a special way: Often stone chests were used. In the western part of the culture, burials in megalithic tombs and caves are common - the burial rites are often adapted to local customs. People where buried in an embryonic position:
This means that both looked east, when buried.

Today, little is known about the settlements used by the culture. The only places where settlements/remains of settlements that were done at approximately the same time were found is in Knowth in Ireland, and one in Switzerland. 

Another culture that might have influenced the Beaker culture is the Corded Ware culture, mainly found in Northern Europe.

<doc id="179237" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179237" title="Los Angeles Philharmonic">
Los Angeles Philharmonic

The Los Angeles Philharmonic (LA Phil, LAP, or LAPO) is an American orchestra based in Los Angeles, California, United States. They give concerts every year from October until June at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, and a summer season at the Hollywood Bowl from July to September. Their conductor is Gustavo Dudamel.

The orchestra are world famous, and well known for playing a lot of music written by modern composers.

The orchestra was started in 1919 by William Andrews Clark. He was a business man who had a lot of money and he paid the orchestra himself. They gave their first concert eleven days after their first rehearsal. Clark played the violin himself and sometimes played with the second violin section. Their conductor was Walter Henry Rothwell. After he died several other conductors led the orchestra, including Georg Schnéevoigt and Artur Rodziński.

The famous conductor Otto Klemperer led the orchestra in 1933. He was one of many German emigrants fleeing from Nazi Germany. He gave many new orchestral pieces their first performance, and introduced the audience to the music of Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg. The orchestra played well for him, but Klemperer had health problems and suffered from manic depression.

William Andrews Clark died without leaving the orchestra an endowment. A new orchestra called the Southern California Symphony Association was started to try to keep the concerts going. Then a businessman called Harvey Mudd offered to pay Klemperer’s salary, and the orchestra started to earn more money playing in the Hollywood Bowl.
so they managed to keep going during the Great Depression.

After the 1939 Klemperer left because of serious health problems. Four years later he was followed by Alfred Wallenstein. Wallenstein had been the principal cellist of the New York Philharmonic and had then been the youngest member of the Los Angeles Philharmonic when it was founded in 1919. Arturo Toscanini had encouraged him to become a conductor. He had conducted the LA Phil several times. During his years as conductor of the LAPhil Wallenstein recorded several concertos with famous soloists such as Jascha Heifetz. 

By the mid-1950s the wealthy business woman Dorothy Buffum Chandler was funding the orchestra. They were looking for a really good conductor to be their musical director. They had hoped to get Eduard van Beinum, but he suddenly died. Then Georg Solti agreed to come for three years. He was going to begin officially in 1962 but then he resigned because he had not been consulted when the orchestra had appointed Zubin Mehta as assistant conductor. So Zubin Mehta became musical director.

In 1969 Ernest Fleischmann became the manager of the orchestra. He had some new ideas, including starting the Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society and the Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group. Both these groups had musicians from the large symphony orchestra in them. It gave the musicians a change to play different sorts of music. Other orchestras in the world gradually copied this idea.

When Zubin Mehta left to go to the New York Philharmonic in 1978, Carlo Maria Giulini took over as Music Director. Giulini left when his wife became ill and went back to Italy. André Previn was the next conductor. He was a good conductor, but he had some arguments with Fleischmann and so he resigned in 1989 and Esa-Pekka Salonen took over. He has conducted every season since then.

At the beginning of Salonen's time with the orchestra they gave regular performances at the Salzburg Festival and they played for a production of the opera "Saint-François d'Assise" by Olivier Messiaen. Salonen later took the orchestra on many other tours of the United States, Europe, and Asia, and conducted regularly at the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland, the BBC Proms in London, in Cologne for a festival of Salonen's own works, and, in 1996, in Paris for a Stravinsky festival conducted by Salonen and Pierre Boulez. 
Today the orchestra play in the Walt Disney Concert Hall.

Salonen left the LAPhilharmonia in 2009. Their conductor is now Gustavo Dudamel.

Galápagos Islands

The Galápagos Islands ("Archipiélago de Colón" in Spanish) are a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean belonging to Ecuador. The islands are famous for having many native animals, including giant tortoises. These animals helped Charles Darwin make his theory of Natural Selection when he visited the islands in 1835.

The Galápagos Islands are on the equator, 973 km (604 miles) from Ecuador in South America. There are 19 islands with a total of 8,010 square km (3,093 sq. miles) of land. The islands were made from volcanoes, and volcanoes are still making the islands of Isabela and Fernandina today. The most recent volcanic eruption was Cerro Azul in May 2008 on Isabela Island.

In 2001, about 18,000 people lived in the Galápagos Islands. Most people have come from mainland Ecuador to live in the islands within recent years (about 3500 people lived on the islands in 1972). Most people are from the Mestizo ethnic group, which are the descendants of Spanish and Native American peoples.

People live on only 5 of the 19 islands of the Galápagos: Baltra, Floreana, Isabela, San Cristobal and Santa Cruz. Puerto Ayora is the biggest town, where about 10,000 people live. Puerto Ayora is on Santa Cruz Island. The second biggest town is Puerto Baquerizo Moreno on San Cristobal with about 5,600 people. Puerto Villamil is the town of Isabela Island, where about 2,000 people live.

Each year, about 60,000 tourists visit the Galápagos Islands.

The islands are one of the 24 provinces of Ecuador. The capital of the province is Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, a town with 5,600 people.

There are three cantons in the province. Each canton has a "seat", which is a town like a capital. All of the islands of the province are in one of the three cantons.

Nathaniel Hawthorne

Nathaniel Hawthorne (born Nathaniel Hathorne, July 4, 1804 – May 19, 1864) was an American novelist and short story writer. He was born in Salem, Massachusetts. One of the judges of the Salem Witch Trials was named John Hathorne. In order not to be taken as the same family as the judge, he later added a "w" to his name. John was the great-grandfather of Nathaniel, though. Until about 1830, Nathaniel published under the name "Hathorne". One of his best-known stories is The Scarlet Letter, published in 1850. 

Many of his works are set in New England, and have a Puritan viewpoint. His fiction works are considered to be part of the Romantic movement and, more specifically, dark romanticism. He often writes about how humanity is evil and sinful. His writings often have moral messages and deep psychological complexity. His published works include novels, short stories, and a biography of his friend Franklin Pierce.

Hemel Hempstead

Hemel Hempstead is a town in England. It is 25 miles north-west of London. The town is off the M1 motorway, 20 minutes drive from Luton Airport and 40 minutes from London itself.

The town began as an Anglo Saxon village where two river valleys met in the Chiltern Hills. The local area grew very good grain. By Tudor times, the village became a market where grain and straw were sold. The town also had many water mills to grind the grain. Local people also earned money by plaiting the straw to be made into hats.

From about 1800, the town changed as the Industrial revolution took place. It is on the shortest route between London and the Birmingham. As trade between these two cities increased, a canal and a railway were built that passed very close to the town. Some of its water mills were changed from grinding grain to places where paper was made by machine. Some of these grew into giant paper making factories.

After the Second World War, the government in London wanted to build many new homes for people who had had their homes destroyed by bombs in the war. It decided to build some new towns where houses could be built in an very good environment. Hemel Hempstead was chosen to be one of these towns. Many new districts were built during the 1950s and 1960s all around the old town of Hemel Hempstead. It grew into a middle size town of over 80,000 people.

Many new industries came to the town helped by money from the government and because it is where important motorways cross each other.

Hemel Hempstead became world famous for a brief time in 2005 when an oil depot in the town at Buncefield exploded. It caused a big toxic smoke cloud to cover all the surrounding areas. Millions of pounds in damage was done, but no one was killed.

Shock wave

A shock wave is when lots of energy comes from a very small spot. The shockwave can be so powerful that it can knock things over! Bombs create shockwaves. A shockwave happens because the energy pushes air really fast, and then the air can hit things. Bombs are made more dangerous because of shockwaves.

A Shockwave can move through any material. An earthquake is a shockwave travelling through the ground. Shockwaves are affected by the materials they travel through.

A sound wave is a collection of shockwaves. The frequency of a sound is how frequently those shockwaves hit your ear. The amplitude is the strength or size of the shockwaves.

<doc id="179402" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179402" title="Plastic Island">
Plastic Island

The Plastic Island formed because currents near the center of the Northern Pacific Ocean move around in a kind of circle, which catches and holds floating pieces of plastic. It has been called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

The "Plastic Island" actually has two areas, described as an eastern patch and a western patch, which are separated because of ocean currents. Scientists estimate that the size of the "plastic island" is approximately equal to the land area of the United States, but it could be as much as twice the size. Also, it is not really a floating island. It is more like a soup of plastic pieces floating in the ocean just below the surface. It is from California, between Hawaii and Japan.

Ships try to avoid this patch of garbage because it can get caught in their screws. Unfortunately, birds and other sea animals often eat the smaller pieces of plastic, thinking that they are food swimming in the ocean. The United Nations Environment Program estimates that the plastic soup causes the death of one million sea birds and 10,000 sea animals every year. Some micro-invertebrates have also been found to eat tiny pieces of plastic with similar results.

Since the plastics are organic compounds, they tend to absorb other organic compounds, such as pesticides. Scientists have discovered high levels of DDT and other organic compounds in this deadly plastic soup.

The pieces of plastic come from all over the world. Any country that has a shore or river, where such pieces blow or wash out to sea is a source. Scientists estimate that the United States and other industrial countries contribute less garbage to the plastic island due to modern garbage disposal; but such countries also produce and sell much of the plastic that becomes garbage for non-industrial countries. 

Changing winds and currents often cause parts of this plastic island to break away and send pieces of plastic toward the beaches and shorelines of Pacific Islands and the continents. It's considered a major problem for tourism, and because of the problems that it causes the island and ocean environments. For example, many birds, turtles, and other animals go to Pacific Islands to lay their eggs and raise their young. They can eat or get caught in the garbage.

This is a world wide environmental problem.

In April 2008, Richard Sundance Owen, and Steven Santos two building contractors and scuba dive instructor, started the Environmental Cleanup Coalition to solve the problem of the pollution in the North Pacific. They are working with other groups to find ways to safely remove plastic and organic compounds from the oceans. 

Project Kaisei is a project to study and clean up the garbage patch launched in March 2009. In August 2009 two ships from the project, the RV New Horizon and the Kaisei, went to research the patch and decide the possibility of a commercial scale collection and recycling operation.

Amazon Kindle

Amazon Kindle is a software and hardware platform for reading electronic books (e-books), developed by Amazon.com subsidiary Lab126, first launched in the United States on November 19, 2007. Three hardware devices, known as "Kindle", "Kindle 2," and "Kindle 3" support this platform.

The Kindles use an electronic paper display and download books and websites over Amazon Whispernet using the Sprint Nextel EVDO network. A Wireless network can also be used. Kindles can be used without a computer, and Whispernet is accessible without any fee. These devices also provide free internet access to Wikipedia. 

Upon the initial launch of the Kindle, Amazon's Kindle Store had more than 88,000 digital books available for download, with the number of books increasing. Amazon's first offering of Kindle sold out in five and a half hours and the device remained out of stock until late April 2008.

The Kindle retailed for $399; Amazon subsequently lowered the price to $359. Amazon does not sell the Kindle outside the United States as Whispernet only works in the U.S. Plans for a launch in the UK and other European countries are being delayed by problems with signing up suitable Wi-Fi operators. The CDMA technology in the Kindle does not allow for its use in the UK due to the lack of a CDMA network operator in the UK.

The internal memory of the Amazon Kindle can hold approximately 200 books without pictures, and the memory is expandable with a memory card. 

A reviewer from CNET expressed concern with the presentation of the device despite its comfortable design. The picture to the left displays a distinctly beige colored device. In point of fact, both Kindle versions are a matte bright white with all button labels and text colored gray. The Kindle 1 is the exact same color as the Kindle 2 pictured in the upper right-hand corner of this page.

On February 9, 2009, Amazon announced the Kindle 2, which became available for purchase on February 23, 2009 for the price of $359, and lowered on July 8, 2009 for $299. The new Kindle features improved battery life, 20 percent faster page-refreshing, a text-to-speech option to read the text out loud, and overall thickness reduced from 0.8 to 0.36 inches (9.1 millimetres). The Kindle 2 has 2 GB of internal memory. Amazon estimates that the Kindle 2 will hold about 1500 books. Unlike the original Kindle, Kindle 2 does not have a slot for memory cards. To promote the new Kindle, author Stephen King has made his new book named "UR" only available through Kindle.

According to an early review by website iFixIt, the new Kindle 2 features a 532 MHz 90 nm processor, 2GB main memory, and 1530 mAh lithium polymer battery.

The Kindle 3 comes in 2 models. A wi-fi and a 3G. The Wi-Fi can only download books over wireless internet. However the 3G Kindle can download books over Wi-Fi and 3g.

La Altagracia Province

La Altagracia is the easternmost province of the Dominican Republic. It was created on 1961 and its capital city is Higüey.

The region of the province was part of the El Seibo until 1944 when it was made part of the new province of La Romana. In 27 February 1961, the La Romana province was split in two provinces: La Romana and La Altagracia.

To the north and east of the province is the coast of the Atlantic Ocean and to the south is the Caribbean Sea. The province is bordered to the west by La Romana and El Seibo provinces.

The province is called La Altagracia (in English, "High Grace") because the "Basílica de Nuestra Señora de la Altagracia" (in English, "Our Lady of High Grace Church") is in the city of Higüey, capital city of the province.

La Altagracia has a total area of 3,010.34 km². It has 6.2% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the second (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province.

There are two municipalities and five municipal districts (M.D.) in the province. These are:

In 2002 (last national census), there were 63,879 people living in the La Altagracia province with 119,733 (60.5%) living in towns and cities. The population density was 60.5 persons/km².

There are some low mountains in the northern part of the province. Those mountains are part of the "Cordillera Oriental" ("Eastern mountain range"). Savannas are found everywhere in the province.

There are not many rivers in this province. The main river is the Yuma that flows from north to south, into the Caribbean Sea.

The climate of the province is a tropical climate, hot most of the year.

The most important economic activities in the province are farming (cattle and sugar cane) and tourism. The eastern coast of the province, in the region of Punta Cana and Bávaro, is the most important touristic centre of the country with many hotels along beaches with white sand. Bayahibe, in the southern coast, is also an important touristic centre.

Just Say No

"Just Say No" was an advertising campaign, part of the United States "War on Drugs", which was waged during the 1980s and early 1990s, to discourage kids from trying drugs by offering various ways of saying "no". Eventually, this also expanded the realm of "Just Say No" to violence, sex, and any other naughty things that young people might try. The slogan was created and championed by First Lady of the United States Nancy Reagan during her husband's presidency.

La Romana Province

La Romana is a province of the Dominican Republic. It is located in the southeastern part of the country. Its capital city has the same name, La Romana.

It was created on 1959. It was a municipality of the El Seibo province before being elevated to the category of province.

The La Romana province is in the southeast part of the country. It is bordered to the northwest by the El Seibo province, to the northeast and east by the La Altagracia province and to the west by the San Pedro de Macorís province. The Caribbean Sea is to the south.

The province was given the name of the capital city but soon was changed to La Altagracia. In 1961, the name of the province was again La Romana, and La Altagracia was used for a new province.

The province was created in 1944 with the name of La Romana, with two municipalities: La Romana (the capital city) and Higüey; before that date, it was part of the El Seibo province. But that same year, the name of the province was changed to La Altagracia. Its original name was given back to the province in 1961 when the new La Altagracia province was created.

The La Romana province is one of the smallest province of the country, with a total area of 653.95 km². It has only 1.3% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 30th (out of 31 provinces plus the National District) largest province.

There are three municipalities and two municipal districts in the province.

The municipalities and their municipal districts (M.D.) are:

In 2002 (last national census), there were 219,812 people living in the La Romana province, and 197,050 (89.7%) living in towns and cities; it is one of the few provinces of the country where most of the people lives in cities. The population density was 336.1 persons/km², one of the highest in the country.

There are only a few low hills in the province and almost all the land is flat. The most important rivers are:

The small islands of "Saona" and "Catalina" are part of the province.

There are several important industries in the province; the oldest and one of the most important is the production of sugar. There is also a very important "zona franca" ("free zone" where the industries do not pay taxes and all the production is sent to other countries).

Tourism is very important in the province, around the capital city and with many people going to the beaches in the Saona and Catalina islands.

Navel lint, also called belly button lint, belly button fluff or navel fluff, is an collection of fluffy fibres in one's navel. 

Many people find that, at the beginning and end of the day, a small lump of fluff has appeared in the navel cavity. People have wondered why this happens for many years. In 2001, Dr. Karl Kruszelnicki of the University of Sydney, Australia, did a survey to find out why this happens. This is what he found out:


Dr. Kruszelnicki was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for Interdisciplinary Research in 2002. The Ig Nobel Prize is given for "achievements that cannot or should not be repeated".

Austrian scientist Georg Steinhauser has also done research on the navel lint.

<doc id="179557" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179557" title="Viking Age">
Viking Age

The Viking Age was a period in Northern European and Scandinavian history from the eighth to eleventh centuries. Scandinavian Vikings, also called Norsemen, explored the oceans and rivers of Europe through trade and warfare. The Vikings also reached Iceland, Greenland, Newfoundland, and Anatolia. Some Vikings are believed to have settled at L'Anse aux Meadows, an archaeological site on the northernmost tip of the island of Newfoundland, Canada, at a place they called Vinland.

In England the Viking Age began dramatically on June 8, 793, when Norsemen destroyed the abbey on Lindisfarne. Monks were killed in the abbey, thrown into the sea to drown, or carried away as slaves along with the church's wealth. The Viking devastation of Northumbria's Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe. "Never before has such an atrocity been seen," declared the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin of York. More than any other single event, the attack on Lindisfarne cast a shadow on the perception of the Vikings for the next 1100 years. In the 1890s scholars outside Scandinavia began to rethink the achievements, artistry, technological skills and seamanship of the Vikings.

Until Victoria's reign in Britain, Vikings were portrayed as violent and bloodthirsty. The stories from medieval England had always portrayed them as 'wolves among sheep'. During the nineteenth century, public opinions changed. The first challenges to the many anti-Viking images in Britain emerged in the 17th century. Some scholarly works on the Viking Age became available to readers in Britain. Archaeologists began to dig up Britain's Viking past. Linguists started to work on identifying Viking-Age origins for rural idioms and proverbs. The new dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled the Victorians to study some of the Icelandic Sagas.

During the second half of the 18th century the Icelandic Sagas were still used as important historical sources, but the Viking Age was regarded as a barbaric and uncivilized period in the history of the Nordic countries. Until recently, what was known about the history of the Viking Age was based on the Icelandic Sagas, the history of the Danes written by Saxo Grammaticus, the Russian "Primary Chronicle" and "the War of the Irish with the Foreigners". Few scholars still accept these texts as reliable sources; historians nowadays rely more on archaeology and numismatics, which have helped people understand the period.

The Norsemen were explorers, colonizers and traders as well as plunderers. The Vikings from Norway explored the North Atlantic and settled Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Shetland and Orkney Islands, Caithness in Scotland, Greenland and (briefly) North America. The Vikings from Denmark raided ports and coastal towns along the coasts of Europe and Britain. The Vikings from Sweden pushed east, into areas that are now parts of Russia and Ukraine, establishing trade connections with the Middle East and beyond.

By the 9th century, a strong central authority was established in Jutland, and the Danes were looking beyond their own territory for land, trade and plunder. Norway had been settled over many centuries by Germanic peoples from Denmark and Sweden who made farming and fishing communities around its coasts and lakes. The mountains and fjords formed strong natural boundaries. The communities remained independent of each other, unlike the situation in Denmark which is lowland. By 800, some 30 small kingdoms existed in Norway. The sea was the easiest way of communicating between these Norwegian kingdoms and the outside world. In the eighth century Scandinavians began to build war ships and send them on raids. The Viking longships were capable of travel on the open seas but also had a very shallow "draft", meaning they could sail into shallower bays and farther up rivers than other ships of their time. This led to the term "Viking", which came from the Old Norse word "vīk" (meaning inlet or bay). A person who went on raids was said to go "viking".

It is unknown what triggered the Vikings' expansion and conquests. This era was at the same time as the Medieval Warm Period (800 – 1300) and stopped with the start of the Little Ice Age (about 1250 – 1850). The lack of pack-ice during their time may have allowed the Norsemen to go "a-viking" or "raiding". It is believed that the heathen Norsemen suffered from unequal trade practices by Christian merchants who were given preference through a Christian network of traders. A two-tiered system of pricing existed among merchants who secretly traded with the Norse heathens. Viking raids occurred both separately and together with regular trading expeditions. 

Historians also suggest that the Scandinavian population was too large for the peninsula and there were not enough crops to feed everyone. This led to a hunt for more land to feed the ever-growing Viking population. Internal conflicts, especially during the period of conquest and settlement that followed the early raids, caused the progressive centralisation of power into fewer hands. This meant that lower classes who did not want to be oppressed by greedy kings went in search of their own lands. Those who settled Iceland created Europe's first modern republic with a yearly assembly of elected officials called the "Althing".

The earliest date given for a Viking raid is 787 CE when, according to the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", a group of men from Norway sailed to Portland, in Dorset. There, a royal official mistook them for merchants. They killed him when he tried to lead them to the king's manor to pay a trading tax on their goods. The beginning of the Viking Age in the British Isles is, however, often given as 793. It was recorded in the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" that the Northmen raided the important island monastery of Lindisfarne:
""AD. 793. This year came dreadful fore-warnings over the land of the Northumbrians, terrifying the people most woefully: these were immense sheets of light rushing through the air, and whirlwinds, and fiery dragons flying across the firmament. These tremendous tokens were soon followed by a great famine: and not long after, on the sixth day before the ides of January in the same year, the harrowing inroads of heathen men made lamentable havoc in the church of God in Holy-island "(Lindisfarne)", by rapine and slaughter."" -"Anglo Saxon Chronicle"

In 794, according to the "Annals of Ulster", there was a serious attack on Lindisfarne's mother-house of Iona, which was followed in 795 by raids on the northern coast of Ireland. From bases there, the Norsemen attacked Iona again in 802, causing great slaughter amongst the "Céli Dé" Brethren, and burning the abbey to the ground.

The end of the Viking Age is traditionally marked in England by three major events: the failed invasion by Haraldr Harðráði, who was defeated by Saxon King Harold Godwinson in 1066 at the Battle of Stamford Bridge; in Ireland, the capture of Dublin by Strongbow and his Hiberno-Norman forces in 1171; and in Scotland by the defeat of King Hákon Hákonarson at the Battle of Largs in 1263. Harold Godwinson was subsequently defeated within a month by William, Duke of Normandy, who was another descendant of Vikings. Normandy had been acquired by "Normans" (Norsemen) in 911. Scotland took its present form when it regained territory from the Norse between the thirteenth and the fifteenth centuries.

Most Scandinavian historians and archaeologists give a different definition. Instead, the Viking age is said to have ended with the establishment of royal authority in the Scandinavian countries and the adoption of Christianity as the dominant religion. The date is usually put somewhere in the early 11th century in all three Scandinavian countries. The end of the Viking Age in Norway is marked by the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030. They proclaimed Norway as a Christian nation, and Norwegians could no longer be called Vikings.

The Kingdom of the Franks under Charlemagne was especially hard-hit by Viking raiders, who could sail down the Seine without much difficulty. Near the end of Charlemagne's reign and throughout the reigns of his sons and grandsons, a string of Viking raids began, leading to a Scandinavian conquest and settlement of the region now known as Normandy. 

In 911, French King Charles the Simple made an agreement with the Viking warleader Rollo, a chieftain of either Norwegian or Danish origin. Charles gave Rollo the title of duke and granted him possession of Normandy. In return, Rollo swore fealty to Charles, converted to Christianity, and swore to defend the northern region of France against raids by other Viking groups. Several generations later, the Norman descendants of these Viking settlers identified themselves as French and brought the French language and their variant of French culture to England in 1066. With the Norman Conquest, they became the ruling aristocracy of Anglo-Saxon England, leading to the change from Old English to Middle English language.

At the start of the Viking age, the Vikings adhered to the Norse religion and system of beliefs. They believed in a of gods and goddesses, as well as "Valhalla", a heaven for warriors. The lower class of society would go to a place called "hel", similar to life on earth. According to Viking beliefs, Viking chieftains would please their war-gods by their bravery, and would become "worth-ship"; that is, the chieftain would earn a "burial at sea". They also performed land burials which often still included a ship, treasure, weapons, tools, clothing and even slaves and women buried alive with the dead chieftain, for his journey to Valhalla and adventure in the after-life. Poets composed sagas about the exploits of these chieftains, keeping their memories alive. 

Freyr and his sister Freya were fertility gods. They made sure that people had many children and that the land produced plenty of crops. Some farmers even called their fields after Freyr, in the hope that this would ensure a good harvest. Toward the end of the Viking Age, more and more Scandinavians were converted to Christianity, often by force. The introduction of Christianity did not immediately end Viking voyages, but it may have been a factor that helped the Viking Age to an end.

Some of the most important trading ports during the period include both existing and ancient cities such as Jelling (Denmark), Ribe (Denmark), Roskilde (Denmark), Hedeby (Denmark, now Germany), Aarhus (Denmark), Vineta (Pomerania), Truso (Poland), Kaupang (Norway), Birka (Sweden), Bordeaux (France), Jorvik (England), Dublin (Ireland) and Aldeigjuborg (Russia).

Claret

Claret is a type of European red wine.

The standard style of Bordeaux wine has not always been deep red. It used to be more of a rosé, which is why its name is based on the French word "clairet", meaning pale. The Plantagenet kingdom, covering England and a lot of France from 1152 to 1453, supported wine trade between the regions. As the taste for "clairet" developed in England "claret" was adopted to describe it.

In the Late Middle Ages, a claret was a spiced wine-based drink produced by pouring wine, usually a red, over a bag containing a mix of spices. It was similar, and often the same, to hypocras. Spices that were specific to medieval clarets include anise, caraway, cardamom, cinnamon and fennel. The term now more often applies to unspiced red Bordeaux wine.

The meaning of "claret" has changed over time, and now means a dry, dark red Bordeaux wine.

However, the chances of a monkey actually typing a text, like Shakespeare's "Hamlet", are very small.

María Trinidad Sánchez is a province of the Dominican Republic. It is located in the northeastern part of the country, along the Atlantic coast. Its capital city is Nagua.

It was created on 1958. It was a municipality of the Samaná province before being elevated to the category of province.

María Trinidad Sánchez is in the northeast of the country. The province has the Samaná province to the southeast, the Duarte province to the south and west and the Espaillat province to the northwest. The Atlantic Ocean is to the north and east of the province.

"María Trinidad Sánchez" was a sister of Francisco del Rosario Sánchez, one of the founder of the country. She helped the Dominican soldiers during the first days of the independence from Haiti. She was killed on 27 February 1845 by orders of the first Dominican president, Pedro Santana.

The territory of the province was part of the Duarte province and then it was made a municipality of the Samaná province. In 1958, it was made a province with the name "Julia Molina" after the mother of the dictator Rafael Trujillo but in 1961, after Trujillo's death, the province was given the present name.

María Trinidad Sánchez has a total area of 1,271.71 km². It has 2.6% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 18th (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province.

There are four municipalities in the province and six municipal districts (similar to municipalities but depending of a municipality). The municipalities and municipal districts (M.D.) are:

In 2002 (last national census), there were 135,727 people living in the María Trinidad Sánchez province, and 61,238 (45.12%) living in towns and cities. The population density was 106.7 persons/km².

The "Cordillera Septentrional" (in English, "Northern mountain range") is found in the southern part of the province, going from the northwest to the southeast. The mountains here are not very high, and the mountain range ends in the southeastern part of the province, in a large swamp called "Gran Estero" close to the Samaná province.

Because the mountain range is close to the sea, the rivers are short.

The main economic activities in the province are farming and fishing. In some partes of the province, mainly in the northern parte (Río San Juan and Cabrera), tourism is an important activity because there are many beautiful beaches.

San Cristóbal Province

San Cristóbal is a province of the Dominican Republic. It is located along the south coast of the country. Its capital city has the same name, San Cristóbal.

It was created on 1932. It was a municipality of the old Santo Domingo (now Distrito Nacional) province before being elevated to the category of province.

The San Cristóbal province is in the south part of the country. It is bordered to the northwest by the Monseñor Nouel province, to the northeast by the Monte Plata province, to the east by the Santo Domingo province and to the west by the Peravia and San José de Ocoa province. The Caribbean Sea is to the south.

The province has the name of the capital city, San Cristóbal, but it was created with the name Trujillo, after the dictator Rafael Trujillo who was born in that city.

The San Cristóbal province has a total area of 1,265.77 km². It has 2.6% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 19th (out of 31 provinces plus the National District) largest province.

There are eight municipalities and six municipal districts in the province.

The municipalities and their municipal districts (M.D.) are:

In 2002 (last national census), there were 532,880 people living in the San Cristóbal province, and 273,018 (51.2%) living in towns and cities. The population density was 421.0 persons/km², one of the highest in the country. Most of the people lives in the south half of the province.

With a Wikipedia of this size (>58,000 articles), it doesn't hurt to have a few more admins. I've been a user on Simple English Wikipedia for some time now and have over 1200 edits. These edits include: article development, reverting vandalism, welcoming and warning users (appropriately), contributing to community discussions at ST, RfA, RfD, etc. I've also made a few VIP reports, made at least a hundred QD noms, and contributed to PGA/PVGA. I helped out with the Spoken Articles project and am currently working on migrating Twinkle to this wiki. 

While users may disagree with whether one's past on other wikis is important, I think it does weigh in at least partially. On the English Wikipedia I have more than 3700 edits over the past several years (as well as another 800 on an account I abandoned for privacy reasons). On both of these accounts, I have never been blocked from editing. Furthermore, I did a lot of CSD work and contributed many Third Opinions, which gave me quite a bit of experience in dispute resolution. 

My immediate goals are to continue to develop Twinkle as a tool that is useful for both users and admins (something that requires me to have admin privileges). Further, I'll begin to use the tools to take appropriate actions to prevent damage to this wiki, and continue to clean up test edits and vandalism as I've done before. What I love about this wiki is that, despite my desire to contribute to so many different projects, the users I see are usually the same group of people. I hope in my time here, I've been able to gain the trust of this community. 

I would like to co-nom EhJJ because he has proved himself to be 1) a good mainspace editor, b) a calm mind in dealing with other editors, c) a mature and rational editor in every edit that he has made to seWP. I've never known him to make a mistake and he takes an active part in community discussion on ST, and AN. EhJJ, also has taken an active part in IRC (not a big thing for me, but shows he's interested in an "active" role at seWP). I've got no reservations whatsoever in nominating EhJJ to be an admin. [I do admit that some of my respect for EhJJ is due to his being a colleague in the form of a medical student, but this is a minor part). :) 03:42, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

Treaty of Nantes

The Treaty of Nantes (also called the Edict of Nantes or Edict of Nantz) allowed for freedom of religion in France. It was made official for the first time on April 13, 1598. King Louis XIV revoked the Treaty of Nantes and made Catholicism the religion of France in 1629. This made many Huguenots (French Protestant) workers leave.

Louis XIV did not like the Edict of Nantes. Being an ruler, Louis thought that there should be one king, one nation, and one church only - and that church had to be the Roman Catholic Church. The king let Roman Catholics Huguenots even after the Edict. He hoped the Huguenots would become Roman Catholics. Finally, in 1685 King Louis withdrew the Edict of Nantes. 

The government declared that no one could believe in any religion except Roman Catholicism. Anyone joining in a Protestant service could die. Because of this, many Huguenots died for their faith. Some, though, gave up and became Roman Catholics. Others, refusing to stop being Protestants, ran away from France.

Louis XIV was horrified when he lost the Huguenots. They were among the most skilled workers in France. Many bankers, weavers, and merchants were Huguenots. Louis XIV ordered that France's borders be closed, and said that nobody could leave the country without his permission. However, Protestants still found ways to escape. Some hid in barrels on ships sailing away from France. Others disguised themselves as peasants and escaped. All together, probably more than two hundred thousand Huguenots ran away. 

Protestant countries in Europe were glad to have such hard-working subjects: over a third of the Huguenots went to the Netherlands. From there many of them went to the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope. Many went to England, and from there to America, especially Virginia and the Carolinas.

These immigrants were very valuable to their new home countries. They were hard working, obedient, and talented. They also brought many secrets of French manufacturing with them : for example, they introduced silk production to the rest of Europe.

Cross product

The Cross Product is a mathematical operation which can be done between two vectors. After performing the Cross Product, a new vector is formed. The cross product of two vectors is always perpendicular to both of the vectors which were "crossed". This means that the cross product must always be used in 3-Dimensional space.

Being a vector operation, the Cross Product is extremely important in all sorts of sciences (particularly physics), engineering, and mathematics. One important example of the Cross Product is in torque or moment.

Like any mathematical operation, the Cross Product can be done in a straightforward way.

For a two-dimensional Cross Product:
If
formula_1
and
formula_2
then
formula_3

or

formula_4
and
formula_5

formula_6 is just a symbol which says that our new vector is pointing up (in the z-direction). If you "cross" two vectors which are both in the x-y plane, the product will always be perpendicular to both vectors, and if both vectors are in the x-y plane, the only way for it to be perpendicular to both is to be in the z direction. If the value of formula_7 is positive, then it points OUT of the page; if its value is negative, then it points INTO the page.

Knowth is the name given to a number of passage graves, in the Boyne valley in Ireland. It consists of a bigger tumulus with two passages, and of 20 smaller ones. Of the smaller graves, 17 remain, 3 have been destroyed. Knowth is approximately 1 km west of Newgrange. It is probably older than Newgrange, which has been dated to about 3.150 BCE, but not as old as Dowth. The main tumulus is one of the biggest to be found in Ireland.

Kill switch

A kill switch, sometimes called an emergency stop, is a part of a user interface. User interfaces allow people to operate machines. The kill switch is there for security. Its purpose is to switch off the machine as quickly as possible, or to bring it into a state where it can no longer do harm. It is used in an emergency. In many ways, switching off the machine in an emergency is different from switching it off normally, as it has to avoid injury or harm at all costs.

I'm suggesting this as it looks promising, and I think it can be done in the two weeks available. We have at least 2 editors which might have this right up their street, so I thought (well... Epty thought) that we'd give it a shot! Comments please! 19:42, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

I might be the only one with this problem in this article. But the section "The problem with images of God" seems to (for a lack of a better term) contradict the Bible in some parts. Which since it is about something in the bible I think it should describe it accurately. My point is it says "Jesus in his human form" but the fact remains it says in the bible that God made us in his own likeness which mean he has human features as does Jesus.--     19:49, 30 April 2009 (UTC)
(<-) My intent was not to silence discussion: CM16 - If you think the passage does not accurately reflect the situation, please change it; but keep in mind that we also talk about Jewish and Muslim understandings.

(<-) Added the two more common arguments (can the fetus feel pain, and the breast cancer hypothesis). Both probably need simplifying. Did not add the relation to crime (as there is no link), or the Mexico City policy (it is specific to the US, and not directly related to abortion). I invite all of you to collaborate on this article. The EnWP article is about twice the size of ours, so if you feel something is missing, do not be afraid to bring it over, but remember to keep the refs, and to simplify it so our audience can understand it. -- () 10:04, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

Comment There are problems here, and it's down to the use of Simple English. Edits such as this try to simplify the text, yet they add a POV. The arguments about fetus v unborn child on EN go on for archive after archive. That change is more than just simplification, sadly. () 13:39, 3 May 2009 (UTC)

I think it's worth another go for GA. I have spent some time simplifying the Charta which was the main concern last time.

<doc id="179857" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179857" title="Trial by ordeal">
Trial by ordeal

Trial by ordeal is a way to decide if someone is guilty or innocent of a crime. This was usually done by causing the accused person to do a task that was painful. If that task was completed without injury or if the injuries healed fast, this was usually taken as a "sign of God", which meant that the accused was innocent. People believed that God would not allow the innocent to be harmed. He would therefore help them by doing a miracle. The practice has been shown to exist in polytheistic cultures as far back as the Code of Hammurabi and the Code of Ur-Nammu, and in animist tribal societies, such as the trial by ingestion of "red water" (calabar bean) in Sierra Leone. There the intended effect is magical rather than invocation of a deity's justice.

In pre-modern society, the ordeal typically was done together with the oath and witness accounts as the central means by which to reach a verdict. Indeed, the term "ordeal" itself, Old English "ordǣl", has the meaning of "judgment, verdict" (German "Urteil", Dutch "oordeel"), from Proto-Germanic "*uzdailjam" "that which is dealt out". 

In Europe, ordeals commonly required an accused person to test himself or herself against fire or water. How this was done in detail, varied, and was different at different places and times. In England, ordeals were common under both the Anglo-Saxons and the Normans. Fire was the element typically used to test noble defendants, while water was more commonly used by lesser folk. 

Priestly cooperation in trials by fire and water was forbidden by Pope Innocent III at the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, and replaced by compurgation. Trials by ordeal became more rare over the Late Middle Ages, often replaced by confessions extracted under torture, but the practice was discontinued only in the 16th century. Johannes Hartlieb in 1456 reports a popular superstition on how to identify a thief by an ordeal by ingestion practiced privately without judicial sanction.

Vienna Philharmonic

The Vienna Philharmonic (in German: die Wiener Philharmoniker) is an orchestra based in Vienna, Austria. It is thought of as one of the greatest orchestras in the world.

The orchestra play in a concert hall called the Musikverein. Before becoming a member of the Vienna Philharmonic the musicians have to work for at least three years in the opera house (the Vienna State Opera). Then they are allowed to try to become a member of the Vienna Philharmonic.

The orchestra started in 1842, when Otto Nicolai formed the "Philharmonische Academie". The members of this orchestra made all the decisions about how the orchestra should be organized, and the orchestra still works in this way today.

When Nicolai left in 1847, the orchestra nearly came to an end. They did not play very much until 1860, when Karl Anton Eckert joined as conductor. Since then, the orchestra has given concerts all the time.

From 1875 to 1898 Hans Richter was principal conductor, except for the season 1882-1883 when he had an argument with the orchestral committee. During the time Richter was conductor the orchestra gave the first performances of several very famous works, including Symphonies no 2 and 3 by Brahms and Symphony no 8 by Anton Bruckner.

Gustav Mahler was their conductor from 1898 to 1901. During this time the orchestra played abroad for the first time. They played at the 1900 Paris World Exposition. The next conductors of the orchestra were Felix Weingartner, Wilhelm Furtwängler and Clemens Krauss.
Since 1933, the orchestra has not had one main conductor, but instead it has many guest conductors who have stayed for short periods. These have included a great many of the world's best known conductors, including Richard Strauss, Arturo Toscanini, Hans Knappertsbusch, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Karl Böhm, John Barbirolli, Herbert von Karajan, Carlo Maria Giulini, Georg Solti, Erich Kleiber, James Levine, Zubin Mehta, Carlos Kleiber, Leonard Bernstein, Claudio Abbado, Riccardo Muti, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Pierre Boulez, Lorin Maazel, Mariss Jansons, Daniel Barenboim and Valery Gergiev. Three conductors, however, gave many concerts with the orchestra during the period after World War II: Karajan and Böhm, who were made honorary conductors, and Bernstein, who was made an honorary member of the orchestra.

Since 1941 the orchestra has played the New Year's Day concert every January 1, in their concert hall Musikverein. The concert is dedicated to the music of the Strauss family composers, especially Johann Strauss II. The concert is watched on television by people all over the world.

In recent years the orchestra has been criticised because they did not allow women to become full members of the orchestra. This is now gradually starting to change. They were also criticised for racism because they only took people who were white. In 2001 they appointed a violinist who was half-Asian.

Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra

The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra (in German: Gewandhausorchester Leipzig or just Gewandhausorchester) is a famous German orchestra based in Leipzig, Germany. It is named after the concert hall in which it is based, the Gewandhaus (pronounce: “Ge-VUNT-house”). The word “Gewandhaus” means "Textiles Hall". It is a hall that originally was used for people to buy and sell textiles.

The beginnings of the orchestra go back to 1743, when a society called the "Grosses Concert" began performing in private homes. In 1744 the "Grosses Concert" moved its concerts to the "Three Swans" Tavern. Their concerts continued there for 36 years. Gradually more and more people started to complain about the noise and the behaviour in the tavern, so in 1780 the mayor and city council of Leipzig offered to let the orchestra use part of the Gewandhaus, the building where the merchants were selling textiles. The orchestra gave its first concert in the Gewandhaus in 1781. It is the oldest orchestra in Germany, apart from private orchestras who belonged to rich people.

In 1835 the great composer Felix Mendelssohn became the orchestra's main conductor (music director). He was called the "Gewandhauskapellmeister". He kept this position, apart from one year, until his death in 1847. In 1885, the orchestra moved into a new hall which was given the same name. This was destroyed by bombing in World War II in 1944. The present Gewandhaus is the third building with the name. It was opened in 1981.

The orchestra gives concerts in Leipzig and all over the world, and makes many recordings. They also play at the Thomaskirche, the church where Johann Sebastian Bach used to work, and as the official opera orchestra of the Leipzig Opera.

Later principal conductors included Arthur Nikisch, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Bruno Walter, and Václav Neumann. From 1970 to 1996, Kurt Masur was Gewandhauskapellmeister. From 1998 to 2005 their conductor was Herbert Blomstedt. 

In 2005, Riccardo Chailly took over as both Gewandhauskapellmeister and music director of the Leipzig Opera. They have released recordings on the Decca label of Felix Mendelssohn, Johannes Brahms, and the Robert Schumann symphonies in the re-orchestrations by Gustav Mahler.

Troll (Internet)

An Internet troll, or simply troll, is someone who tries to harass by posting messages that tend to excite strong emotion in an online community. This is to get a reaction from other online users, or to cause problems. Sometimes trolling can get a user banned as it can be disruptive. Some users do it to be humorous when they know others will be angry. The best solution is to ignore trolls and to not give them the attention they want. This has become known as "don't feed the trolls". 

On websites such as Encyclopedia Dramatica where trolling is welcomed, users can troll without fear of being banned.

The Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra is an orchestra based in Saint Petersburg in Russia. It is the oldest orchestra in Russia. It has had several changes of name because of the way that Russia has often changed.

The orchestra started in 1882. It was then called the "Imperial Music Choir". It was the orchestra that belonged to the emperor and it played privately for the court of Alexander III of Russia. 

By the 1900s it had started to give public performances. Richard Strauss conducted the orchestra in 1912.

After the Russian Revolution the country no longer had a tsar. The town of Saint Petersburg changed its name to Petrograd, so the orchestra's name changed to "State Philharmonic Orchestra of Petrograd". In the 1920s the orchestra began to get money from the state. It was an excellent orchestra and was famous abroad. Guest conductors who conducted the orchestra included Bruno Walter, Ernest Ansermet and Hans Knappertsbusch at this time. Around this time the orchestra changed its name to Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra, because the city had changed its name again, this time to "Leningrad".

Evgeny Mravinsky conducted the orchestra for 50 years. They were not allowed to travel abroad, so they were only known outside Russia (the USSR) by their gramophone recordings. Symphony no 8 by Shostakovich was one famous work of which they gave the first performance.

By 1991 Leningrad had changed its name again to Saint Petersburg, so the orchestra was renamed Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra. It is an internationally well-known orchestra. Their conductor today is Yuri Temirkanov.

In Hebrew it is written: התזמורת הפילהרמונית הישראלית, pronounced: "ha-Tizmoret ha-Filharmonit ha-Yisre'elit". It was started in 1936 by the violinist Bronisław Huberman when it was known as the Palestine Orchestra. At this time the Nazis were in power in Germany and Jews were being persecuted. Many European orchestras were getting rid of their Jewish musicians. The orchestra gave their first concert in Tel Aviv on 26 December 1936, and was conducted by Arturo Toscanini.

The orchestra tours to many parts of the world. In 1971 they visited Germany. Some of the world's greatest conductors have conducted the orchestra. Leonard Bernstein and Zubin Mehta in particular have had a close relationship with them. They did not have a main conductor until 1977 when Mehta was made Music Director. 

The IPO have made many recordings with Mehta, and also with Bernstein.

After 1938 the orchestra have refused to play the music of Richard Wagner because he was anti-Jewish.

Until 1977 the orchestra had no Music Directors. The conductors most closely associated with the orchestra were called "musical advisors".

Mouthpiece (woodwind)

The mouthpiece of a woodwind instrument is the part which the player blows into.

On single-reed instruments like a clarinet or saxophone the mouthpiece is shaped like a wedge. The reed is placed near the player's bottom lip. This area is called the "table". When the player blows, the reed vibrates. This is then made louder by the instrument.

The shape of the inside of the mouthpiece can change the sound very much. The sound made by a mouthpiece that is large and round will be very different from the sound made by a mouthpiece that is small and square.

The space between the end of the reed and the end of the mouthpiece is called the "tip opening".

The "facing" (or "lay") is the part of the reed that starts to curve around the end of the mouthpiece. The length of the facing can change the response of the instrument.

The ligature is what holds the reed onto the mouthpiece. Anything that can hold the reed onto the mouthpiece can be called a ligature. Most ligatures are made from metal or plastic. Some people like to use ordinary string to hold the reed onto the mouthpiece.

The orchestra was started in 1978. Some of the greatest conductors have worked with the EUYO, including Herbert von Karajan, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Claudio Abbado.

Wiener schnitzel

Wiener Schnitzel ("Viennese Schnitzel" in German, where "Schnitzel" means a without bones) is a traditional Austrian dish and is a popular part of Viennese and Austrian cuisine, consisting of a thin slice of veal coated in breadcrumbs and fried. 
In Austria the dish is traditionally served with a lemon slice, lingonberry jam and either potato salad or potatoes with parsley and butter. While the traditional Wiener Schnitzel is made of veal, it is now sometimes made of pork, though in that case it is often called "Schnitzel Wiener Art" (Germany) or "Wiener Schnitzel vom Schwein" (Austria) to differentiate it from the original. In Austria, the term "Wiener Schnitzel" is protected by law, and any schnitzel called by that name has to be made from veal.
The dish may have originated in Milan, northern Italy, as "cotoletta alla milanese", and may have appeared in Vienna during the 15th or 16th century. According to another theory, it was introduced in 1857 by Field Marshal Radetzky, who spent much of his life in Milan. The term "Wiener Schnitzel" itself dates to at least 1862.

Schnitzel is often mistaken for sausage in the modern American society. What many Americans do not realize about schnitzel is that its part of the melting pot of American cultures. For example, German immigrants to Texas in th 1800s combined schnitzel recipes to make chicken fried steak-popular in the southwest U.S.A.. Chicken tenders are similar to Schnitzel as well.

Even Israel has its own type of schnitzel. After WWII, many Jews fled anti-Semitism to form their own nation in the land of their ancestors, Israel. Many European "Ashkenazi Jews" brought back German recipes to their country and culture. Areas with large German populations like Argentina also carry schnitzel.

Even though schnitzel is often served as a platter, it comes in sandwiches as well. If its a platter it usually comes with "Spatezel"-German egg noodles.

Gel

A gel is a semi-solid substance material which usually wobbles.

By weight, gels are mostly liquid. But gels also behave like solids. They have a three-dimensional cross-linked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinks in the fluid that give a gel its structure. 

As colloids, gels are a dispersion of molecules of a liquid within a solid. In a gel, the solid is the continuous phase; the liquid is the discontinuous phase.

Examples: Jellies, agar, contact lenses, organic slime.

Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa

Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa was founded by Father Junipero Serra in 1772. It is located on the Central Coast of California, halfway between Santa Barbara and Monterey. It was named after Saint Louis of Anjou, the bishop of Toulouse. It was the fifth of twenty-one missions in California. Mission San Luis Obispo has beautiful architectural features, mission life, and historical events. 
Mission San Luis Obispo is different from all the other missions because it is one of the smallest and has such a unique design. Some reasons it is called unique is because it has both belfry (a bell tower) and a vestibule, which is an entrance hall between the outer door and the interior of a building. These structures can't be found on any of the other California missions. The main nave (the long entrance part of the church) is long and narrow. At San Luis Obispo there is a secondary nave that is the same size and at the right of the altar. This is the only "L"-shaped mission church in any of the California missions. Porches around the courtyard have round pillars with square opening, unlike the arches of other missions. San Luis Obispo is painted white and is surrounded by gardens, wine vineyards, and a fountain.

Mission life was hard for the California Indians because they had to work hard and study Catholicism. Women had to cook, sew, garden, and make candles and soap. Men had to farm and care for the animals while the older people had to fish and make arrows. The children attended church every day to study Catholicism. When their studies were done they would work hard helping their families. The Spanish introduced the gun to the Chumash. The Chumash were grateful for the Spaniard guns as they depended on them for hunting bears for food. The Chumash helped these Spaniards build the missions and take care of it and its surroundings.

Other hostile Indians attacked San Luis Obispo on three separate occasions before 1774. During the attack, the thatched roofs of the mission buildings were set afire by blazing arrows. In May 1807, the mission was designated as one of six in which the California priests could make their annual retreats for spiritual exercises. Following Mexico's war against Spain in 1810, all the California missions were forced to contribute food and clothing to the army. 
In 1834, it was destroyed in an earthquake but later was rebuilt with stone.

Mission San Luis Obispo deTolosa is one of the first missions founded in California. The mission building has an unusual design, with both belfry and vestibule, that can’t be found on other missions. Mission life was hard for the Indians because they had to study Catholicism and work hard doing their daily chores. The mission was attacked by hostile Indians, who burned the thatched roofs. The mission was finally destroyed by earthquake but is one of the missions that survived the 1906 earthquake with the least amount of damage and was later rebuilt with stone. Mission San Luis Obispo is more than a couple hundred years old. Today, the mission serves as a parish church and a museum.

The purpose of the "resolved" tag is to give a visual hint to readers of talk page items, making it easier to ignore already-resolved issues. Also, it is hoped that the existence of such a tag will encourage the resolution of items on a talk page.

This template is to show an item on a talk page has been resolved and there is no dispute in anyone's mind about the outcome. That is, the initial comment or request has been filled, a reply to that effect has been added, and there are no disputed items or issues left to be resolved, and (if required) the article (or other page type) has been updated.

The "resolved" tag is not final and does not close a conversation. If new issues arise, or the item is not fully resolved, please remove the tag. Thus, the tag also helps clarify situations that might otherwise be ignored because some users thought the issue was resolved, when it was not.

This tag can be (and is) also used in admin processes to note that an action item reported to a notice board has been dealt with, and can further be of help on user talk pages to sort messages for archival from those to be retained for continued discussion or followup action.

Hello people, I believe this is my sixth article for Simple News! This time I going to talk about many things. "(Note: a spoken version of this article is also available)"

First of all, P(V)GA processes still need help. We need help nominating the articles, finding what needs to be improved, improving the articles, and voting. Remember, they are our best articles, and the more there are, the better it is for our wiki.

Secondly I'd like to announce was revived and could use a little help. We need people to find hooks, verify these hooks (with references), checking the articles the hooks are in and aprove or decline these hooks. This project wasn't revived for nothing, and these hooks are displayed on the main page. We don't want them to be bad, nor do we want to find any misinformation in the articles they promote. A little help there would also be welcommed.

Next, I'd like to Speak about Simple News its self. It also needs help. Why not write an article (like myself and others), make a suggestion, or even have your own section on Simple News by suggesting it . 

Finally, a word about . I broke my microphone and was not able to record any. However, I have bought a new one, and will be making more shortly. Please request articles you'd like a spoken version of on the page, as it's always nicer making/reading an article for someone, rather than for yourself. 

Also, I'd quickly like to thank everyone who participated in my rfa. I decided not to spam every single one of you, and left a message at instead. Also a big thanks to for nominating me, and for telling that it was the right time to go for it. 

Thanks for reading, more News in the next edition! </font face> </font face> 07:52, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

Tambourine

The tambourine is a well-known percussion instrument. It is often used in large orchestras but can also be used in marching bands and other music groups.

The tambourine looks like a small hand-held drum, but in addition to the skin (drumhead) which can be hit in various ways by the other hand or fingers, there are also small pairs of jingles - like tiny cymbals - which are fixed in slots around the frame. This is the usual kind used in orchestras. However, tambourines come in many shapes and forms. Some are made without a skin, particularly for use in schools. They are also found in various forms in many parts of the world. The tambourine came to Europe through the Arabs who brought it to Italy and Spain. They can be used in classical music as well as in pop music and rock music.

The tambourine is usually held in the hand. The jingles can be made to sound by hitting the frame of the instrument with the other hand, or by shaking the instrument in various ways. Very often the player will hold the instrument high in the air. This not only looks good, but it can also be heard well. The other hand can tap rhythms on the skin which makes it sound like a drum as well as making the jingles sound. It can be hit by the knuckles, or with the finger tips, or the flat of the hand or the back of the hand. It can also be hit against the side of the leg. A good player with a good tambourine can sometimes create a nice effect with a "thumb roll". This is done by making the tip of the thumb slightly wet and then moving it fast along the edge of the skin so that the thumb bounces very fast.

It is also possible to put the instrument, with the head up, on the player's lap or on a table or chair, and play with the fingers or with drumsticks.

When a tambourine is used in an orchestra it is usually just one tambourine, although Berlioz asked for two tambourines in his overture "Le carnaval romain". It is very often used in music which sounds Italian or Spanish. It nearly always makes music sound very lively, e.g. in the last movement of Prokofiev's First Violin Concerto.

Tachyon

A Tachyon is any hypothetical particle that could travel faster than the speed of light. Curiously, the slower a tachyon moves, the more energy it has. Conversely, the more energy a tachyon has the slower it would go, but never to be equal to or slower than the speed of light.

Scientists do not know if tachyons exist. Einstein's theory of special relativity says nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. If a tachyon did exist, it would have an imaginary number as its mass. Scientists do not know how something with imaginary mass would act, because a particle going this fast may not be affected by the normal "cause and effect" force that affects normal particles.

Many scientists believe that if one tachyon existed in the universe at any time, then the universe would be overrun by more and more tachyons. This is probably due to the fact that as they slow down, they increase energy. However, other scientists still believe that they could exist if they did not interact with normal matter.

All known particles that go below the speed of light (and have mass) are known as bradyons.

Gelatin

Gelatin is a protein substance that comes from collagen. Collagen is a natural protein found in the tendons, ligaments, and tissues of mammals.

It is made by boiling the connective tissues, bones and skins of animals, usually cows and pigs. Once the boiling is done, the collagen will cool and make a jelly. As a food, gelatin is used to make jellied desserts; used in the preservation of fruit and meat, and to make powdered milk. Gelatin can also be used as glue for matches or glue for paper money. You can also find it is used as the syrup in medicine. Also known as medicine emulsions.

Christian naturism

Naturist Christians are the Christians who practice naturism or nudism, and are a part of the clothes-free movement. They believe that the human body was the greatest making of God, and is neither shameful nor should be covered. Naturist Christians can be found in almost all of the different groups of Christianity (called "denominations"), and they do not find any conflict with the teachings of the Bible, and living their lives and worshiping God without any clothing. However, most have various differences with New Age and man-centered philosophy (called "humanism") which is common among other naturists and wish to be separated from it. This includes not worshiping nature at all.

In the Book of Genesis, Adam and Eve were living in the Garden of Eden as 'man and wife' . They ate the fruit not allowed by God, after being talked into it by the devil in the form of a snake. Then their eyes were opened, and they knew that they were naked. So, they gathered fig leaves to be used as simple clothing to cover their sexual organs. These became lacking very quickly, and Adam and Eve hid themselves from God in the trees.


Naturist Christians believe that it was the devil, not God, who told them that they were naked. Nor was it the desire of God that Adam and Eve wore clothing, even though they sinned (did wrong). Still, God did not take away the fig leaves of theirs. Just the opposite, they had free desire, and He made them clothing from the skins of animals, which required a killing an animal (called a "sacrifice"). After the execution of Jesus, the sacrifice of animals is no longer needed for the punishment of sin. For these reasons, Naturist Christians believe that we do not need to wear clothing (except in a cold or difficult climate), and the desire of the flesh (called "lust") can be avoided through God's power.

<doc id="180226" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=180226" title="Lake Eyre">
Lake Eyre

Lake Eyre (pronounced "air") is the lowest point in Australia, at about below sea level. When it fills with water, it is the largest lake in Australia, being long and wide. It is also in the driest part of Australia, getting only about of rain each year. It is in the north of South Australia, about north of Adelaide. The lake was named after the explorer, Edward Eyre, who was the first European to see it in 1840. It is the centre of the Lake Eyre National Park.

Lake Eyre is in the driest desert region of central Australia. It is a large endorheic lake system, which means that the water flows in, but does not flow out. As the water evaporates, the lake dries up leaving a dry salt lake. The lake does not usually completely dry up, there is often water in small areas on the lake surface. The rate that the water dries up is per year, that is about 20 times more than the rainfall in the area.

During the wet season the rivers from Queensland flow towards the lake through the Channel Country. These rivers drain about one sixth of Australia, an area the size of Spain.. How much water reaches the lake depends on how rain falls in Queensland. Since 1885 the lake has filled in 1886/1887, 1889/1890, 1916/1917, 1950, 1955 and 1974-1976. In 1974 Lake Eyre was deep. Local rain filled Lake Eyre to in 1984 and 1989. Very heavy rain in January 2007 took about six weeks to reach the lake but put only a small amount of water into it. In February 2009, water from flooding rains in Queensland were flowing along the creeks to the lake covering about 40 km per day. The lake fills to about every three years, to , every ten years, and fills up about four times every 100 years.

When Lake Eyre is full, the water is almost fresh and native fresh water fish can live in it. The lake becomes saltier as the salt crust dissolves over six months. This kills millions of fish. When about 4m deep the Lake is as salty as the sea. It becomes more salty as the water evaporates. At about 500mm depth the Lake becomes a "pink" color because of a beta-carotene pigment made by the algae "Dunaliella salina".

Beaches made by wave action suggest that during the Medieval Warm Period Lake Eyre possibly held "permanent water" at levels above those of 1974. 

The local Aboriginal people, the Arabunna people, have stories that explain the creation of Lake Eyre. These stories are part of their sacred traditions, and are only told to initiated people.

Fresh water fish found in the full lake include boney bream ("Nematolosa erebi"), the Lake Eyre Basin sub-species of golden perch ("Macquaria ambigua") and various small hardyhead species ("Craterocephalus spp"). The Lake Eyre hardyhead, can live in water up to 15 times saltier than the ocean.

When there is water more than 8 million birds, from more than 60 different species, flock to the lake. The pelicans are usually the first to arrive, followed by silver gulls, hoary headed grebes, Australasian grebes, cormorants, ducks, banded stilts, kites, falcons and wedge tailed eagles. Scientists still do not know how the birds know when the lake holds water.

There is also a lizard, the Lake Eyre Dragon, Ctenophorus maculosus, that lives in the cool mud below the salt crust of the lake.

The "Lake Eyre Yacht Club" is a small group of people who sail on the lake's floods, including recent trips in 1997, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2009. A number of 6 m Trailer Sailers sailed on Lake Eyre in 1975, 1976 and 1984 when the flood depth reached 3–6 m.

The salt crust on the lake is not thick and can break like glass under a person's weight. At Level Post Bay, the crust is more than one metre thick, and because of its flat surface it has been the site for various land speed record attempts. In 1964, British driver, Sir Donald Campbell, set a new record of , in the "Bluebird-Proteus CN7".

Castanets

Castanets are percussion instruments which come from Spain. They are often used in an orchestra. Castanets are hollowed-out wooden shells. A hardwood such as ebony or rosewood is used.

Castanets are used in pairs. Traditionally two pairs are played together, one pair held in each hand. There is a string which passes through small holes in the shells. The player winds the string round the thumb and finger so that the two shells can be clicked together. The two pairs of castanets used are slightly different sizes so that they make a slightly different pitch. The higher pair, known as "hembra" (female), is usually held in the right hand, with the larger "macho" (male) pair held in the left.

Castanets are traditionally played by singers and dancers. Spanish folk dancers often use castanets. They are often associated with flamenco dancing.

When they are played in an orchestra they are often attached to a stand. The technique of playing is therefore different. They can be tapped by the fingers and palm of the hand. They are often used in music which is supposed to sound Spanish. In ballet and opera they are used to accompany Spanish dances. Carmen, the character in Bizet's opera "Carmen", sings a song and accompanies herself on the castanets. Normally the opera singer will not have the skill to play them, so the castanets are played by a percussion player in the orchestra while Carmen pretends to be playing them.

Peravia Province

Peravia is a province in south of the Dominican Republic. The capital city is Baní.

The Peravia province is bordered to the north by the San José de Ocoa province, to the east by the San Cristóbal province, to west by the Azua province and to the south by the Caribbean Sea.

The province was created in 1944 with the name of "Baní Province" but that same year the name was changed to "José Trujillo Valdez Province" after the father of dictator Rafael Trujillo. In 1961, after Trujillo's death, the name of the province was changed to Peravia after the Valley of Peravia where is the city of Baní.

In 2000, the province was divided in two parts and the province of San José de Ocoa was formed with the northern part.

The Peravia province is one of the smallest province in the country with a total area of 792.33 km². It has 1.6% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 29th (out of 31 provinces plus the National District) largest province.

There are two municipalities and 11 municipal districts in the province.

Puerto Plata Province

Puerto Plata is one of the northern provinces of the Dominican Republic. The area is a popular tourist attraction since the late 1990s because there are many fine beaches.

It was created in 1865. It was a municipality of Santiago province before being elevated to the category of province.

Puerto Plata province is along the northern coast of the island. To the north, it has the Atlantic Ocean; to the east, Espaillat; to the south, Santiago and Valverde provinces; and to the west, Monte Cristi province.

The province is named after its capital city, Puerto Plata. 
When Christopher Columbus visited the northern coast of the Hispaniola island for the first time, on 11 January 1493 he saw a mountain with clouds on its top and he gave it the name of "Monte de Plata" (in English, Mountain of Silver). The town that was founded on the foot of that mountain was called "Puerto de Plata" (in English, Port of Silver); the name was changed later to just "Puerto Plata".

The first European town, La Isabela, was founded by Columbus in January 1493 by Columbus near the city of Puerto Plata; the city of Puerto Plata was founded in 1502.

It was created as a Maritime District (a special administrative category similar to a province and that has been abandoned) in 1865. The 1907 Dominican Constitution changed its status to province. It was part of Santiago province before being elevated to the category of province.

Puerto Plata province has a total area of 1,852.90 km. It has 3.8% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 10th (out of 31 provinces plus the National District) largest province.

There are nine municipalities and 12 municipal districts in the province. The municipalities and their municipal districts (M.D.) are:


In 2002 (last national census), there were 312,706 people living in the Puerto Plata province, and 157,282 (50.3%) living in towns and cities. The population density was 168.8 persons/km.

The "Cordillera Septentrional" (in English, "Northern mountain range") runs along the southern half of the province. Another mountain range is Sierra Atravesada that goes from the Cordillera Septentrional to the coast. The mountain "Isabel de Torres" (the "Monte de Plata" of Columbus) is close to the city of Puerto Plata.

Because the Cordillera Septentrional is close to the coast, rivers in this province are short. The most important rivers are Bajabonico, Yásica and Camú del Norte.

There are several important economic activities in the province, like tourism along the coast, farming and industry (like food products and rhum).

<doc id="180237" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=180237" title="Vibraphone">
Vibraphone

The vibraphone is an percussion instrument. It looks like a xylophone but the bars are made of aluminium instead of wood. Like the xylophone, the bars are arranged in a similar way to a piano keyboard so that tunes can be played. An alternate form is the 6-plus-6-system, where each row has the bars in a whole-tone distance and both rows are in a half-tone distance. The player uses mallets (beaters), either one or two in each hand. There are tubes underneath each bar. These are called "resonators". They make the sound louder. There is also an electric motor which can be switched on by a pedal. This makes fans go round and round in the ventilators and makes a very strong, vibrating sound. This is why the instrument has its name. Sometimes people call a vibraphone vibes. 

Vibraphones were first made in the United States in 1921.

The mallets are beaters with a rubber ball at the end. Yarn or a hard cord is wound tightly round these balls. Vibraphone mallets are usually slightly harder than the ones ones used for the marimba. They usually consist of a rubber ball core wrapped in yarn or cord and attached to a narrow dowel, most commonly made of rattan or birch (other materials, such as nylon, are sometimes used). Mallets suitable for the vibraphone are also generally suitable for the marimba. There are different ways of holding them. A common way is to hold them between the thumb and index finger, using the other fingers to help control the sticks. Playing with four mallets is harder, but allows the player to play harmony (chord with four notes).

Sometimes special techniques are used such as "pitch bending". This is done by sliding one of the mallets along a bar in a special way. Occasionally players are asked to use a bow such as cello or double bass bow, and bow across the edge of a bar.

The vibraphone is used in the orchestra in Alban Berg's opera "Lulu". It is also used in works by Olivier Messiaen, Leonard Bernstein, Benjamin Britten and Vaughan Williams (opening of Symphony no 8). Vibraphones are commonly heard in jazz, especially in combos.

Pwn

Pwn is a slang term, which came from the verb "own". It implies ownership, as in domination and humiliation of a rival. It is usually used only on the Internet. The past tense may also be spelled: pwnd, pwn'd pwn3d, pwnt or powned.

The word "pwn" may have begun as a typo of "own" because the p and o keys are close to each other on a standard English keyboard.

Pwn comes from the word pwned, that comes from the word owned and that comes from the word own.

Of these, roughly 1.3 million live in the 15 biggest cities, namely Louisville (560.000), Lexington (280.000), Owensboro (55.000), Bowling Green (54.000), Covington (43.000), Richmond (32.000), Hopkinsville (31.000), Henderson (27.000), Frankfort (27.000), Florence (27.000), Jeffersontown (26.000), Nicholasville (25.000), Paducah (25.000), Elizabethtown (23.000), and Ashland (22.000). The category Cities in Kentucky currently has 428 entries. I would therefore like to propose to delete all the articles in the category, meaning the 413 cities not listed here, as they are probably small, and do not stand a big chance of ever getting extended to something that could become a good article. A one-line stub (even if extended to 5 lines) does not serve much, if it has no potential of ever getting bigger. Please note: I have not tagged the 413 cities concerned with the rfd tag. -- () 14:34, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

Infantilism

"Infantilism" or "Paraphilic Infantilism" is a paraphilia to desire to wear diapers and be treated like an infant, or more commonly, a toddler. Such people are usually referred to as "Infantilists" or "Adult Babies".

Some "Infantilists" are diaper lovers (DL) as well, so they are usually referred to as "AB/DLs". Most infantilists are heterosexual, or straight males.

Infantilism or diaper fetishes are different in self image and the focus of attention. Both ideals can be found in the same person at the same time and are similar. However, it must be said that both have nothing to do with having a sexual preference for children, or pedophilia. In any case, there is no single form, but a variety of infantilism types. Some infantilists are not obvious and try to blend in, while others wish they could be free of all guilt and responsibilities. All variations focus on diapers and babyhood.

Now I've seen people use this against me and everyone agrees with it (such as that a couple months ago) but when I use it against them they shoot it down saying this isn't en (such as here), now we have to be consistent, either we use or we don't. There is no case-by-case basis here. So I propose we create our own version of here. Thoughts?--     01:12, 16 April 2009 (UTC)
It's really common sense and depends on the context of an article. For instance, 10 Downing Street's door is black in colour, yet the color of the White House is white. The Empire State Building is x meters tall, but Nelson's Column is x metres tall. HOWEVER, and this is the key thing, there is never any reason for changing the version that has already been added just for the sake of it () 10:49, 16 April 2009 (UTC)

I know this probably won't work because editors won't participate, but here goes nothing.
This page has just had a discussion about editors working together for GAs and VGAs, and the VGA nomination page has discussed how it would be nice to improve important articles. One of the articles suggested was Ghandi. is an FA, so it's obviously comprehensive. I am proposing that we get a group of editors (15?), copy the English article on Ghandi, and assign each editor one section to simplify. We then put the sections together, making a near VGA. The red links might be harder, but I'm sure people will get it done if it meant getting an article like Ghandi to VGA. This might be crazy enough to work. If you want to help, or have any questions, please discuss below. Cheers :) 
By the way, I would be willing to facilitate this.     12:03, 16 April 2009 (UTC)

Hello all. I can remember that there was something like a Wikicup here on simple. I don't know, but I think it was stopped, because of inactivity, or so. I think we should start instead of this kind of cup an other one. I think about and . It could be the same like the wicicup, but only with this two things. Something like: for every good article, you get one credit and for every very good article, you get 5 credits. The new cup should also be with a final, a semi-final and so on.

Hello there,

we seem to have many articles like Providence, Kentucky (version at time of this post), which really only consist of one sentence. Personally, I think these are not helpful, as there is no information, a possible reader could get from the article. I therefore see too options:

Personally, I am leaning towards deletion, but I want to bring it up here, so it can be discussed. -- () 11:40, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

I agree with Eptalon and Either way. An article like "XYZ is in ABC." isn't an article. That is like "XYZ is born on..." or "a chair is in every flat." Where is the content. When I read an aricle about a town, then I want to know at least where this town is or how big the population is. If I look for a town, so I know that this town exists. But this articles don't say more like there is a town. On the other hand are around 20,000 articles a lot for this small wikipedia. There are 20,000 article with the sentence "XYZ exists." We should work on the quality and not on the quantity. -- () 15:21, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

I still believe a stub is better than nothing, a drive by editor is more likely to expand a stub than create a new article. - () 19:29, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

Ok, perhaps I spell out doom for some of those cities, but here is the truth: we probably can not save all of them. Here's a possible way forward (iterate for each state):

I think what is being missed is that it doesn't have to be obvious in the article itself, it just has be be recognized in the talk page or the edit history via a link to the old edit history. I am pretty sure I read that en.wiki actually has something stating that it shouldn't be mentioned in the article itself. - () 15:53, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

Hello gang,

Just making a final call for any more items to go in Simple News. The next issue is going out later today.

Regards,

In many articles, the "In other languages" list is longer than the article itself. This means that when you use "end" or "Page Dn" to scroll to the end of the article (to see templates/categories at the end of the article) you are sent far past that point (see Iowa for an example of this). Is there a way to hide those links that would extend past the end of the article? I think this would require a change to or but don't know enough to propose the actual code to use. --""  19:04, 21 April 2009 (UTC)

One of our deletion reasons redirects to about biographies of living people.

This is here can some of you peoples be nice and talk to me Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease

Hello all, any editors volunteering to help build the list of core topics? - This would work as follows:


I would say, we start with a list of max. 50 articles (to be split in core, and nice to have, eg. 35,15, or 25,25). At least half the articles should be core. I do not want to do this discussion here. To build these lists we need 3-5 people per "subject area" - ideally people who have a good knowledge in the resp. subject area. I could also think that on this we could collaborate with EnWP to some extent.

For myself, I can help with anything Natural-sciences related, as a start. -- () 10:20, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

Uh, I can't see Geography... If the worst comes to the worst, I'll go with Daily Life / Art / Culture, and Government / Law. </font face> </font face> 11:58, 29 April 2009 (UTC)
Perhaps I spell out the obvious: What you find out as cats above are the 6 "Knolwedge Groups" we have on the main page. - Anyway, I think we will soon need to move this to some kind of wikiproject, as it has well gone past general discussion. Another issue would be: does it make sense to take (part of) the list they have on EnWP? - There they ate many more people, and have many more resources; also do you think that a few of the people involved in the project at EnWP would like to help here? -- () 13:54, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

I can help with history, biology (only some parts), maths and physics. (But I'm busy at the moment) Regards, () 13:59, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

I'll try, and it will probably come out completely wrong: "A concept/article is core in a given field of science if that field of science cannot be reasonably understood without that concept/article, or if the given concept helps understanding a great deal." -More to the point here though: The editors who volunteered should work out a list (of at most 50) articles they consider core.-- () 15:36, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

Perhaps another idea of core: Daily page views (for today), Monthly top 1k, yearly those are the pages people look at, if we improve those first, we will likely see a result sooner. -- () 10:21, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

Need I say more...?

Ok, I will anyway. You wanted back. So it came back. Now, "less than a week after", it has effectively died again, with just one nomination remaining. One update was made, but now all has gone quiet.

Now, i'm sure you'll agree that it's unproffesional to have something coming then going multiple times, so:

If the answer is no to one or either, then let's just kill it now and not revive it. If it's yes... do something about it.

Going on TRM's ideas, perhaps 1-2 per day is fine. I should be remembered that seWP is not a large as enWP. -- 00:27, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

A quick question. If I wanted to copy everything on Simple Wikipedia and install it on my own server, where I could then place adverts, etc, how would I go about exporting everything (mainspace, userspace, templates, etc, the whole lot)? () 18:36, 3 May 2009 (UTC)

At present, the category contains over 1,200 pages; and there are probably many more complex pages that have not been tagged as such. While I plan on tackling this massive backlog, I'm going to need all the help I can get, and so I thought to myself, "wouldn't it be great if there was a collaborative group of Wikipedians whose goal was to make the Simple English Wikipedia easier for our intended readers to understand?" My goal is to found – a collaborative group of Wikipedians who work to clear out the massive backlog of complex pages here on the Simple English Wikipedia.

<doc id="180344" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=180344" title="Swine influenza">
Swine influenza

Swine influenza virus (often shortened to SIV or swine flu) is one of a number of viruses that are endemic to pigs. This type of influenza viruses can also infect humans and birds. 

Swine flu is common in pigs but it normally only infects people who have been in close contact with pigs, but there have been cases where the disease was spread from one person to another. Symptoms of infection include fever, disorientation, stiffness of the joints, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, that sometimes finally ends in death.
Types of flu strain include H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, H3N2, and H2N3. are known to cause swine influenza. 

H1N1 came from the Spanish flu, which caused a pandemic in humans in 1918 and 1919. Viruses that came from the Spanish flu virus have stayed in pigs. They have also circulated in humans in the 20th century, although they occurred at the same time as the epidemics that occur every year, making it hard to tell the difference between 'normal' influenza and swine influenza. Infections that occur from pigs to humans are rare though, there have been 12 known cases in the United States since 2005. 

The flu virus is one of the hardest viruses known to man: It changes its form all the time. That way, antibodies that the body has developed from previous infections or from vaccines do not react to it. The virus only changes a little bit in a period of about two to three years. After about ten years, most people have developed antibodies to these small changes. The virus then changes a lot, there is a pandemic. Hundreds of millions of people are suddenly made aware that the antibodies they developed are useless. Even during the Spanish flu pandemic, the first wave of the disease was relatively mild, while the second wave was highly lethal.

In 1957, an Asian flu pandemic infected some 45 million Americans and killed 70,000. Eleven years later, lasting from 1968 to 1969, the Hong Kong flu pandemic afflicted 50 million Americans and caused 33,000 deaths, costing approximately $3.9 billion. In 1976, about 500 soldiers became infected with swine flu over a period of a few weeks. However, by the end of the month investigators found that the virus had "mysteriously disappeared", and there were no more signs of swine flu anywhere on the post. There were isolated cases around the U.S., but those cases were supposedly to individuals who caught the virus from pigs. 

Scientists fear the swine flu virus might mutate into a pandemic as deadly as that of 1918/1919. They have watched the outbreak in 2009, and made plans what to do if a global pandemic breaks out.

The main symptoms of the swine influenza is much the same as regular influenza. Symptoms include vomiting, nausea, runny nose, (loss of appetite), lethargy (feeling tired), chills, fever, body aches, sore throat, coughing, diarrhea, and stomach ache.

The bird flu virus H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China. It has recently been found in pigs in Vietnam. Specialists also think that this might lead to new variations of the influenza virus. Pigs can carry human influenza viruses. These viruses can combine in new ways, and exchange certain genes with H5N1. Through mutation, this would create a form of the virus that can pass easily among humans. H3N2 evolved from H2N2 by antigenic shift. In August 2004, researchers in China found H5N1 in pigs. 

In 2005 it was discovered that H5N1 could be infecting up to half of the pig population in some areas of Indonesia, but without showing symptoms. Chairul Nidom, a virologist at Airlangga University's tropical disease center in Surabaya, East Java, did some independent research: he tested the blood of 10 apparently healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in West Java where avian flu had broken out, "Nature" reported. Five of the pig samples contained the H5N1 virus. The Indonesian government has since found similar results in the same region. Additional tests of 150 pigs outside the area were negative.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a United States government agency, reports that the symptoms and transmission of the swine flu from human to human is much like seasonal flu. Usually, the symptoms are fever, lethargy (feeling tired), lack of appetite and coughing. Some people with swine flu also have reported runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. It is believed to be spread between humans when an infected person coughs or sneezes and then touches something. Another person then might touch the same thing with the virus on it and then touch their own nose or mouth. The swine flu in humans is most contagious during the first five days of the illness although some people, most commonly children, can be contagious for up to ten days. Diagnosis can be made by sending a specimen (sample), collected during the first five days, to the CDC for analysis.

The Swine Flu is susceptible to four licensed drugs in the United States, amantadine, rimantadine, oseltamivir and zanamivir. However, for the 2009 outbreak, it is recommended it be treated with oseltamivir and zanamivir. The vaccine for the human seasonal flu does not protect against the swine flu. Even if the virus strains are the same specific variety, the antigenicity is very different.
The virus has evolved in recent decades. This has made Swine influenza a bigger problem, mainly because traditional vaccines against influenza do not always work against Swine influenza. There are special vaccines against Swine influenza, but they only work if the virus strain is similar to some extent. In the cases more difficult to treat, special vaccines are produced. These are very similar, as they are made to match the specific virus strain.

Present vaccination strategies for SIV control and prevention in swine farms, typically include the use of one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of non-reactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests that current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses.

The current vaccine against the seasonal influenza strain H1N1 is thought unlikely to provide protection. The director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said that the United States' cases were found to be made up of genetic elements from four different flu viruses—North American swine influenza, North American avian influenza, human influenza A virus subtype H1N1, and swine influenza virus typically found in Asia and Europe. On two cases, a complete genome sequence had been obtained. She said that the virus is resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, but susceptible to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza).

The new strain of swine influenza A is called H1N1 is responsible for the swine flu outbreak in 2009 in humans. It resulted from a combination of several strains of influenza in humans and influenza in birds as well as swine influenza. Tests were done, they found that the hemagglutinin (HA) gene was similar to that of swine flu viruses present in United States pigs since 1999, but the neuraminidase (NA) and matrix protein (M) genes resembled versions present in European swine. Viruses that were built like this had not been found in humans or pigs before. There is no program to monitor what viruses are circulating in pigs in the United States, however. People currently ignore where this new strain of viruses came from. 

The first known case was a five year old boy, named Edgar Hernandez. The boy had been near a pig farm in La Gloria, Veracruz state in Mexico. This farm raises almost one million pigs a year.
People living nearby have been complaining about the clouds of flies. These flies are attracted by so-called "manure lagoons", which is one of the problems such large farms have. It was first thought the boy had a normal influenza. Laboratory tests showed, however, that he had contracted swine flu. The boy fully recovered.

"If the people who are supposed to be familiar with this didn't know what it was, how will we ever know how my son got it?" Edgar's mother, Hernandez said.

La Gloria, Perote, Veracruz is a small community, surrounded by large pig farms. Reports indicate that during February 2009 over 400 people in the town had flu like symptoms and 2 infants died of 'pneumonia'. 

Juan Rodriguez died of 'pneumonia' February 9th at age 7 months.

Yovanni Apolinar also died of 'pneumonia' March 12th aged 2 months.

An unidentified Mexican toddler contracted swine flu in Brownsville, Texas, United States and died April 29th in Houston, Texas, United States at age 23 months.

The United States Department of Agriculture researchers say that while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick, it does not block infection or shedding of the virus.

Dr. Anne Schuchat, interim Deputy Director for CDC Science and Public Health, said that the American cases were found to be made up of genetic elements from four different flu viruses – North American swine influenza, North American avian influenza (bird flu), human influenza, and swine influenza virus typically found in Asia and Europe – "an unusually mongrelised mix of genetic sequences." Pigs have been shown to act as a potential "mixing vessel" in which reassortment can occur between flu viruses of several species. This new strain appears to be a result of reassortment of human influenza and swine influenza viruses, presumably due to superinfection in an individual human. Influenza viruses readily undergo reassortment due to antigenic shift because their genome is split between eight pieces of RNA (see Orthomyxoviridae).

The current strain of swine flu can adapt to humans and spread more efficiently than previously known swine H1N1 strains. Moreover, co-infection of H1N1 swine flu and Oseltamivir resistant H1N1 season flu can lead to acquisition of the H274Y mutation by the swine flu via recombination or reassortment. Swine H1N1 with human H1 and N1 have been reported.

The 1918 flu pandemic strain had undergone polymorphism from swine and human H1N1 in all eight pieces of RNA gene segments. Similar swapping of gene segments in humans co-infected with seasonal human influenza and swine H1N1 can lead to rapid evolution.

The new strain of swine influenza A (H1N1) is currently listed by the United States and World Health Organization as a Stage 5 pandemic virus.

Myers-Briggs Type Indicator

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a set of questions based on psychology. By answering the questions people can learn about how they tend to make choices. They can also learn about how they view the world. After answering the questions in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator people are placed in one of sixteen groups. These groups are based on theories by Carl Gustav Jung in his book "Psychological Types" which was published in 1921. 

Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers first created the set of questions in the time of World War II. The set of questions was made to help women who were working for the first time. Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Meyers thought that the set of questions would help women be happier and work better. The set of questions has grown into the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. The MBTI that we use today was created in 1962. 

The MBTI measures four things. The first is Introversion (I) and Extraversion (E). Extraversion and Introversion are outlooks. Extraverts are people who get energy from the outside world. Extraverts tend to like to spend their time with other people. Introverts are people who get energy from the inside world. Introverts tend to get energy from thinking and reflecting.

The second measure is Sensing (S) and Intuition (N). Sensing and Intuition are ways of gathering information. People who are Sensing (S) trust facts. Sensing people accept things if they can see, hear, touch, taste, or smell them. People who tend to like Intuition (N) are more likely to accept outcomes based on other people and meanings that cannot be tested. 

The third measure is Thinking (T) and Feeling (F). Thinking and Feeling are ways that people make decisions. Those who prefer Thinking (T) tend to make decisions alone. They heavily weigh reason, good sense, order, and cause and effect. Those who prefer Feeling (F) are more likely to think of the effect that a decision may have on other people. They tend to try to gain balance and agreement with everyone that is involved. 
It is important to note that those who prefer Thinking (T) do not “think better” than those who prefer Feeling, and those who prefer Feeling do not make decisions based only on people.

The last measure is of Judging (J) and Perceiving (P). Judging and Perceiving detail how people deal with the outside world. A person who likes Judging tends to report that they use Thinking or Feeling to deal with the outside world. A person who likes Perceiving tends to report that they use Sensing or Intuition to deal with the outside world.

A Myers Briggs type is made up of each of the preferences above. 
For example an ESTJ would be a person who prefers Extraversion, Sensing, Thinking, and Judging.
An INFP would be a person who prefers Introversion, Intuition, Feeling, and Perceiving.

Bouvet Island

Bouvet Island (, also historically known as Liverpool Island or Lindsay Island) is an island in the Southern part of the Atlantic Ocean, located in the sub-antarctic areas, 2500 km (1500 miles) south-southwest of the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa). 

It belongs to Norway and is not subject to the Antarctic Treaty (which says that land south of 60°S, including Antarctica, do not belong to any country). It is the most remote island in the world, which means that is farther from other land than any other island on Earth. The closest piece of land to the island is Queen Maud Land in Antarctica, which is more than 1600 km (994 miles) away. Nobody lives there, and there are rarely any visitors.

The island is volcanic and has high cliffs on all sides (created by high waves over thousands of years). 90% of its area is covered by glaciers (ice). The climate is cold and does not change much, with an average of +1ºC in the warmest month, and −3ºC in the coldest.

There are penguins, sea birds and seals on the island.

Occidental College

Occidental College is a small college in Los Angeles, California. Several famous people, such as Barack Obama, have attended the college. Its name comes from the Latin for "western".

The college was started in 1887 and moved to where it is now in 1914. Many of its early buildings were designed by Myron Hunt. After World War II, Oxy became known both for being a very good school and for student protests. Its current president is Jonathan Veitch.

The school has 1,825 students. The school is 60% female and 40% male. 

All Occidental students must take a “Core Program” that includes classes in writing, the arts, humanities, foreign languages, math and science. Occidental is known for student research projects. Many of Occidental's students study at the United Nations, in Washington, DC, and in other countries. 

Occidental has Division III sports teams in 19 sports, including football, basketball, baseball and soccer.

Famous students include Barack Obama (for two years), Ben Affleck, Luke Wilson, Jack Kemp, and Patt Morrison.

Occidental has been in many movies, including "Fired Up", "", and "Beverly Hills, 90210". It has also appeared in hundreds of advertisements.

A Vindication of the Rights of Woman

A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects is a book written by Mary Wollstonecraft in 1792. Today, it is known as one of the first books about feminism. In the 18th century, some people thought that women should not get a formal education. Wollstonecraft wrote this work as a reply to them. She says that women should have an education that fits their position in society. She says women are very important to the nation, because it is women who usually educate their children. She says that an educated woman can also be companions to their husbands, rather than just uneducated wives. Wollstonecraft does not see women as ornaments to society, or property to be traded in marriage. She argues that they are human beings, and therefore deserve the same basic rights men have.

In 1791, Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord wrote a report to the French National Assembly. In this report, he argued, that women should only receive a very basic education. 
Wollstonecraft used this report to write her reply. She also led an attack on the sexual double standards the society of the day had. She also indicted men for encouraging women to indulge in lots of emotion. Wollstonecraft wrote the "Rights of Woman" quickly so that she could directly respond to ongoing events; she wanted to write a more thoughtful second volume, but died before doing so.

Wollstonecraft calls for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life, such as morality, but she does not write that men and women are equal in all things. This has made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist as they believe men and women are equal in all things. She could not use either the word or the concept of "feminism", because they were only developed later. Today, many people believe that her work was not received well, but this may be wrong. People who believe this also believe that Wollstonecraft was as reviled during her lifetime as she became after the publication of William Godwin's "Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" (1798). However, the "Rights of Woman" was actually well-received when it was first published in 1792. One biographer has called it "perhaps the most original book of [Wollstonecraft's] century".

Supercontinent

A supercontinent is a landmass which has more than one continental core, or craton. They are formed by continental plate convergence.

Eurasia is certainly a supercontinent, but the Americas are usually considered separately. Even more clearly, Gondwana and Laurasia were supercontinents formed by the breakup of the global supercontinent Pangaea.

The landbridge between North and South America is "geologically" a rather temporary link, so they would not usually be described as one supercontinent.

Oyster card

The Oyster card is a form of electronic ticketing used on public transport services within the London region of the England. It is promoted by Transport for London and is valid on a number of different travel systems across London including London Underground, buses, the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), London Overground, trams, some river boat services and most National Rail services within the London Fare Zones. More importantly, it is very similar to Travelcard, a branch from the original London's e-payment cards.

A standard Oyster card is a blue credit card-sized stored value card which can hold a variety of single tickets, period tickets and travel permits which must be added to the card prior to travel. It is also a contactless smartcard which passengers must touch onto an electronic reader when entering and leaving the transport system in order to validate it or deduct funds. The cards may be "recharged" in person from numerous sales points, by recurring payment authority or by online purchase. The card is designed to reduce the number of transactions at ticket offices and the number of single paper tickets sold on the London transport network. Use is encouraged by offering substantially cheaper fares on Oyster than payment with cash.

The card was first issued to the public in July 2003 with a limited range of features and there continues to be a phased introduction of further functions. By June 2010, over 34 million Oyster cards had been issued and more than 80% of all journeys on services run by Transport for London used the Oyster card.

<doc id="180669" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=180669" title="Cymbal">
Cymbal

Cymbals (pronounce like the word “symbol”) are percussion instruments. They are discs made of copper, bronze or a special alloy. They look rather like saucepan lids, but in the middle they jut out a little and they have straps there that pass through a hole.

There are two ways of playing cymbals. One way is to use a pair of cymbals that are the same. The player holds one cymbal in each hand, holding them by the strap. He then bangs the cymbals together. There are many ways of doing this depending on the sort of sound that is wanted. For example, a very quiet sound can be made by rubbing the edges of the cymbals together. A very loud sound can be made by hitting them together as the arms form a circle, and letting the cymbals vibrate for a long time by holding them in the air.

Another way of playing the cymbal is to use just one cymbal, and to hang it on a stand. It can then be played with a beater, stick or wire brush. It can be hit at the edge, in the middle, or half way between, depending on the sound that is wanted. 

Cymbals are made in different sizes. Some may be just 25 cm across, large ones may be up to 60 cm across. Cymbals do not normally give any particular pitch. There are, however, small ones based on an old form of cymbal which are called “crotales”. There are also Chinese cymbals which have a turned-up edge. 

Cymbals are used in many different musical groups. They are heard in an orchestra, in jazz groups, percussion groups and bands, including marching bands. A drum kit always has at least one cymbal. This may be a “crash cymbal” (on the top of a stand) or a pair of hi-hats (a pair of small cymbals operated by pressing a pedal with the foot.

The word cymbal comes from the Latin "cymbalum", which itself comes from the Greek word "kumbalom", meaning a small bowl. It was used in many ancient cultures including Egyptian civilisations.

Cymbals are often used in orchestras. The first composer to use them was probably Joseph Haydn in his “Military Symphony” (1794). They are often used when there is a big climax (for example in the “Academic Festival Overture” by Johannes Brahms, but they can also sometimes be played very quietly. Sometimes players should let the cymbal vibrate for a long time after a big crash, but at other times he may have to hold the cymbals against his body quickly to stop the noise. This is called “damping” the sound.

Cymbals have traditionally often been played together with the bass drum. This makes a "crash-bang-wallop" noise.

Woodblock

A wood block is a small percussion instrument. It is made of wood and hit like a drum. The woodblock is hollow inside so that it makes a big, resonating sound. It can come in different forms, but many modern woodblocks are shaped like a brick.

It is sometimes called a Chinese block because it has Chinese origins.

The sticks used to hit the woodblock can be snare drum sticks or xylophone beaters. It makes a hard, high sound. It can often be heard in large orchestras, e.g. in Bernstein's "West Side Story".

Berwickshire

Berwickshire is a British county in Scotland. It is also the name of a committee area of the Scottish Borders Council. Berwickshire is on the boundary of Scotland with England. It is named after Berwick-upon-Tweed, but Scotland lost Berwick to England in 1482.

Berwickshire's first county town was the Royal Burgh of Berwick-upon-Tweed. In 1482 England seized Berwick. After that the shire's business was done at Duns or Lauder until Greenlaw became the county town in 1596.

A Sheriff Court sits in Duns.

Berwickshire County Council, like all the County Councils in Scotland, was made in 1890. The Council met in Duns. Berwickshire County Council was ended in 1975.

In 1975 a new Borders Region was made. A Berwickshire District Council was made within it too, with an area like the county’s but not the same. Berwickshire District Council was ended in 1996.

Berwickshire is now all in the Scottish Borders Council Area.

In 1890, when Berwickshire County Council was made, the Council asked the Lord Lyon King of Arms to give them a shield and arms. He gave a shield and arms to the County Council on 10 October 1890.

The shield shows a bear chained to a wych-elm tree. The bear and wych-elm are part of Berwick upon Tweed’s shield because they sound like the town’s name.

On 12 November 1975 the Lord Lyon gave the arms again to Berwickshire District Council. When the district council ended in 1996, the right to the arms went back to the Queen.
Berwickshire’s name is still used locally. "The Berwickshire News" is a newspaper in the county and many groups keep "Berwickshire" in their titles.

The Berwickshire Civic Society is (2009) asking the Council to put road signs up to tell drivers who are coming into the county that they are coming into Berwickshire. The Berwickshire Civic Society has a "Keep Berwickshire Tidy" competition each April.

Places in Berwickshire include:

Claves (Spanish word: second e is sounded) are percussion instruments. They are small wooden sticks made of tropical hardwood. They are used in pairs. They are traditionally heard in Cuban music, e.g. salsa. 

In Cuban music they often repeat a special rhythm called "clave" (pronounce: "CLAH-ve").

The usual way of playing claves is to hold one clave lightly between the thumb and the fingertips with the palm of the hand facing upwards, or to cradle the clave in the hand. The other, held with the other hand, hits it.

Pacific Electric Railroad Bridge

The Pacific Electric Railroad Bridge or Southern Pacific Railroad Bridge is a historic railroad bridge in Torrance, California USA. It spans across Torrance Boulevard at Bow Street, a short distance west of Western Avenue. It was once part of the north/south Torrance to San Pedro spur line of the Pacific Electric Railway. The line was the railroad's first interurban line to San Pedro. After splitting off to the east from the Union Tool Company plant which was once a short distance south of the bridge, the line ended at a Columbia Steel steel mill (later United States Steel) by running up and over the east/west Torrance local line. It is the only part of the PE which crossed itself this way. This was due to the area's geography. If the railroad simply built a spur off of the main line, it would have meant that trains trying to get to the steel mill would have faced too steep a climb. The steel mill has since been torn down to make way for the national headquarters of American Honda Motor Company, but the remaining part of the Torrance line - which once had two separate tracks - was rebuilt in 2003 and is still in use for local train runs by the Union Pacific Railroad. Gone too are the Pacific Electric's Torrance shops at the western branch of the split, now the site of an industrial park and which still receives trains on the local line.

The bridge was designed by Irving Gill and was built in 1913 as part of the original layout of the city as drawn up by Jared Sidney Torrance and Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.. It became the city's second entry in the National Register of Historic Places on July 13, 1989 after Torrance High School. It is also listed with the California Office of Historic Preservation. 

Though tracks and track parts remain on the bridge, it is no longer in use nor has it been for quite some time. There is no chance of the bridge ever being used to carry trains again, since the right-of-way at either end has been changed and the tracks removed. Even so, the Pacific Electric Railroad Bridge has become a symbol of the city as part of the Torrance Police Department's logo as of January 1, 2000, only the third such change in the department's history.

Anglerfish

Anglerfish are marine fish that belong to the order Lophiiformes. Anglerfish are noted for having a bait-like appendage in front of their heads, right above their mouths. 

The appendage, which resembles a fishing pole, is attached to the end of the dorsal fin's front spine, which is separated from the rest of the fin. Anglerfish light their rod with bioluminescence (their own light) and then wiggle it to mimic a small marine animal. When other creatures come to eat the small marine animal, the anglerfish eats them. They are called anglerfish because they catch fish with bait, just like anglers, who use a rod and line (rather than nets).

A mitochondrial genome phylogenetic study suggested that anglerfishes diversified in a short period of the Lower Cretaceous, between 130 and 100 million years ago.

Omid Djalili

Omid Djalili (Persian: امید جلیلی) is a British comedian and actor. He was born on 30 September 1965.

He was born in Chelsea, London, to Iranian Bahá'í parents. He is a member of the Bahá'í religion. He went to Holland Park School and then the University of Ulster, Northern Ireland, to study English and Theatre Studies. As a Bahá'í, he signed a letter to the leaders of Iran saying that they way they treated Bahá'í people was very bad.

His first good comedy job was at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1995, with his act "Short, Fat Kebab Shop Owner's Son". His next success was in 1996 with "The Arab and the Jew". He said he was the only Iranian comedian, which was still "three more than Germany". His jokes are often about different religions and the funny differences. He has energy on stage and his good pretend voices, together with political jokes mixed with strange belly dancing.

Some countries he has performed in include Australia, Denmark, Canada, Ireland and the USA. "The Observer" said he was one of the top 50 funny people in British comedy. In 2005 he went on the British car TV show "Top Gear" as a special guest driver. The same year he also did stand up comedy for "Comic Relief", a British TV show where people are funny to raise money for poor people. Also that year he had the biggest number of tickets sold for the Edinburgh Festival box office, which was 16,500 sales.

On 17 November 2007, his own TV show started on BBC One, which is a mix of him talking and showing short funny films. A second series started on 20 April 2009.

Orthomyxoviridae

The Orthomyxoviridae ("orthos", Greek for "straight"; "myxa", Greek for "mucus") are a family of RNA viruses. They include five genera: Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C, Thogotovirus and Isavirus. The first three genera contain viruses that cause influenza in vertebrates, including birds (see also avian influenza), humans, and other mammals. Isaviruses infect salmon; thogotoviruses infect vertebrates and invertebrates, such as mosquitoes and sea lice.

The three genera of Influenzavirus can be told apart by the structure of their proteins. They infect vertebrates, as follows:

There are three genera of influenza virus: Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B and Influenzavirus C. Each genus includes only one species, or type: Influenza A virus, Influenza B virus, and Influenza C virus, respectively. Influenza A and C infect multiple species, while influenza B almost exclusively infects humans.

Influenza A viruses are further classified, based on the viral surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA or H) and neuraminidase (NA or N). Sixteen H subtypes (or serotypes) and nine N subtypes of influenza A virus have been identified.

Further variation exists; thus, specific influenza strain isolates are identified by a standard nomenclature specifying virus type, geographical location where first isolated, sequential number of isolation, year of isolation, and HA and NA subtype.

Examples of the nomenclature are: 

The type A viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the three influenza types and causes the most severe disease. The serotypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths, are:


Influenza B virus is almost exclusively a human pathogen, and is less common than influenza A. The only other animal known to be susceptible to influenza B infection is the seal. This type of influenza mutates at a rate 2-3 times lower than type A and consequently is less genetically diverse, with only one influenza B serotype. As a result of this lack of antigenic diversity, a degree of immunity to influenza B is usually acquired at an early age. However, influenza B mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible. This reduced rate of antigenic change, combined with its limited host range (inhibiting cross species antigenic shift), ensures that pandemics of influenza B do not occur.

The influenza C virus infects humans and pigs, and can cause severe illness and local epidemics. However, influenza C is less common than the other types and usually seems to cause mild disease in children.

Bethnal Green railway station is in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in east London. The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by National Express East Anglia, on the West Anglia route, and it is in Travelcard Zone 2. The station was formerly called "Bethnal Green Junction" and was also served by trains on the Great Eastern Main Line.

The typical off-peak service from the station is:

Oyster card (pay as you go) is accepted at the station from 2 January 2008. 

In 1872 the Great Eastern Railway opened a new branch to Hackney Downs to serve this branch a new junction was built to the west of Cambridge Heath Road. 

It also replaced a station called Mile End which was located on the eastern side of Cambridge Heath Road with a station immediately to the west of the new junction called Bethnal Green Junction. It served both of the Great Eastern Railway routes and had four platforms. In 1946 this station stopped serving the Great Eastern main line to Shenfield and two platforms were closed, though the remains of the Shenfield down platform are still visible. The Shenfield up (London-bound) platform was demolished and the tracks rearranged, coinciding with the swapping of services from the former fast tracks onto the former slow (resulting in the arrangement we see today). It is not known for certain when the station's name was changed, possibly when it ceased serving the Shenfield line.

I had a first look, and the article looks pretty good. There are a few red-links left to fill, but thats all I think that needs to be done to get this to VGA status. -- () 08:26, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

Hi all! I think Ludwig van Beethoven can become one of our very good articles. I added some refs to the article. I am sure that it need some more work. I hope for help and comments. () 10:17, 24 May 2009 (UTC)

OK! I will try it. We need more VGAs. I think this article can become one of our very good articles. Göring has a lot of refs and some websites, which can be used as further readings. I think there is some work to do on the article. I hope for some comments and probably some help. Regards, () 19:55, 30 May 2009 (UTC)

Is a GA with several sources. I feel it can be taken to VGA with some work. 13:08, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

Still some bits and bobs to deal with on the talk page which I am sorting out, but I largely think this is ready and so am bringing it to PVGA. Probably needs some further simplification, and I know there are some refs and redlinks to sort out. Please come and review and/or help :). Regards, 19:26, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

Procedural comment: I was of a split mind to SNOW this as an early close and move it back or to promote it, per my BOLD removal of the Voting sections. As it is, i've decided to let it run it's course as doing anything else would not be fair imo, and furthermore unlike GA there will be no overlap of multiple articles at voting - i.e. when this is finished there won't have been any more started. So, whoever closes this, please also remove the Voting section when you are done. Thanks! 23:34, 29 August 2009 (UTC) <br>

No man's land

No man's land is land that is not part of any country. More precisely, it is an area that is under dispute and not occupied because of fear or uncertainty. During war (especially World War I), it is a term used for the area of land between two enemy trenches. Neither side wanted to openly move on or take control of because they feared being attacked by the enemy in the process. 

It is also a term for the stretch of land between two border posts. A person is in no man's land when one exits one country at their border post and then enters the next country at their border post, usually just a few meters away.

<doc id="180934" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=180934" title="Lohengrin (opera)">
Lohengrin (opera)

Lohengrin is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner. Wagner wrote both the words and the music. The story comes from an old German legend.

Some of the music has become very famous, especially the music from Act III where Elsa & Lohengrin enter the bridal chamber. This music is called the "Bridal Chorus". It is also popularly known as "Here comes the Bride". It is very often played on the organ at the beginning of weddings.

"Lohengrin" is a story written by an unknown German author. It is related to other stories that belong to the Knight of the Swan tradition.

Wagner’s opera is like a fairy tale. It immediately became very popular. The young King Ludwig II of Bavaria built a fairy-tale castle in the south of Germany and called it "Neuschwanstein," meaning: “New Swan Stone”. The King was very fond of Wagner’s music and gave him a lot of money to help him with his next operas, especially for the cycle known as the "Ring of the Nibelung". 

It was first performed in Weimar, Germany on 28 August 1850 with Franz Liszt conducting. Liszt chose to conduct it on that particular day because 28 August was the birthday of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe who had lived in Weimar.

Wagner did not hear the first performance. In May 1849 he had run away from Germany because he had been involved in a revolution. He fled to Switzerland. He did not hear his opera "Lohengrin" until 15 May 1861 when he saw a performance in Vienna.

The opera starts with a prelude played by the orchestra. It describes an angel coming down from the sky with the Holy Grail. 

King Henry the Fowler has arrived in Brabant. He is sitting by the banks of the river Scheldt. Around him are Counts and nobles of the Saxon army. Opposite them are Counts and nobles of Brabant. King Henry explains that he had been fighting Hungarians who came to invade his country. They had agreed not to fight for nine years, but these nine years were now coming to an end and his men would have to fight again. The King wants the Brabantines to help them. He asks one of their bravest knights, Friedrich von Telramund, to explain why the Brabantines are arguing amongst themselves.

Count Telramund explains that the Duke of Brabant had recently died. As he lay dying, he had asked Telramund to look after his daughter Elsa and his son Gottfried. One day the two children had gone into the forest and Elsa had returned alone. The Duke tried to find out what had happened to Gottfried. The Duke’s wife Ortrud persuades the Duke to accuse Elsa of murdering her brother. The duke then makes himself the king of Brabant.

Elsa knows that she is innocent and asks God to be her judge. She needs a knight to fight for her. Telramund agrees to fight him.

The second time that the Herald calls the unknown knight, a miracle happens. A boat, pulled by a swan, appears. A knight in shining armour stands in the boat. He gets out of the boat, tells the swan that it can go, and then he greets the king. He asks Elsa if he can be her knight. Elsa kneels in front of him and asks for his help. He says that he will serve her, but he asks one thing: that she should never ask him what his name is or where he comes from. Elsa agrees. Everyone, except for Ortrud, prays and the fight starts. The unknown knight wins, but then he spares Telramund’s life. The unknown knight now takes Elsa’s hand and asks her to marry him.

The action takes place in the courtyard outside the cathedral. It is night. Telramund and Ortrud have been told to go away. Ortrud is a heathen witch, the daughter of Radbod, the Duke of Frisia. She tries to make Telramund brave again. She is going to persuade Elsa to ask the unknown knight what is name is. 

When Elsa comes onto the balcony in the morning she sees Ortrud and feels sorry for her. An announcement is made that the king has decided to give the unnamed knight the title of Duke of Brabant. He says he does not want the title, and prefers to be known just as "Guardian of Brabant." 

The King, the Knight, Elsa and her attendants are about to go into the church. Ortrud, beautifully dressed, appears and says that the knight is a magician. Telramund appears and says that the result of the fight he had did not count, because the knight has not told his name. The knight still refuses to tell his name.

The bedroom of the young couple. Elsa and her new husband enter to the well-known music called the Bridal Chorus. The couple say they love one another. However, Elsa still remembers how Ortrud was pressing her to ask the Knight his name. She asks him who he is. Telramund and four of his friends rush into the room to attack the knight, but Telramund is killed instead. The Knight is very sad and tells Elsa they will now go to the King and he will tell him who he is.

The scene changes to the banks of the river, as in Act I. The army is ready for war. Telramund’s dead body is carried in. The Knight explains why he killed Telramund. He tells the story of the Holy Grail and says that he is Lohengrin, Knight of the Holy Grail and son of King Parsifal. He says that he now has to return to his home. He had only stayed so long so that he could prove that Elsa was innocent. 

Sadly he says goodbye to his young wife. The swan comes again. Lohengrin prays that Elsa may get her lost brother back. The swan dives into the river and appears again in the form of Gottfried, Elsa’s brother. He had been turned into a swan by the evil magic of Ortrud.

A dove comes down from heaven, and takes the place of the swan at the head of the boat. It takes Lohengrin to the castle of the Holy Grail. Elsa is so upset that she dies.

"Wagner Nights" by Ernest Newman (1949)

Erik the Red

Erik the Red (950–c. 1003) (Old Norse: Eiríkr rauði; ; ; ; ; ) founded the first Nordic settlement in Greenland. He was born in the Jæren district of Rogaland, Norway, as the son of Þorvaldr Ásvaldsson (Thorvald Asvaldsson). He therefore also appears, patronymically, as Erik Thorvaldsson (or as Eiríkr Þorvaldsson). The appellation "the Red" most likely refers to his hair color.

March 11, 2004 Madrid attacks

The 11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings (also known as 3/11 and in Spanish as 11-M) consisted of a series of coordinated bombings against the Cercanías (commuter train) system of Madrid, Spain on the morning of 11 March 2004 (three days before Spain's general elections), killing 191 people and wounding 1,800.

Tibooburra, New South Wales

Tibooburra is a small village in the north west corner of New South Wales, Australia. It is from the state capital, Sydney. In 2006 there were 161 people living at Tibooburra. Tibooburra is the hottest place in New South Wales. The name "Tibooburra" comes from the indigenous Australian word for "place of granites."

Tibooburra is a small and very remote town, but fuel, meals and several different places to stay are available. It is north of Broken Hill, New South Wales.

New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service have an Information Centre in the town. There is also a police station.

Explorer Charles Sturt was one of the first Europeans to visit the area in 1844. He spent six months trapped by drought at Depot Glen, south of Tiboorburra. He then tried to travel north west but was stopped by the desert. Burke and Wills also went through the area in 1861 on their journey north towards the Gulf of Carpentaria. It was the search for Burke and Wills that led to the opening up of the country for the farming and grazing. 

The town began during the gold rush to the nearby "Albert Goldfields". Gold was found in the area around Tibooburra in the 1880s. The town was first called called "The Granites". Many of the buildings are built from stone, such as the courthouse built in 1888.

Australian artist Clifton Pugh was often stayed at the Family Hotel (1882) in Tibooburra. He painted a number of murals, drawings and sketches on the inside wall of the hotel.

The main tourist attraction is Sturt National Park, and Cameron's Corner, where the border lines of the states of Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales meet. Cameron's Corner has a hotel which also has fuel and some basic accommodation. 

Tibooburra has a dry, hot, desert climate with temperatures above 40° Celsius (104 °F) in summer, often reaching as high as 47 °C (117 °F). Temperatures are milder in winter, about 20 °C (68 °F) in the daytime. Tibooburra is the hottest town in New South Wales. There is little rainfall during the year. In March 1949 and January 1974, the town received around or twice its average annual rainfall. In its driest year of 1940, only fell for the whole year.

Tibooburra Outback School of the Air is the town's only school, teaching both local children and the children of property owners in the area. It started as a Distance Education Centre in 1991. Before this, children on properties were educated through central schools in towns such as Broken Hill. The school was begun in 1886. No high school exists in the town. Children travel to the nearest high school, do home school, or attend boarding schools.

Three or four times each year, students from distant properties attend a 'mini-school' at the school. Mini-schools usually have themes (such as pirates or the circus) and have of a range of fun and educational activities. Out of town families also receive two home visits a year, in which a teacher (or teachers) and students visit and spend the day on the property.

In 2004 the school changed from radio based education to the Satellite Education Program.

Helmeted honeyeater

The Helmeted honeyeater, "Lichenostomus melanops cassidix", is an endangered species of bird. It is the only species of bird found only in Victoria, Australia. The Helmeted honeyeater became the state of Victoria's official bird emblem in 1971.

Famous ornithologist, John Gould first described the bird as being a separate species, which he named "Ptilotis cassidix" in 1867. It now one of the three sub-species of the Yellow-tufted honeyeater, "Lichenostomus melanops". The other sub species are not endangered.

This bird is only found in a five km long patch of forest along two streams in the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve, 50 km east of Melbourne. A reserve was set up in the Bunyip State Park for releasing birds raised in captivity. In 2003 there were 103 individuals in the wild with 20 breeding pairs known as well as a further 34 birds in captivity at the Healesville Sanctuary. The 2009 Victorian bushfires burnt to within 200 metres of bird colony at Bunyip State Park. Captive birds had to be moved to the Melbourne Zoo when the fires also came close to the Healesville Sanctuary. However, on April 28, 2009, 13 birds bred in captivity were released back into the wild. The number of wild birds is now believed to be 113.

Before the captive breeding program was started there were only about 50—60 birds left in the wild. The birds have been bred at Healesville and at Sydney's Taronga Park Zoo.

The Helmeted honeyeater is about long. Their colour can be anywhere from black to olive green. They have a yellow patch on the heads.

Helmeted honeyeaters eat manna, which is like a sap from some eucalyptus trees. They also eat nectar from the eucalypt flowers as well as small insects and spiders.

Several things are being done to save this bird from becoming extinct. One is a captive breeding program, where the birds are bred at Healesville and Toronga Park. When they become old enough, between 6—8 months, the are put into the wild where they will hopefully begin breeding. Forest areas are being planted with the right sort of trees and plants to provide the birds with food and shelter. This is being done on private land as well as in the State parks. There is also planting to join the small patches of bush with corridors so the birds are not trapped in one small area.

Arch Coal

Arch Coal, Inc. is the second-largest coal producer in the United States, claiming to hold 12% of America’s coal supply (140 million tons in 2005). The company's mines are located in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Virginia. The corporate headquarters are in St. Louis, Missouri.
The company claims a large reserve of coal that hasn't been mined yet, totaling 3.1 billion tons of mostly low-sulfur coal. 

Arch Coal shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ACI.

Arch Mineral Corporation began in 1969, as a partnership between Ashland Oil (now Ashland, Inc.) and the Hunt family of Dallas. Arch Coal was formed in July 1997 when the privately held Arch Mineral merged with the publicly traded Ashland Coal, Inc., which had been formed in 1975 as a subsidiary of Ashland Oil.

In June 1998, Arch Coal purchased the coal fields and mines of the Atlantic Richfield company, which were mostly in the central Rocky Mountains.

National Fuel Gas


National Fuel Gas was incorporated in 1902 and is based in Williamsville, New York.

The Utility division sells natural gas or moves natural gas from one part of the country to another. The Pipeline and Storage division provides interstate natural gas transportation and storage services for related and non-related companies. The Exploration and Production division prospects for and extracts natural gas and oil from the ground. The Energy Marketing division markets natural gas to industrial, commercial, government, and residential customers. The Timber division markets wood from its New York and Pennsylvania forests, and it owns two sawmills in northwestern Pennsylvania, to cut wood into useful sizes and treat it with chemicals to make it last longer.

National Fuel Gas was one of the first gas utility companies in the United States, and so they have been the first to create some new technologies. Engineers at the company discovered that empty underground gas fields could be used to store gas that has been taken from the ground somewhere else. Thus, the first such storage facility in the US was set up at Zoar Field, about forty miles south of Buffalo. This turned out to be a good financial decision for NFG in the 1940s and 50s, when increased demand for natural gas led to long pipelines in the eastern states being connected to new pipelines and fields in the southwestern states. NFG could then buy huge amounts of cheaper summer gas from the southwest, pipe it to the New York storage fields, pump it down into the ground, then take it back out when demand and prices went up in the winter months. 

The company was also the first in the industry to make a gas-fired generator to electrify pipelines so they wouldn't corrode so much. (Natural gas can eat away at metal, over time.)

In 1975, with the introduction of "Balanced Billing", the company claimed that it was "the only gas utility in the country" with a flexible plan for customers to pay bills in eleven equal monthly payments, with settlement of any overpayment or underpayment in the twelfth month. This is a sort of system of installment credit.

National Fuel Gas Co. is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol NFG. Its fiscal year ends September 30.

Isomorphism

In abstract algebra, an isomorphism can be thought of as a function that preserves sets and the relations among their elements. Formally an isomorphism between two groups is a bijective (one-to-one and onto) map φ that preserves the group operation. That is, for x and y elements of a group G, φ(xy) = φ(x)φ(y). 

As an example, consider the group Z of integers under ordinary addition, and the function φ(x) = 2x which maps elements of Z to elements of the even integers 2Z, since φ(ab) = 2(ab) = 2a2b = φ(a)φ(b), this is an example of an isomorphism that is also an automorphism (an isomorphism from a set of elements onto itself).

Group Center

In abstract algebra the center of a group G denoted by Z(G) is the set of elements which commute with every element of G, meaning that for any element x of a group G, and an element y of Z(G), xy = yx. The center is equal to the intersection of the centralizers of the group elements. 

The notation Z(G) comes from the fact that in German the word for center is "zentrum".

Caroline of Ansbach

Caroline of Ansbach was the Queen Consort of the Kingdom of Great Britain during the reign of her husband George II of Great Britain. During her time as Queen she had a lot of power.
Caroline of Ansbach was born Ansbach in Germany, the daughter of Johann Friedrich, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, and his second wife, Princess Eleanor Erdmuthe Louise of Saxe-Eisenach. Orphaned at an early age, Caroline grew up an intelligent, cultured and attractive woman, and was much sought-after as a bride.

She turned down the King of Spain because it would cause her to turn renounce the Protestant faith. Shortly after she met the son of the elector of Hanover They married in 1705. Over the next 30 years they had nine children.
George I of Great Britain died 11 June 1727. George Augustus ascended the throne as George II of Great Britain. Caroline held George on a string. When the Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole met with the King he and Caroline had signs to communicate with each other. George never noticed.

Both the King and Queen truly disliked their eldest son the Prince of Wales. Caroline once called him the Greatest Ass the world has ever known. They preferred Prince William, Duke of Cumberland over Fredrick.

Caroline died 20 November 1737. George was at her side. Caroline asked him to remarry on her deathbed, to which he replied "No, I shall only have mistresses" or in French, "Non, j'aurai seulement des maîtresses!" in tears.

George had Caroline buried in Westminster Abbey. He bought two coffins with removable sides, so after he died they would lie together again.
Caroline's nine pregnancies (from 1707-1724) resulted in eight live births - one of whom, Prince George William (13 November 1717-17 February 1718), died in infancy, and seven of whom lived to adulthood:
Caroline alongside Prince Albert, and Mary of Modena is regarded one of the most powerful British consorts in History.

Template:Start-date/doc

Start-date (birth-date) and end-date (death-date) are easy to read "plain text" date and time templates that emit microformat dates for events. These templates are an alternative to the / and / templates that also emit microformats but require dates to be expressed in a special number oriented syntax. "Fuzzy" dates and times are supported. For events where the precise time, day or month is not known, the user may omit these details. Time zones are assumed to be local to the event. If time zone information is specified, the otherwise optional timezone parameter must be set. 

For the years 99 BC to 99AD especially, microformats may not be emitted properly unless expressed in the form YYYY-MM-DD. For users uninterested in microformats, it should be noted that this restriction has no known impacts other than microformat data which are currently invisible to users. The user of course may express the display form in the second parameter however they would like. Example: 1-2-3 is interpreted as February 3, 1 A.D, and emitted in that form via microformats when the user may have intended something else. Other 3 digit years may be misinterpreted as well, so best practice is to use leading zeros to make a 4 digit year for this date range. For example, February 274 will be interpreted as February 27, 2004. Instead, use "February 0274". Background: There is a good rationale for the behavior of the system function which actually does the hard work of this template. It is very unusual for people to mention such dates so long ago, so when we really mean this date, we must specify a 4 digit date. Outside of this period with ambiguous years, users may use free text dates without this restriction. Bot runs may make a conversion of non 4 digit years to 4 digits (with leading zeros) in order to refine Wikipedia's quality of microformat dates. These changes will not affect display, but for those curious, this is the rationale for such bot manipulations. 

Most time zone abbreviations as well as a large number of place names are recognized. (See .)

Function: Helper function for and . This template is of interest to template writers only. This template emits a dtstart or dtend date sequence as decribed by the hcalendar spec at the microformats community site.

Overview/Vision The main reason for existence of this template is to expose dates associated with events or people to the internet. The standards are called Microformats, and the next major release of browsers such as internet explorer and Firefox are said to allow use of this information. For example, with address or coordinate data, map icons will activate on the toolbar so that the user may see a satellite image of a place discussed in an article. Historical data might be used by a sort of google earth history- where the user can navigate not just in space, but in time. Human readable encoding of dates will make such data ubiquitous in Wikipedia, establishing it the central repository and preeminent source of semantic information on the web.

See Firefox's free Operator toolbar. Check options for debug mode. There is a nice dialog to see the emitted html and the microformats that are recognized.

Label (philately)

Label , or coupon, or tab in philately is a part of sheet of stamps separated from them with perforation (or narrow white margin in imperforate stamps). It cannot be used for postage because it does not have face value and any indication of a postal administration that issued such stamps with labels. The notion of label should not be messed up with the term 'gutter' or with a margin of a stamp sheet.

Sometimes, label is also a stamp-like adhesive of no postal value, often used for promotional purposes.

Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)

The Rainbow flag of LGBT movement is the official flag of LGBT (Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, Transsexual) movement.

The flag has six stripes with the colors of rainbow, red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple.

In 1978, Gilbert Baker of San Francisco designed and made a flag with six stripes representing the six colors of the rainbow as a symbol of gay and lesbian community pride. Slowly the flag took hold, offering a colorful and optimistic alternative to the more common pink triangle symbol. Today it is recognized by the International Congress of Flag Makers, and is flown in lesbian and gay pride marches worldwide. In 1989, the rainbow flag received nationwide attention after John Stout successfully sued his landlords in West Hollywood, when they prohibited him from displaying the flag from his apartment balcony. Meanwhile, Baker is still in San Francisco, and still making more flags.

Program specification

In computer science, a program specification is the definition of what a computer program is expected to do. It can be informal, in which case it can be considered as a blueprint or user manual from a developer point of view, or formal, in which case it has a definite meaning defined in mathematical or programmatic terms. In practice, most successful specifications are written to understand and fine-tune applications that were already well-developed, although safety-critical software systems are often carefully specified prior to application development. Specifications are most important for external interfaces that must remain stable.

In systems engineering a specification is a document that clearly and accurately describes the essential technical requirements for items, materials, or services including the procedures by which it can be determined that the requirements have been met. Specifications help avoid duplication and inconsistencies, allow for accurate estimates of necessary work and resources, act as a negotiation and reference document for engineering changes, provide documentation of configuration, and allow for consistent communication among those responsible for the eight primary functions of Systems Engineering. They provide a precise idea of the problem to be solved so that they can efficiently design the system and estimate the cost of design alternatives. They provide guidance to testers for verification (qualification) of each technical requirement.

In computer science, debugging is the process of finding (and correcting) errors in a computer program. If we think that the program may have an error, we must debug the program in order to find the error. If we find an error, then we must try to correct it, so that the program will then work correctly.

Hubble's Law is a law of cosmology. It was suggested by Edwin Hubble, an American astronomer. 

Hubble confirmed that there were other galaxies further away than the Milky Way. Hubble's Law states that "the degree of redshift from a galaxy's light spectrum is in proportion to its distance from Earth". This redshift is a kind of Doppler effect, which had been discovered by another scientist before Hubble.

Hubble's law is important because it shows the Universe is expanding.

The show is about a teenage detective named Shiniji Kudo, who is poisoned by an evil group called "The Black Organization". The poison was supposed to kill him. However, the poison instead turned him into a small child. Shiniji adopts a new identity as "Conan Edogawa", and lives with his girlfriend, Ran Mouri, and her father, Detective Kogorou Mouri, under the pretense that his parents are away and unable to take care of him. As a child, Shiniji/Conan helps Kogorou solve murder cases, while trying to find the evil men who poisoned him, to steal the poison and create an antidote.

Ma'loula

Ma'loula (, "Ma‘lūlā", from the Aramaic word ܡܥܠܐ, "ma‘lā", meaning 'entrance') is a town in Syria dominated by speakers of Western Neo-Aramaic. With two other nearby towns Bakh'a and Jubb'adin , it is the only place where the Western branch of the Aramaic languages is still spoken. The town is located 56 km to the northeast of Damascus, and built into the rugged mountainside, at an altitude of more than 1500 meters. The distance and geological features only aided the longevity of this linguistic oasis for over one and half thousand years. However, modern roads and transportation, as well as accessibility to Arabic-language television and print media - and for some time until recently, also state policy - have eroded that linguistic heritage. As of 2005, the town has a population of 2,000.

Religiously, the population consists of both Christians and Muslims. For the Muslim inhabitants, the legacy is all the more remarkable given that they were not Arabized, unlike most other Syrians who like them were Islamized over the centuries but also adopted Arabic and shifted to an "Arab" ethnic identity.

Most people go on to assume that people in the Middle-East are Arab. While the majority are and that Arabic is the official language-there are groups in "Arab" countries that have a clearly distinct culture. These people are united by a common language and usually church such as the Syriac Orthodox Church-in the case of Aramaics. These Aramaics are not Arab but have actually dwelled in Syria thousands of years before the Arabs came along. They decended from Assur and are also known as the Assyrians(Assyrian Empire). While a lot of them have turned to speak Arabic-they retain an identity and some-what of the language which they use in church fellowship.

When it comes to other matters such as food for example, both cultures do share similarity.

George Szell

George Szell (pronounced: “sell”) (born Budapest, 7 June 1897; died Cleveland, 30 July 1970) was a famous conductor. He was born Hungarian and became a naturalized American. He is particularly remembered for his work with the Cleveland Orchestra which he made into one of the world’s finest orchestras.

George (originally “Georg”) Szell was born in Hungary and grew up in Vienna, Austria. His music teachers included Mandyczewski, who had been a friend of Brahms, and Max Reger who taught him composition. He was an excellent pianist and was only 11 when he first performed in public, playing one of his own compositions. He started touring Europe. He was only 16 when he conducted the Vienna State Orchestra and 17 when he appeared with the Berlin Philharmonic, both as pianist and conducting his own music.

Szell soon realized that what he wanted to do most was to conduct. He stopped composing, although he kept up his piano playing until the end of his life. Richard Strauss got him some work with the Berlin Staatsoper in 1915. He conducted in several German opera houses, including Darmstadt, Düsseldorf, again in Berlin from 1924-1929 and then Prague (1929-1937). He first conducted in the United States in 1930 with the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra. At this time he was better known as an opera conductor than as a conductor of orchestral concerts.

When World War II started in 1939 Szell was in the U.S. on his way to Europe after having toured Australia. He stayed in the U.S. and settled with his family in New York City. At first he earned a living as a teacher, but he soon began to get invitations to conduct. He conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra in 1941. From 1942 he often conducted the Metropolitan Opera, and the following year he appeared with the New York Philharmonic. In 1946 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

In 1946 Szell got the job he was to keep for the rest of his life: Music Director of the Cleveland Orchestra. This orchestra had suffered because of the war and needed someone strong to turn it into a good orchestra. Szell agreed to do this so long as they always did exactly what he wanted.

Szell was a very strict conductor. In rehearsals he made them work very hard at every tiny detail. Like Toscanini, he was absolutely ruthless. If he thought that a musician had made some mistakes, that musician would be fired (lose his job). If anyone questioned what Szell was doing he would be fired. He even showed the cleaner the proper way to mop the floor.

By the end of the 1950s the Cleveland Orchestra had become famous for its precise playing. It had become one of the greatest orchestras in America and Europe. They toured in the U.S. and to Europe, the Soviet Union, Australia and Japan. 

Szell’s strictness in his conducting was well known. He was, however, an excellent musician, and the members of the orchestra who managed to keep their jobs were delighted with the standard of their playing. They said that he praised them when they were good, and did not keep on rehearsing once the piece was perfect. Szell never showed off when conducting, he never made the music sound sentimental. Like Toscanini, he thought that a conductor should do exactly what the composer had written in the score, without adding his own personal feelings to the music. Some critics thought that his Mozart sounded a bit too lacking in feeling, but Szell said “I cannot pour chocolate sauce over asparagus”. He conducted music by the main central-European composers: Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Schumann and Brahms, Bruckner, Mahler and Strauss. He also conducted some modern music, particularly by Dutilleux, Walton, Prokofiev, Hindemith and Bartók. He encouraged Pierre Boulez to conduct the Cleveland Orchestra.

After World War II Szell often conducted other famous orchestras, including the Concertgebouw Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Philharmonic, the New York Philharmonic and at the Salzburg Festival.

Szell married Olga Band in 1920. They were divorced in 1926. In 1938 he married Helene Schultz Teltsch. Their marriage lasted until his death.

When Szell was not working he enjoyed cooking. He also liked driving cars. Although he could have been driven to his concerts by a chauffeur, he often preferred to drive his Cadillac himself.

He died in Cleveland, Ohio in 1970.

History of Vietnam

The history of Vietnam begins around 2,700 years ago. Successive dynasties based in China ruled Vietnam directly for most of the period from 207 BC until 938 when Vietnam regained its independence. Vietnam remained a tributary state to its larger neighbor China for much of its history but repelled invasions by the Chinese as well as three invasions by the Mongols between 1255 and 1285. Emperor Trần Nhân Tông later diplomatically submitted Vietnam to a tributary of the Yuan to avoid further conflicts. The independent period temporarily ended in the middle to late 19th century, when the country was colonized by France (see French Indochina). During World War II, Imperial Japan expelled the French to occupy Vietnam, though they retained French administrators during their occupation. After the war, France attempted to re-establish its colonial rule but ultimately failed in the First Indochina War. The Geneva Accords partitioned the country in two with a promise of democratic election to reunite the country.
However, rather than peaceful reunification, partition led to the Vietnam War. During this time, the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union supported the North while the United States supported the South. After millions of Vietnamese deaths, the war ended with the fall of Saigon to the North in April 1975. The reunified Vietnam suffered further internal repression and was isolated internationally due to the continuing Cold War and the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. In 1986, the Communist Party of Vietnam changed its economic policy and began reforms of the private sector similar to those in China. Since the mid-1980s, Vietnam has enjoyed substantial economic growth and some reduction in political repression, though reports of corruption have also risen.

Evidence of the earliest established society other than the prehistoric Iron Age Đông Sơn culture in Northern Vietnam was found in Cổ Loa, an ancient city situated near present-day Hà Nội. 

According to myth, the first Vietnamese people were descended from the Dragon Lord Lạc Long Quân and the Immortal Fairy Âu Cơ. Lạc Long Quân and Âu Cơ had 100 sons before deciding to part ways. 50 of the children went with their mother to the mountains, and the other 50 went with their father to the sea. The eldest son became the first in a line of early Vietnamese kings, collectively known as the Hùng kings (Hùng Vương or the Hồng Bàng Dynasty). The Hùng kings called their country, located on the Red River delta in present-day northern Vietnam, Văn Lang. The people of Văn Lang were known as the Lạc Việt.

Bit sudden I feel. I've taken this to AN in a frail attempt to get some consensus, not to cause drama (although it's probably inevitable). Go ahead, discurse. 21:45, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

As many of you might have noticed, 's behavior has become increasingly troubling as of late. I'll try to keep this post short, but here are a couple examples: widespread POV-pushing, demonstrated here and here, which has led to disruption such as edit warring; incivility and inappropriate conduct: ; long, checkered history, both here and at enwiki. At the moment, his problematic behavior is, in my opinion, detrimental to the encyclopedia, and I'd like to propose that some sort of action be taken, whether it be editing restrictions or simply a formal warning. Regards, – |  23:41, 22 April 2009 (UTC)
I have publically insisted this before: Wikipedia should be fun. We all enjoy editing here. Its not a job, we decide ourselves whether or not to edit. The moment I stop enjoying editing here, then I'm leaving. However, the fun can only go so far before it becomes annoying and useless. is a prime example of taking fun too far, and "harms" the wikipedia. I don't know whether or not I'd support a block/ban whatever. I'd like to see a formal proposal before I decide. () 08:03, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
"(<-- reset)" Just thought i'd give my £0.02 on this. I've been watching CM16 for a while, and have mentioned things to other editors about editing habits etc. While there are (possibly) questionable blips I don't think that at this stage there is any need for any form of topic ban etc. Furthermore, I see no "final warning" to CM about his work. Yes, he is blocked at en, but so what? He has proven to be (largely) useful and constructive here, so why "punish" him because of it? Now, I am an out-and-out atheist when it comes to religion, but I respect CMs views and see no reason that we should "punish" him because of them - nor do we have any right to do so. Yes, he may be a bit open and (slightly) POV pushy about it, and the onus is on him to think before he speaks and possibly tone down what could be seen by some as a crusade. CM: You commented that you could take a wikibreak. I'd suggest that a few days/weeks may well be a good idea, just to let the atmosphere clear a little. When you return, try to stay away from areas that have been quite heated for you, not necessarily permanantly, but definitely for a few weeks/months. You say you're not a good content creator, but I am sure with a bit of determination and hard work you could get yourself a GA or VGA, with the help from other editors. I'd certainly be willing to help. Try to become active in areas that are largely neglected - why not head over to , or and look over the articles that are suggested there, giving comments if needed? Perhaps help to clerk DYK, by reviewing hooks and then keeping the template updated. Perhaps head "behind the scenes" and work on things that are often neglected by others, such as categorisation, stub sorting etc. If you want any help, just drop me a line, on or off wiki, and i'll be happy to help you out. To finish, I just want to re-iterate one point (and this actually applies to every editor on the wiki): before you save an edit, check it and think; if someone said that to you, would you be offended? Remember there is a real person on the other end of the screen, and they could easily be hurt by what you say. It's hard to detect emotions etc in text, so try to avoid sarcasm etc. Furthermore, remember that other people may not share the same views with you. Try not to push them upon anyone else, and respect other people's opinions. Everyone is entitled to their own, and no-one has the right to alter those views. To be concise, just think before saving. Regards, 11:02, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
I'd oppose the proposal. While I don't believe CM16 should have been allowed to edit Simple after his EN ban, to punt him out or restrict him now would serve no real purpose. A less "in your face" userpage would be nice and without userboxes than border, in the eyes of some if not myself, on homophobic () 12:55, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

I would support either a restriction to article space or a formal warning. We keep saying how good an editor he is here etc etc, how he has improved from how he was at en.wiki. But I honesly don't know that he has other that he doesn't sockpuppet anymore, which could be only because he isn't banned here so he doesn't need to. - () 13:57, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
Support a restriction or a ban. His responses here suggest little knowledge of the problem, which in itself is a problem.  () 14:14, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
Suggestion In order to get around banning or limiting CM16's editing abilities, why not get rid of the things that are overly objectionable? I would suggest asking CM16 to rename his account to remove POV, and then deleting his user page and salting it so it can't be recreated. Thoughts? () 12:05, 25 April 2009 (UTC)


 indefinitely blocked by 

I'd like an unblock for ChristianMan16. As far as I know, there has been no discussion on wiki saying that he should be banned. There are even opposes above. It's a serious thing. He has several thousand edits, has been here for nearly two years. I don't understand. 21:52, 1 May 2009 (UTC)





Any english wp edits aren't me, and the one month block seems to have been a year ago anyway. 

Hello all. I'll try to make this brief, as I want to create as little as drama as possible. I agree with others that something needs to be done, as the drama surrounding CM16 has been going on for awhile. The user was indef blocked at present, and I didn't oppose it (on-wiki, at least). I have not seen a single comment that says CM16's mainspace contributions aren't good. It is widely agreed upon that he has been disruptive and/or pushing POV on Simple Talk, user talk pages, RfAs, etc, but look at templates such as (not the template, but the articles in it). None of these would've been created without this user's efforts. I talked to CM16 about this, and he agreed. I'm proposing a six month topic ban, where he cannot edit any pages outside the article space. This will restrict him from creating drama, POV pushing, being disruptive, etc., but will also keep articles (especially related to wrestling) updated and accurate. 04:03, 2 May 2009 (UTC)no



OK, I have interviewed CM16 on Google talk, and thought you people would like to know his thoughts. He:

Hi. Here is a message from CM16.
"Well, my fellow editors, this is it, all I want to say is I too want what's best for the wiki and I believe strongly that for this wiki it includes me, and if you prefer, in a topic ban. Me and SimonKSK are the only two wrestling editors here and he's not here that often. The blocking of me and/or the deletion of those articles I believe would damage the wiki. Now, y'all do not care much for wrestling, but I know millions of people do, and I write them to satisfy them, and I enjoy that. One person suggested they go to a wrestling news side. But the problem there is it's just that a News site, not an encyclopedia of wrestling facts. Now, I'll admit I've done a few things wrong. And I fully intend to improve. All I need from you all is that chance. I know some of you might think I'm an evil little boy trying to hurt the wiki, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. That's my view and request of this. It's up to you. Help or hurt the wiki. TTYL.--CM16"
I do agree - even though I'm not a wrestling fan - that it is important business in the USA, and the articles should exist. He is one of the only people that have the knowledge and will to do it. 20:38, 7 May 2009 (UTC)


Following this announcement on the Wikimedia Technical Blog, the changes to Extension:TorBlock has been made live, with tighter restrictions. In order to counter this problem, all wikis now have the IP block exemption group enabled. It can be added and removed by administrators. If anyone needs it, they can request for the flag over here for now until a seperate page has been created.     08:14, 4 May 2009 (UTC)

ChristianMan16 was indefinitely blocked. A proposal was then made to offer him an unblock with restrictions. That was opposed and the discussion closed as ChristianMan16 being blocked for six months. How is it possible for a block to be shortened (indef to six months) when the consensus was in favour of the initial six-month block? () 08:38, 8 May 2009 (UTC)

This needs to be reworded. CM16 is still "indefinitely banned" right now. It is just that we are allowing the chance to revisit this (if he chooses to request an unblock) in 6 months. The way it is worded now means that he will be unblocked automatically in 6 months. He is community banned indefinitely; in 6 months he may request an unblock. That's the way it is. It is not a community ban of 6 months as Chenzw's wording suggests. 

I must say though, I see absolutely zero consensus to make it a 6 month ban. The 6 month time frame was for his "topic" ban that was proposed if he was unblocked right now. I don't see a single person who suggested "let's reduce his indefinite ban to 6 months." () 10:36, 8 May 2009 (UTC)

Hi,

I'm sure that others are as sick of the Disney Vandal as I am. What about an indef semi-pp of Ja'far, Aladin and the like? It might help stem this issue. Valid anons can always ask for unprotection. 00:30, 6 May 2009 (UTC)
Is it possible to ban anonymizers like http://www.anonymizer.org?-- () 02:26, 6 May 2009 (UTC)
Back to the original question: I think a 1-year block would be sufficient to stop the Disney vandal without forever semi-protecting all Disney related pages. I fear that 2 or 3 years from now, no one will remember why these pages were blocked and they'll always stay that way. I think it's unlikely that an anon would ask for a page to be unprotected, but they'll probably just leave a note on the talk page, asking us to fix whatever mistake they find. Too bad they won't be able to "be bold". 02:55, 6 May 2009 (UTC)
A lot of kids who edit will be start editing the fluffy articles. Let's be honest, kids who haven't graduated high school have no business editing a lot of the articles here. So protecting all Disney articles may put kids off. I'm not ideologically opposed to that, just pointing it out. Majorly's suggestion makes more sense. While IPs on EN do make some useful contributions, they do less so here. () 08:26, 6 May 2009 (UTC)
I'd personally oppose this limited semi-protection but support the move to remove the rights of IP editors to contribute () 12:40, 7 May 2009 (UTC)

I came across , I don't know how appropriate this username is. Additional thoughts? () 17:26, 10 May 2009 (UTC)
...is a banned user on en.wiki if I am correct? In accordance with our new tough line on these people, what do people think of Thekohser‎ editing here? He (so far) does not seem to be helping with editing here, instead concentrating on picking up "mistakes". Perhaps enforcing the ban from en.wiki here could be a good idea? Thoughts? () 11:37, 1 May 2009 (UTC)
At the time of this post, Thekohser has 31 total edits since he joined 4 days ago. Of those edits: 
I feel that his pattern of edits is not benefiting our project and is, in fact, wasting our time. Unless there is some indication that this user will begin contributing meaningfully to the article space, I agree with Kennedy's proposal. 13:40, 1 May 2009 (UTC)
Oppose ban. Would be counter-productive to the extreme. Look, Razorflame's behaviour on Yahoo Answers was not particularly impressive, and while we can't stop editors doing what they want on other sites, it does mean we should extend some leeway to Thekohser. A ban would be highly productive. If you lot stopped goading Greg, and took a step back, I doubt there would be a problem. () 14:57, 1 May 2009 (UTC)




I won't support this at this time. Bans are not/should not be reciprocated except in the most grave of circumstances. No hunts please. () 17:42, 10 May 2009 (UTC)


I think everyone's had a chance to voice their opinions and it looks like there is no good reason to block at this time. I'm going to consider this discussion closed. Feel free to open a new one if there is a good reason for it. 16:49, 12 May 2009 (UTC)
Could someone protect Darius Danesh as it has been receiving a lot of vandalism adding the same nonsense. Possibly 2 weeks as it was protected before I think...? 11:50, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont

Adelheid Emma Wilhelmina Theresia (Arolsen, 2 August 1858 – Den Haag, 20 March 1934), Princess of Orange-Nassau, Princess of Waldeck-Pyrmont, was the second wife of king William III of the Netherlands. She was married to him from 1879 until he died in 1890. After his death, she became Queen-Regent of the Netherlands because her daughter Wilhelmina was only 10 when her father died, and too young to become queen.

Emma was the fourth of seven children. Her father was George Victor, king of Waldeck and Pyrmont, and her mother was Helena, Princess of Nassau-Weilburg. Her grandmother on her father's side, Emma of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym, was a grandchild of princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau and Karel Christiaan of Nassau-Weilburg. Her grandfather on her mother's side, Willem of Nassau-Weilburg, was also their grandchild. This means that Emma was related to the House of Orange-Nassau through two family connections. 

The princess grew up in Schloss Arolsen in Germany. Her daughter, the later Queen Wilhelmina wrote in her autobiography that her mother's home life was very modern and well informed for that time.

The king was married before, to his cousin Sophie of Württemberg. She died in 1877. Their marriage was unhappy, they had lived apart since 1855. William III had a few relationships outside his first marriage. The newspapers even reported on his relationships with the American barmaid Elisa Parker and the opera singer Leonora d'Ambre from Paris. 

After Sophie died, and the sons did not marry anyone, William thought it best to re-marry. That way, the family name of Orange would not die out. He met Sophie after going to her house to meet her older sister Pauline. He had also looked into marrying his niece Elisabeth van Saksen-Weimar-Eisenach. 

When they were engaged in September 1878, Emma was 20 years old, and William was 61. They married on 7 January 1879, and on 31 August 1880, Wilhelmina was born. 

The first years of the marriage were happy for Queen Emma. She liked to do woodcarving, and spent a lot of time in her workshop in Utrecht. She also spent a lot of time on taking care of her "Wimmy" . But soon things changed. In 1884, William's youngest son Alexander died. He was 32 years old, and was not married. William's other sons had already died: Maurits in 1850 age 6, and William in 1879 aged 38. This meant that princess Wilhelmina would now be next in line to become Queen. 

The princess was only three years old. The King was 65. Because of the age difference, the government voted for Emma to become "Regent". This meant that if the king died before Wilhelmina was 18 years old, Emma would do the job of Queen until Wilhelmina was old enough to take over. 

The health of the King went downhill fast in 1888. In May the family moved from The Hague to their palace in the quiet of Apeldoorn. The king could no longer rule the country. The government voted that Queen Emma would be Regent, and she took the oath to rule for her husband on 20 november in The Hague. She only ruled in his place for three days, William died on 23rd November 1890. He was 73 years old. From that day, at 10 years old, Wilhelmina officially became the Queen. Emma became Queen-regent for her daughter until 1898. 

Emma worked in the same way as her husband. She made sure she would meet all ministers once every fourteen days. Unlike her husband, she opened up for everyone who wanted to speak to her. She also opened a lot of the post that was sent to her personally. In her period as Queen-widow-regent, she had to reshuffle her cabinet three times. She found this a difficult task. 

She also gave great care to raising her daughter. She wanted to make sure her daughter would be ready to be the queen.

Young Wilhelmina soon chose her own path when she became Queen. She tried to get away from her mother, but often had to rely on her good knowledge of protocol. At first they lived together in Palace Noordeinde. When Wilhelmina married, Emma moved to Palace Lange Voorhout. She was no longer involved in reigning the country but still would receive diplomats and other people as widow of the king.

She supported the work to stop tuberculosis, which was a disease many people died from at the time. Her sister Sophie had died from it too.

The next in line to the throne, Juliana, was born in 1909. The government again looked for a regent. They did not think Wilhelmina's husband Hendrik was good. Because they had good memories of Emma as regent, they requested that Emma again be Regent. Wilhelmina agreed, and from 1909 to 1927 (when Juliana would be 18) Emma once again was regent. This time it was not needed. 

Emma died on 20th March 1934 from the complications of bronchitis.

Dajabón River

The River Dajabón is a river in the northern side of the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic. It is 55 km long and flows to the north into the Manzanillo Bay, Atlantic Ocean.

The Taíno name of the river was "Guatapaná" but the Spanish people that came to live in the Hispaniola island called it Dajabón after the Taíno name of the region ("Dahaboon"). Because this river was the border between the two colonies of the island, there were many fights during the 16th and 17th centuries and many people died here; then the French people began to name the river Massacre, written sometimes Masacre in Spanish; massacre means the killing of many people.

The source of the Dajabón is at the "Pico de Gallo" mountain, on the northern side of the Cordillera Central mountain range. It flows through the Dajabón province and then form part of the limits between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Its mouth is in the Manzanillo Bay, on the Atlantic Ocean.

Its discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) is 2.84 cubic metres per second at Don Miguel, a place a few kilometres south of the city of Dajabón.

The city of Dajabón is the most important Dominican city close to the river. It flows also through the city of Loma de Cabrera. The Haitian city of Ouanaminthe is also close to the river.

The most important tributary is the river "Capotillo" (in Haiti, river "Bernard"). There is not any important tributary in the lower part.

The river Capotillo is part of the northern border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic until it joins the river Dajabón between the cities of Loma de Cabrera and Dajabón. Then the border follows the course of the river Dajabón.

Ladies and gents, it's my pleasure to present Djsasso as a candidate for becoming a bureaucrat. DJ's been active here for around nine months, and an admin for almost four. While I've disagreed with him in the past, he has been a very steady admin. He is a source of wisdom in community discussions at both and . On Simple, he has over 2,500 edits, and has created several articles He's also an admin at the I could only see him being a net positive as a bureaucrat, especially since we've lost Kennedy. It also wouldn't hurt to have a bureaucrat in the Americas who would close RfXs when Eptalon, TRM or Vector are asleep or when Chenzw is at school. :-) 00:14, 3 May 2009 (UTC) 

"Candidate's acceptance:" While I will admit some surprise at this nomination as I haven't set out looking for such a position, I will definately accept the nomination for the position as I am always here to try and help and improve the wiki. As Shappy mentions I do have experience both here and on en.wiki as an admin. I have experience closing discussions on both wiki's based on the consensus that has formed and I have no problem closing discussion with the opposite result than the one I might personally want. Shappy is correct in that it could be usefull to have a 'crat in the Americas in order to not only close rfxes but to stop flooding if needed. I would also be able to work with Bot requests since I run a bot myself and have some knowledge of bot coding. - () 01:38, 3 May 2009 (UTC)

Huang Xianfan

Huang Xianfan (13 November 1899, China - 18 January 1982, People's Republic of China) was a Chinese historian, famous scholar and leader of the Bagui School and the Wunu School. He is considered by many to be the "Great Master of Zhuang Ethnic Research" for his writings about the ancient history of Zhuang Ethnic and Baiyue Ethnic.

During three periods of ethnic identification work after 1949, professors Fei Xiaotong, Huang Xianfan, Xia Kangnong and a lot of academic masters and scholars from anthropology and ethnic study circles made their great contributions. It was upon this research work of national ethnic identification that the State Council could be able to announce there are 56 ethnics in China. This was also a pioneering contribution to Chinese ethnic studies. In the mean time,the world ethnic study circles had noticed this and gave a great high comment. This was the reason that ethnic study circles called professor Huang a founder of modern Chinese ethnic studies.

Multiple personality

Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is the name for a mental illness. The disease describes a condition where a person shows many different identities or personalities. These are usually called "alter egos" or "alters". Each of these identities has a different way of interacting with the environment. 

The diagnosis requires that at least two personalities routinely take control of the individual's behavior with an associated memory loss that goes beyond normal forgetfulness; in addition, symptoms cannot be due to drug use or medical condition. Earlier versions of the DSM named the condition multiple personality disorder (MPD), and the term is still used by the ICD-10.

Foreign minister

A foreign minister is a person in a government whose job is to negotiate with leaders in other countries. In some countries, this person is called the foreign minister, but in other countries the person has another title. For example, in the United States, the top diplomat is called the Secretary of State.

A foreign minister's powers vary in different governments. In a general parliamentary system, a foreign minister forms foreign policy. But when the government has a strong prime minister the foreign minister may be may not determine policy himself.

Foreign ministers are also traditionally responsible for many diplomatic duties, such as hosting foreign world leaders. They also are responsible for going on state visits to other countries. The foreign minister is generally person who travels the most in any cabinet.

In the United Kingdom, the foreign minister is called the 'Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs' (or 'Foreign Secretary' for short). Before 1968, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs only handled relations with non-Commonwealth, countries. The relations with Commonwealth countries and colonies were handled by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs. So, in Commonwealth countries other than the United Kingdom, the ministers responsible for handling relations with both Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries were formerly usually designated ministers for 'External Affairs'.

In the United States, the foreign minister is called the 'Secretary of State'. He occupies the oldest cabinet post in the nation. The post originally had several domestic duties. Other common titles may include minister of foreign relations. In many Spanish-Speaking Latin American countries, the foreign minister is colloquially called canciller (chancellor).

Wikipedia:No original research

Wikipedia does not publish original research or original thought. This includes unpublished facts, arguments, speculation, and ideas, as well as any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that serves to advance a position. This means that the place to publish your own opinions, experiences, arguments, or conclusions. 

"No original research" is one of three core content policies. The others are and . Together, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in articles. These three support each other and make a whole. For this reason, they should not be interpreted standing alone, but only together. Editors should familiarize themselves with all three.

Research that consists of collecting and organizing material from existing sources within the provisions of this and other content policies is encouraged: this is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia. Take care, however, not to go beyond what is expressed in the sources or to use them in ways inconsistent with the intent of the source, such as using material out of context. In short, stick to the sources. 

If no reliable third-party sources can be found on an article topic, Wikipedia should not have an article about it. 

Any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged must be supported by a reliable source. Material for which no reliable source can be found is considered original research. The only way you can show that your edit does not come under this category is to produce a reliable published source that contains that same material. Even with well-sourced material, however, if you use it out of context or to advance a position that is not directly and explicitly supported by the source used, you as an editor are engaging in original research; see .

In general the most reliable sources are peer-reviewed journals and books published in university presses; university-level textbooks; magazines, journals, and books published by respected publishing houses; and mainstream newspapers. As a rule of thumb, the more people engaged in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the writing, the more reliable the publication. Material that is self-published, whether on paper or online, is generally not regarded as reliable, but see for exceptions.

If you are able to prove something that few or none currently believe, Wikipedia is not the place to première such a proof. Once a proof has been presented in a reliable source, however, it may be referenced.

Information in an article must be in the references cited. Article statements generally should not rely on unclear or inconsistent passages nor on passing comments. Passages open to multiple interpretations should be precisely cited or avoided. A summary of extensive discussion should reflect the conclusions of the source's author(s). Drawing conclusions not evident in the reference is original research regardless of the type of source. It is important that references be cited in context and on topic.

Wikipedia articles should rely mainly on published reliable secondary sources and, to a lesser extent, on tertiary sources. All interpretive claims, analyses, or synthetic claims about primary sources must be referenced to a secondary source, rather than original analysis of the primary-source material by Wikipedia editors.

For the purposes of Wikipedia policies and guidelines, primary, secondary and tertiary sources are defined as follows:




Unsourced material obtained from a Wikipedian's personal experience, such as an unpublished eyewitness account, should not be added to articles. It would violate both this policy and , and would cause Wikipedia to become a primary source for that material.

Appropriate sourcing can be a complicated issue, and these are general rules. Deciding whether primary, secondary or tertiary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of and good editorial judgment, and should be discussed on article talk pages.

Do not put together information from multiple sources to reach a conclusion that is not stated explicitly by any of the sources.

Editors should not make the mistake of thinking that if A is published by a reliable source, and B is published by a reliable source, then A and B can be joined together in an article to reach conclusion C. This would be a "synthesis" of published material that advances a new position, and that constitutes original research. "A and B, therefore C" is acceptable "only if" a reliable source has published the same argument in relation to the topic of the article.

The following example is based on an actual Wikipedia article about a dispute between two authors, here called Smith and Jones.

Smith claimed that Jones committed plagiarism by copying references from another author's book. Jones responded that it is acceptable scholarly practice to use other people's books to find new references.

Now comes the original synthesis:

If Jones did not consult the original sources, this would be contrary to the practice recommended in the Harvard "Writing with Sources" manual, which requires citation of the source actually consulted. The Harvard manual does not call violating this rule "plagiarism". Instead, plagiarism is defined as using a source's information, ideas, words, or structure without citing them.

The first paragraph was properly sourced. The second paragraph was original research because it expressed the editor's opinion that, given the Harvard manual's definition of plagiarism, Jones did not commit it. To make the second paragraph consistent with this policy, a reliable source would be needed that "specifically" comments on the Smith and Jones dispute and makes the same point about the Harvard manual and plagiarism. In other words, that precise analysis must have been published by a reliable source "in relation to the topic" before it can be published in Wikipedia by a contributor.

Summarizing or rephrasing source material without changing its meaning is not synthesis — it is good editing. Best practice is to write Wikipedia articles by taking material from different reliable sources on the topic and putting those claims on the page in your own words, with each claim attributable to a source that explicitly makes that claim.

This policy does not prohibit editors with specialist knowledge from adding their knowledge to Wikipedia, but it does prohibit them from drawing on their personal knowledge without citing their sources. If an editor has published the results of his or her research in a reliable publication, the editor may cite that source while writing in the third person and complying with our . See also Wikipedia's .

Because of copyright law in a number of countries, there are relatively few existing images publicly available for use in Wikipedia. Photographs, drawings and other images created by Wikipedia editors thus fill a needed role. Wikipedia editors are encouraged to take photographs or draw pictures or diagrams and upload them, releasing them under the GFDL or another free license, to illustrate articles. Original images created by a Wikipedia editor are not usually considered original research – "as long as they do not illustrate or introduce unpublished ideas or arguments", the core reason behind the NOR policy. 

Images that constitute original research in any way are not allowed. It is not acceptable for an editor to use photo manipulation to try to distort the facts or position being illustrated by a contributed photo. Manipulated images should be prominently noted as such. Any image that is found to have manipulation that materially affects its encyclopedic value should be posted to .

Image captions should also follow this policy. Great care should be taken not to introduce original research into an article when captioning images.

Where English translations of non-English material are unavailable, Wikipedia editors may supply their own. If such translations are challenged, editors should cooperate in producing one they can agree on. Copyright restrictions permitting, translations published by reliable sources are preferred over those provided by Wikipedia editors.

This policy does not forbid routine calculations, such as adding numbers, converting units, or calculating a person's age, provided editors that the arithmetic and its application correctly reflect the information published by the from which it is derived.

The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. This policy and the verifiability policy reinforce each other by requiring that only assertions, theories, opinions, and arguments that have already been published in a reliable source may be used in Wikipedia.

The prohibition against original research limits the extent to which editors may present their own points of view in articles. By reinforcing the importance of including verifiable research produced by others, this policy promotes the inclusion of multiple points of view. Consequently, this policy reinforces our neutrality policy. In many cases, there are multiple established views of any given topic. In such cases, no single position, no matter how well researched, is authoritative. It is not the responsibility of any one editor to research "all" points of view. But when incorporating research into an article, it is important that editors provide context for this point of view, by indicating how prevalent the position is, and whether it is held by a majority or minority.

The inclusion of a view that is held only by a tiny minority may constitute original research. Jimbo Wales has said of this:

The word Classicism, in the arts, is used when talking about art movements which admired the Ancient Greeks and Romans and copied ideas from them. The art of classicism often involves a thoughtful approach to the arts in which beauty and form is admired, rather than passion or any kind of exaggeration.

Classicism influenced several periods in European history, especially the Italian Renaissance, Age of Reason, the Age of Enlightenment and some movements in Modernism.

Classicism can apply to painting, sculpture, architecture, music, dance, literature or philosophy.

Police Academy: The Animated Series

Police Academy, also known as Police Academy: The Animated Series, is an popular 1988 american animated television series based on the "Police Academy" series of films. It aired on Saturday mornings and lasted two seasons for a total of 64 episodes.

Some episodes feature a crime boss named Kingpin. His keen intelligence, girth, and stature are very similar to the Marvel Comics character of the same name. New characters were added to the show as well. Among them were a group of talking police dogs called the Canine Corps. They were made up of Samson (the bulldog leader), Lobo (the noble yet clumsy husky), Bonehead (the dimwitted giant St. Bernard), Chilipepper (the excitable chihuahua), and Schitzy (the only female golden retriever with an identity crisis). 

The show was produced by Ruby-Spears Productions and Warner Bros. Animation. In later years, the latter company would gain distribution rights to most of the pre-1990 shows by the former, thanks to Time Warner buying Turner Entertainment (which had acquired the R-S library) in 1996.

The animated serie takes place chronologically between the fourth and fifth film of the series of films.

Twelve characters are re-created for this animated version, including a team of Academy graduates led by Carey Mahoney, a likeable rogue bachelor boy, who unconsciously—and consistently—does his best to make life miserable for Captain Harris and his knucklehead assistant Sgt. Proctor.

Mahoney's friends include the aptly named Moses Hightower, walking sound effects machine Larvell Jones, trigger-happy Eugene Tackleberry, sweet & timid Laverne Hooks, tough-as-nails Debbie Callahan, larger-than-life House, and the bread-&-butter duo of reformed gang member Zed and his best buddy, Sweetchuck.

Eric Lassard is the highly-respected (albeit dreamy) Commandant, and Academy newcomer The Professor is also on hand, and also the cadets new friends, the K-9 Corps, a group of cops dogs, and stocking our crime-fighting heroes with an endless supply of wacky gadgets as they combat a motley crew of Kingpin and other recurring villains such as Numbskull, The Claw, Mr. Sleaze, Lockjaw and Amazona.


"Police Academy" was released through chronological volumes on VHS. At least six volumes were released, each including two episodes. In 2009 on DVD with the complete series.

Tottenham Hale station

Tottenham Hale , is a National Rail and London Underground Victoria Line station in Tottenham, north London. It is on Hale Road near the Tottenham Hale one-way system. The station is in Travelcard Zone 3.

The station opened on 15 September 1840 as Tottenham. It was on the Northern & Eastern Railway (N&ER) line from Stratford in east London to Broxbourne in Hertfordshire.

It was renamed Tottenham Hale on 1 September 1968 when it became an interchange station with London Underground on the opening of the first stage of the Victoria line.

The next station to the south on the line to Liverpool Street is Clapton but very few trains, except on Sundays, serve both Clapton and Tottenham Hale. Most trains either run non-stop between Liverpool Street and Tottenham Hale or make one intermediate stop at Hackney Downs. Clapton is almost exclusively served by trains going via the Chingford branch instead.

From 11 December 2005, a new service between Stratford and Stansted Airport reintroduced a direct passenger connection between Tottenham Hale and Stratford via the mainly freight line across Walthamstow Marshes. Lea Bridge, a former station between Tottenham Hale and Stratford, may be re-opened in the future.

<doc id="181453" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181453" title="P versus NP">
P versus NP

P versus NP is the name of a question that many mathematicians, scientists, and computer programmers want to answer. P and NP are two groups of mathematical problems. P problems are considered "easy" for computers to solve. NP problems are easy only for a computer to check. For example, if you have an NP problem, and someone says "The answer to your problem is 12345," a computer can quickly figure out if the answer is right or wrong, but it may take a very long time for the computer to come up with "12345" on its own.

All P problems are NP problems, because it is easy to check that a solution is correct by solving the problem and comparing the two solutions. However, people want to know about the opposite: Are there any NP problems that are not P problems, or are all NP problems just P problems? If the NP problems are really separate from the P problems, it would mean that no fast and easy ways to solve those NP problems can exist, no matter how hard we look. However if all NP problems are P problems, it would mean that new, very fast problem solving methods do exist, but we haven't found them yet.

Since the best efforts of scientists and mathematicians haven't found the easy methods for solving NP problems yet, many people believe that there are NP problems that are not P problems. Most mathematicians also believe this to be true, but currently no one has proven it by rigorous mathematical analysis. If somehow it is proven that NP and P are the same, it would have a huge impact on many aspects of our life. For this reason the question of P versus NP has become an important and widely studied topic.

Suppose a woman wants to build two towers, by stacking rocks of different mass. She wants to make sure that each of the towers has exactly the same mass. That means she will have to divide the rocks into two piles that have the same mass. If she guesses a division of the rocks that she thinks will work, it would be easy for her to check if she was right. To check her answer, she can divide the rocks into the two piles that she guessed, and then use a scale to see if they have the same mass. Because it is easy to check an answer to see if it is correct, this problem, called 'Partition' by computer scientists, is an NP problem.

If she has just 100 rocks, there are formula_1 possible ways to divide these rocks into two piles. For comparison, physicists believe that the universe is about formula_2 seconds old. That means that if the woman took all of the time that has passed since the beginning of the universe, she would need to check more than formula_3 different ways of dividing the rocks every second, in order to check all of those different ways.

If the woman programmed a powerful computer to test all of these ways to divide the rocks, it might be able to check formula_4 ways per second. This means she would still need formula_5 very powerful computers, working since the beginning of time, to test all the ways of dividing the rocks. However, perhaps it is possible for her to find a method of dividing the rocks into two equal piles without checking all combinations. The question "Is P equal to NP?" asks if any method like that exists.

This question is so important that the Clay Mathematical Institute will give $1,000,000 to anyone who answers it. There are many important NP problems that people don't know how to solve in a way that is faster than testing every possible answer. Here are some examples.






In the example above, we see that with formula_6 rocks, there are formula_7 ways to partition the set of rocks. With formula_8 rocks, there are formula_9 combinations. The function formula_10 is an exponential function. It's important to NP because it models the worst-case number of computations that are needed to solve a problem and, thus, the worst-case amount of time required.

And so far, for the hard problems, the solutions have required on the order of formula_9 computations. For any particular problem, people have found ways to reduce the number of computations needed. One might figure out that a way to do just 1% of the worst-case number of computation and that saves a "lot" of computing, but that is still formula_12 computations. And every extra rock still doubles the number of computations needed to solve the problem. There are insights that can produce methods to do even fewer computations producing variations of the model: e.g. formula_13. But the exponential function still dominates as formula_8 grows.

Consider the problem of scheduling exams (described above). But suppose, next, that there are 15000 students. There's a computer program that takes the schedules of all 15000 students. It runs in an hour and outputs an exam schedule so that all students can do their exams in one week. It satisfies lots of rules (no back-to-back exams, no more than 2 exams in any 28 hour period, ...) to limit the stress of exam week. Student life is good. The program runs for one hour at mid-term break and everyone knows his/her exam schedule with plenty of time to prepare.

The next year, though, there are 10 more students. If the same program runs on the same computer then that one hour is going to turn into formula_15 hours, because every additional student doubles the computations. That's formula_16 weeks! If there were 20 more students, then

Thus, for formula_21 students, it takes one hour. For formula_22 students, it takes formula_20 years.

Mathematicians can show that there are some NP problems that are NP-Complete. An NP-Complete problem is at least as difficult to solve as any other NP problem. This means that if someone found a method to solve any NP-Complete problem quickly, they could use that same method to solve "every" NP problem quickly. All of the problems listed above are NP-Complete, so if the salesman found a way to plan his trip quickly, he could tell the teacher, and she could use that same method to schedule the exams. The farmer could use the same method to determine how many boxes she needs, and the woman could use the same method find a way to build her towers. 

Because a method that quickly solves one of these problems can solve them all, there are many people who want to find one. However, because there are so many different NP-Complete problems and nobody so far has found a way to solve even one of them quickly, most experts believe that is not possible to find the answers to any of them quickly.

Backstreet Boys

Backstreet Boys, also known as BSB, is a pop group that became popular during the 1990s and 2000s. They are considered to be the highest selling boy band of all time due to their several hits that topped the chart and unique charisma to the people. Kevin Richardson left the group in 2006. The remaining four singers are Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, A. J. McLean, and Brian Littrell. The other singer Kevin Richardson left the group to find other things of interest. 
Backstreet Boys originated in Orlando, Florida and was formed on April 20, 1993 by Lou Pearlman with the help of a producer, Lil’ Shy. The original member of the group consists of Howie Dorough (19), AJ McLean (15), Nick Carter (13) and two more departed members, Sam Licata and Charles Edwards. In 1993, Kevin Richardson along with his cousin Brian Littrell completed the group. 

After series of tours and the failure of possible Mercury Records, the Backstreet Boys was finally spotlighted in Cleveland, Ohio by Jive Records in February 1994. They recorded their very first single, “We’ve Got it Goin’, written by Denniz PoP and included in Backstreet Boys’ first self titled album that was released in summer of 1996.

Howie Dorough
"Howard Dwaine Dorough", one of the original members of the Backstreet Boys was born on August 22, 1973 in Orlando Florida, USA. Howie started his entertainment career at a tender age of six when he participated in an Orlando Production, The Wizard of Oz. As he grew old, he became more active in their school choir and theatre. Howie has also performed in various Nickelodeon productions and other movies. 

A. J. McLean
"Alexander James McLean" was born in West Palm Beach, Florida on January 9, 1978. Like Howie Dorough, he was also a product of Nickelodeon and Disney Productions. With huge passion for singing, AJ joined the BSB group after a series of auditions with original co-members, Howie Dorough and Nick Carter.

Nick Carter
"Nickolas Gene Carter" was born in Jamestown, New York on January 28, 1980. Being the youngest member of Backstreet Boys, Nick at his very young age of 12 hit the music industry along with his co-members with his rasping but melodic voice. True artist at heart, he also auditioned in several acting roles and appeared in the popular in 1990, the Edward Scissorhands. Nick together with AJ McLean and Howie Dorough was recruited by Lou Pearlman in his forming group. Nick Carter is the elder brother of singer Aaron Carter.

Kevin Richardson
"Kevin Scott Richardson", a former member of Backstreet Boys was born in Lexington, Kentucky, USA on October 3, 1971. Kevin grew up in a farm with his parents and two siblings. After graduating in high school, Kevin left his family to pursue his dream of becoming an actor and a singer. He along with his older brother went to Orlando, Florida to try his luck. He became a model, tour guide at Walt Disney World and a dance instructor. At age 21, he joined Backstreet Boys and convinced his cousin, Brian Littrell to also join the group. Kevin left the group on January 23, 2006. 

Brian Littrell
"Brian Thomas Littrell" completed the Backstreet Boys group as its fifth member in 1993 after a phone audition to Lou Pearlman. Brian is the cousin of Kevin Richardson, a fellow member of BSB. Born on February 20, 1975 in Lexington, Kentucky USA, Brian began singing as a child in a nearby church. He went to Orlando, Florida and completed the group on April 20,1993.

Crab-eating Frog

The Crab-eating Frog ("Fejervarya cancrivora"), is also known as the Asian Brackish Frog, Mangrove Frog and the Rice Field Frog. It is a frog native to south-eastern Asia including the Philippines and more rarely as far west as Orissa in India. Populations of the frog have been introduced into New Guinea and Guam.

The Crab-eating Frog lives in mangrove forests, in river estuaries, swamps, and other wet areas. It also lives in man-made places like rice fields and roadside ditches.

Guillaume de Machaut

Guillaume de Machaut (pronounce: "GHEE-yoam de MA-show") (born around 1300; died April 1377), was a Medieval French poet and composer. He was the most important composer of the 14th century. He is one of the earliest composers whose life we know something about.

Machaut worked for John of Luxemburg, king of Bohemia, around 1323. The king travelled around Europe, fighting, and Machaut went with him, working as his secretary. After 1330 he became canon of several cathedrals. After John of Luxemburg died during a battle in 1346, Machaut worked for John's daughter Bonne (who later married King John II of France), then King Charles the Bad of Navarre, Charles of Normandy who became King Charles V in 1364 and the King of Cyprus. He also worked for wealthy dukes. With all that work it is surprising that he had time to compose. He seems to have spent his later years living in Rheins, working on his compositions. 

Machaut wrote many motets and the secular songs, as well as many poems including rondeaus, virelais and ballades). Machaut wrote a mass known as "Messe de Nostre Dame". It is the earliest known setting of the complete text for the mass, and it had a lot of influence on later composers.

Many of his poems belong to the type which were known as "dits". A "dit" (meaning: "spoken") was a poem that was not meant to be sung. It was in the first person (the "I" form). Many of them are about a lover trying to get the attentions of a lady he loves.

Machaut's poetry had an influence on many later poets, including Geoffrey Chaucer.

Pérotin

Pérotin (lived around 1200), was a medieval composer. He was probably French. Nothing is known about his life except that he worked in or around Paris in the late 12th century to early 13th century. People have tried to find out who he was by studying the archives of Notre Dame Cathedral, but his name has not been found there. He probably had another name, and used the name Pérotin for his compositions. 

Pérotin worked on a very important collection of polyphonic music called "Magnus Liber" (meaning: Big Book). The composer Léonin had written a lot of this music. He may have been Pérotin's teacher, but we do not know. He seems to have written music for four voices which are settings of words for the Feast of the Circumcision and St Stephen's Day. He wrote three and four voice music of a type called organum. It was a very important development in the history of Western music. He wrote music in a polyphonic style. Often he took a tune and arranged it so that one voice sang it incredibly slowly while another voice sang something much faster on top.

It is difficult to work out any dates for his works because of the way the music was written. Often it is not even clear what mode they are in.

Pérotin's music has been an influence on some 20th century composers who wrote minimalist music such as Steve Reich.

Stratford station

Stratford station is a railway station in Stratford, Newham, East London. It is on National Rail, London Underground, London Overground and Docklands Light Railway (DLR) lines. It is served by the Underground Central and Jubilee lines, and by London Overground, National Express East Anglia and c2c. It is in Travelcard Zone 3. To distinguish the station from this station is called Stratford (London) by National Rail, and is sometimes referred to as Stratford Regional to distinguish it from Stratford International station away.

These platforms are at ground level and run north-south. Platforms 2 and 13-15 are served by a footbridge (with lifts and escalators) from the main station entrance. Platform 1 joins directly onto the main station concourse.


These platforms are above the Low Level station and run at right angles, roughly east-west - the lines to the old platforms 1 & 2 pass beneath the High Level station. Access from the main station entrance is via a subway; a second subway links the Jubilee line platforms directly to platforms 3–10. A third subway, which served the old entrance to the station, is closed and available for emergency use only, but between Spring 2009 and Winter 2010 the subway should reopen. 








All times refer to off-peak services.



All services to Liverpool Street (Monday to Friday limited services).

All services from Liverpool Street (Monday to Friday limited services).

Two tube lines serve Stratford. 

Both run a frequent service throughout the day.


All lines at Stratford are electrified. Unusually, there are four different systems of electrification in use, a record for any station in London. These are:

The nearby Stratford International station will open on 13 December 2009 when Southeastern begins its domestic high-speed service between St Pancras and Kent. In mid-2010 an extension of the Docklands Light Railway over part of the North London Line will link the two stations using platforms 1 and 2, after the North London Line is rerouted to two new platforms (high-level 1 & 2) located to the north of the existing platform 12. The existing subway links which connect the ticket hall to the Central Line and Great Eastern platforms will be extended northwards to the new North London Line platforms. The platforms were originally scheduled to open in January 2009, but this has been delayed. The platforms were opened on 14 April 2009.

There are also plans to build an additional westbound Central Line platform, numbered 3A, to allow passengers to leave the train on both sides and thus reduce dwell times for trains serving central London at peak hours. This will be connected to the existing infrastructure built for the Jubilee Line Extension, at the mezzanine level. Along with this new platform there are plans to build a new ticket hall at the eastern end of the mezzanine. This will relieve congestion at the existing ticket hall.

In preparation for the Olympics and the Stratford City development, a new north-facing exit and ticket hall will be constructed. Both existing passenger subways will be extended north to connect with the ticket hall, and the abandoned subway at the eastern end of the station, which formed part of the old station complex, will be reopened and refurbished to allow interchange between platforms 3 through to new high-level 1 & 2. A new pedestrian bridge may also be built to connect Stratford shopping centre with the Stratford City development. This pedestrian link will also connect the mezzanine level ticket hall with the northern ticket hall.

The National Express East Anglia service north to Tottenham Hale may see a re-opened station at . This is not likely to take place until after the 2012 Olympics.

There are plans to extend the Jubilee line north of Stratford along the route of the Lea Valley Lines to Chingford in Waltham Forest.

The station will also become a major interchange for Crossrail services which are due to commence in 2017.

<br>

Stratford Station also has its own bus station completed in the late 1990s. The following London Buses routes 25, 69, 86, 104, 108, 158, 238, 241, 257, 262, 276, 308, 425 , 473, 474, 678, S2, N8, N86 and coach route A9 (to Stansted Airport) serve the station.

Léonin (lived in the late 12th century) is the first composer we know about who wrote organum, a kind of church music. We know nothing about his life. He was probably French. He seems to have worked at Notre Dame Cathedral because he wrote a collection of music called "Magnus Liber" (meaning: Big Book), or, at least, he wrote some of it. This book has music for two voices. It was designed for services at Notre Dame. A younger composer called Pérotin did some more work on the collection, changing some of it.

Dmitri Kabalevsky

Dmitri Kabalevsky (born Saint Petersburg, 30 December 1904; died Moscow, 18 February 1987) was a Russian Soviet composer.

Kabalevsky is particularly well known as a composer of children's music. He wrote a lot of piano music. Many of these pieces are short pieces for children who are learning the piano. He also wrote larger works such as concertos for the piano and violin. In 1918, his family moved to Moscow, where he had formal lessons in music at the Scriabin Musical Institute. He was known for attempting to get children involved in music. In 1925 he began his training at the Moscow Conservatory, studying composition with Catoire and later with Miaskovsky, also continuing piano studies with Goldenveyzer.

<doc id="181499" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181499" title="Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)">
Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)

Symphony No. 5 in C minor, Op. 67, is a symphony that was composed by Ludwig van Beethoven. It is the fifth of the nine symphonies that he composed. It was written between 1804 and 1808. This symphony is one of the most popular and well-known works of classical music.

There are four movements: an opening sonata allegro, a slower andante, and a fast scherzo which leads straight in to the "" to the finale. 

The symphony was first performed in Vienna's Theater an der Wien in 1808. His Sixth Symphony was also performed for the first time at the same concert. The Fifth Symphony soon became recognized as one of the most important musical works.

The symphony begins with a four-note "short-short-short-long" motif which is heard twice (slightly lower the second time): 

The opening of the symphony is so famous that it has often been quoted. Other composers have used it in their compositions, e.g. Sergei Rachmaninoff in his song "Fate". It has often been used in popular culture, from disco to rock and roll, and in film and television. During World War II, the BBC used the four-note motif to introduce its radio news broadcasts because "short-short-short-long" spells the letter "V" in Morse code. The "V" meant "Victory". It was played very quietly on a drum. People in Nazi occupied countries who wanted to hear the news listened in secret to the BBC news because it was more likely to be true.

The third movement of the symphony uses this rhythm sometimes as an accompaniment. 

When Beethoven wrote this symphony he was in his mid-thirties. He was becoming more and more deaf. He found this terribly hard to bear. He thought that he, of all people, should have perfect hearing. He felt very depressed, but he decided not to commit suicide, but to stay alive and write down all the music he had in his head. He wrote about this in a letter called the Heiligenstadt Testament.

The opening of the Fifth Symphony sounds very bold and heroic. The whole symphony is sounds like a struggle which starts from those four notes. People have often said that those four notes represent fate knocking at the door. By the time we get to the last movement (the finale) the music has become major instead of minor. It sounds as if Beethoven has overcome his depression.

The fourth movement of this symphony is one of the first times a trombones or a piccolo is used in a symphony.

Spectrum of a ring

The spectrum of a ring is a thing studied in the branch of mathematics called Algebraic Geometry. This construction allows us to think of abstract mathematical objects as "functions" acting over some geometric space. In this case, the most natural geometric space is called the spectrum of the ring.

Commutative ring

A commutative ring is a set of elements in which you can add and multiply and have multiplication distribute over addition. An example of a commutative ring is the set of integers. If we add two integers, we get an integer and if we multiply two integers we get another integer. Moreover, multiplication distributes in the sense that if "a" and "b" and "c" are integers, then "c*(a+b)=ca+cb".

Homotopy

Homotopies are things studied in a branch of mathematics known as Algebraic Topology. A homotopy is a deformation (change of form) of one thing into another without cutting it. For example, if we imagine an object made out of rubber, then all the shapes we can stretch or twist it into are "homotopy equivalent". One famous example is the homotopy equivalence of a coffee cup and a donut. To a topologist, these two shapes are the same.

Turandot

Turandot is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini, set to a libretto in Italian by Giuseppe Adami and Renato Simoni. When Puccini died he had not finished the opera. It was later finished by Franco Alfano. It was first performed at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 25 April 1926, conducted by Arturo Toscanini. This performance included only Puccini's music and not Alfano's additions. The first performance of the opera as completed by Alfano was conducted by Ettore Panizza.

The most famous song from the opera is the aria "Nessun dorma". This aria was sung by the three tenors Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and José Carreras, and used as the theme tune for the 1990 Soccer World Cup. This made Nessun dorma probably the best known of all opera arias.

Marsupial Lion

The Marsupial Lion, Thylacoleo carnifex, is an extinct species of carnivorous marsupial that lived in Australia from the early to the late Pleistocene, from 1,600,000 to 40,000 years ago. The scientific name comes from the words "thylakos" - pouch, "leo" - lion, and "carnifex" - murderer, tormentor, or butcher. It is the largest meat eating mammal to have lived in Australia.

Fossil remains on the dry Nullarbor Plain show that humans and climate change caused the extinction of the Australian megafauna around 45,000 years ago.

The Marsupial Lion is closely related to the wombat and the koala, and not the cat family. It looked like a cat, with strong claws and very powerful jaws. Scientists have worked out that the Marsupial Lion had the most powerful bite of any animal, alive or extinct.
It was able to hunt animals like the giant kangaroo and the giant wombat, but its big jaw would have made it hard to hunt and kill small animals. The Marsupial Lion could weigh up to . It was about long and stood about tall.

Fossil bones of the Marsupial Lion have been found in caves on the Nullabor Plain. Scientists say that these bones are between 400,000 to 800,000 years old. In 2006, cave paintings were found in northwest Australia, showing the Marsupial Lion. The pictures show that the lions had a striped back, tufted tail, and pointy ears. The long drought in south east Victoria has dried out many lakes. In 2009, a farmer near Ballarat discovered fossil footprints and a jaw bone of a marsupial lion preserved in limestone in a dry lake bed.

Hibari Misora

Hibari Misora was born in Isogo-ku, Yokohama, Japan. Her father was , a fishmonger, and her mother , a housewife. Misora showed musical talent from an early age after singing for her father at a World War II send-off party in 1943. When he saw this, he used much of his family's savings to allow his daughter to start a musical career. In 1945 she gave her first performance in a concert hall in Yokohama, at the age of eight. She used the name , which her mother had proposed. A year later she appeared on a NHK broadcast, and impressed the Japanese composer Masao Koga with her singing skill. He thought she was a prodigy with the courage, understanding, and emotional maturity of an adult. In the next two years, she became an accomplished singer and was touring notable concert halls to sold-out crowds. Her recording career began in 1949 at the age of twelve, when she changed her stage-name to and starred in the film . The film brought her nationwide recognition. She recorded her first single for Columbia Records later that year. It became a commercial hit, selling more than 450,000 copies. After that, she recorded "Kanashiki kuchibue", which was featured on a radio program and was a national hit. As an actress, she starred in about 160 movies from 1949 to 1971, and won many awards. Her performance in "Tokyo Kiddo" (1950), in which she played a street orphan, made her symbolic of both the hardship and the national optimism of post-World War II Japan. Her third single was from the film and was another hit, "Watashi wa machi no ko".

As a singer, she became known for her performance of enka, a sentimental form of Japanese popular music which emerged during the early part of the 20th century, and was renowned for her live performances, and singing which encapsulated the emotional pain of those who had suffered. Although she did not understand English, she made excellent recordings US jazz standards.

Throughout her career she recorded over 1,401 songs, with her best selling song "Yawara" selling 1.8 million times.

In 1973 Tetsuya Katō, Misora's brother, was prosecuted for gang-related activity. Although NHK did not acknowledge any connection, Misora was excluded from "Kouhaku uta gassen" for the first time in eighteen years. Offended, she refused to appear on NHK for years afterwards.

Health problems also plagued her in her later years. In April of 1987, on the way to a performance in Fukuoka, Misora suddenly collapsed. Rushed to hospital, she was diagnosed with avascular necrosis brought on by chronic hepatitis. She was confined to a hospital in Fukuoka, and eventually showed signs of recovery in August. She commenced recording a new song in October, and in April of 1988 performed at a concert at the Tokyo Dome. Despite overwhelming pain in her legs, she performed a total of 39 songs.

Her triumph was to be short lived. She had drunk a lot of alcohol for decades. This had weakened her liver, and her condition grew worse. On 24 June 1989, after being confined to a hospital in Tokyo, she died from pneumonia at the age of 52. Her death was widely mourned throughout Japan.

Beginning in 1990, television and radio stations play her song on her birthdate each year to show respect. In a national poll by NHK in 1997, the song was voted the greatest Japanese song of all time by more than 10 million people.

In 1994, the "Hibari Misora Museum" opened in Arashiyama, Kyoto. It traced the history of Misora's life and career in multi-media exhibits, and displayed various memorabilia. It attracted more than 5 million visitors, until it officially closed on November 30, 2006, as to allow a scheduled reconstruction of the building. The main exhibits were moved into the Shōwa period section of the Edo-Tokyo Museum, until reconstruction was complete. The new "Hibari Misora Theater" opened on April 26, 2008, and includes a CD for sale of a previously unreleased song. 

People are unsure where Hibari Misora's parents were originally from. 
Some people think that she was of Korean origins, and that both her parents and herself had Korean passports. Others disagree. After studying her ancestry, they think that her parents were not Korean, but rather Japanese.

Snorks

Snorks is an animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, and created by Belgian comics Freddy Monnickendam.

The Snorks are a race of small, colorful, fictional beings that live happily in the underwater world of Snorkland. They have snorkels on their heads, which are used to propel them swiftly through the water. As evidenced by the cartoon series, when a Snork becomes excited their tube makes a ""snork"" sound. Like the Flintstones or the Smurfs, they have much of the same technology as contemporary humans, adapted to their own aquatic environment. The Snorks use clams as currency, a reference to the slang word ""clam"", meaning ""dollar."" 

According to the Snork back-story, a few ventured to the surface (which the Snorks believe is "outer space") in 1643, and watched a Royal Navy ship being attacked by pirates. The captain wound up in the water, and that was the first contact between the species when the Snorks saved his life, to which the captain then expressed his gratitude by writing a book about the Snorks, although very few humans believe in the existence of the Snorks. Since then, Snorks have adopted several human habits, such as wearing clothes.

<doc id="181755" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181755" title="The Mask: The Animated Series">
The Mask: The Animated Series

The Mask: The Animated Series is a television animated series based on the comic book superhero, The Mask, but with most of its inspiration from the 1994 film adaptation. The show ran for three seasons, from 1995 to 1997, and spawned its own short-run comic book series, "Adventures of The Mask". 

Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz's character in the movie) was absent, but reporter Peggy Brandt had become the main female character. Unlike in the movie, Ipkiss was able to use the mask in daytime as well as at night.

Much as with the "Beetlejuice" cartoon before it, The Mask TAS took many elements from the source movie but dropped characters and changed certain other characters. Peggy's inclusion also officially discounts the cut scene in the film where she is killed. Tina is never even alluded to. However, the events of the movie are alluded to, as Charlie knew that Stanley was the Mask (though did not know Stanley kept it), and Stanley was still upset over Peggy selling him out to the mob (given that Stanley and Peggy were never treated as a potential couple, there may have remained some bad feelings over that though The Mask himself sometimes tries to woo her). A gypsy at one point claims that the Mask is the most powerful artifact in the world when she remarks "The most powerful artifact in the world and this idiot keeps it with his laundry".

The cartoon, despite having a "realistic" setting in the fictional town of Edge City, would often rely more on Tex Avery-style humor and on occasion, broke any meaningful laws of reality - one episode featured the Goofalotatots, parodies of the Animaniacs, treating them as if they were naturally alive. Another featured the Mask becoming a personal assistant to the President of the US, with the job merely handed to him (the president was a caricature of no real president - it should also be noted that former Mask comic writer John Arcudi wrote both example episodes, a stark departure from his usual writing). Police officers were portrayed as idiots who couldn't see even obvious clues.

Also continued from the movie was the consistent visiting by The Mask of the Coco Bongo - a fictional, glamorous night club frequented by the Edge City well-to-do, which was most likely based on the Copacabana in New York City. In the episode "A Comedy of Eras", in which Dr. Chronos manipulates time so that the future Edge City becomes a corrupted, Nineteen Eighty-Four-like dictatorial society ruled by the villainess, features a Coco Bongo which has been destroyed - a development that horrifies and enrages The Mask and provides him with the motivation to ultimately defeat Dr. Chronos.






The main villain, Dr. Pretorius (voiced by Tim Curry), was a madman who had his own head removed from his body and placed on tiny, spider-like robotic legs, which could attach to a larger android body. His plans always revolved around either obtaining or controlling the Mask (Pretorius is one of the few characters in the series aware of The Mask's true identity), or as part of some increasingly insane "science experiments" which, if carried out, would result in the death of thousands or even the end of mankind. He mostly pronounces Ipkiss' last name as "Ipp-kiss". Pretorius was also likely a parody of drug dealer/mob boss Eugene Rapaz from the original comics (both share the same face. Rapaz wore small, rounded-lens dark glasses and Pretorius had round optic implants that looked similar, as well).

In the episode, "Sister Mask", Dr. Pretorius did eventually gain the mask, and as with Tyrell, retained his own personality while wearing it (While the mask is said to release one's own inhibitions, those who have no inhibitions seem to retain full conscious control while wearing the Mask, such as the Joker in the DC crossover).

Coming from the comics was Walter, Pretorius's goon, still silent and indestructible but not as murderous and cruel. Walter chased the Mask for several episodes, but when he obtained the wooden mask and it failed to work for him, he simply dropped it. Walter remained a recurring character throughout the series. He is strong enough to actually break the Mask in two (an impressive feat as only seconds before the Mask withstood being hit by cars and run over by a steamroller without a scratch).

Ben Stein reprised his role as Dr. Neuman, from the movie. In one episode, the mask falls into Neuman's hands, and he becomes a super-villain. Dr. Neuman rampaged throughout the city, claming everyone suffered from a disease he called"Ipkissiamascosus". He was determined to kill Stanley and even goes as far as to spring Pretorius from prison to aid him (a running gag, however, was that Dr. Neuman refused to believe the mask worked, even when he had it on).

A third villain who made it to the TV series for a few times was the mad Dr. Amelia Chronos, who, with her ambitions of gaining power and dominance through the manipulation of time, often caused quite a lot of chaos through inventions like a machine that kept looping time every half hour for everyone but herself (so that even the Mask could never foil her plans, since by the time he got to her, everything would be reset to a half hour prior), a gun that reversed/fast forwarded time for whoever it was aimed at (so that the person would keep getting younger and younger until he/she became nothing, or became older and older until he/she was dead), a large time portal through which she could summon anything to defeat the Mask (such as prehistoric creatures, robots from the future, etc) though none of them worked and an actual time machine through which she could travel into the past or future to manipulate events so that she would ultimately be victorious in her quest for world dominance. 

For villains as for the Mask's transformation, there was often DC Comics parodies, as Supermask and Super Salad Man (a parody of Superman). Some Marvel references were made too, like The Mask becoming Biclops (a parody of Cyclops), Spiderhyny (alias Spiderman), Green Surfer (alias Silver Surfer) and Toolverine (a parody of Wolverine), and a villain that turned into a dinosaur like Sauron. Notable were Skillit (parody of Mr. Mxyzptlk and Peter Pan, albeit much more malevolent in nature) and Putty Thing (parody of the version of Clayface, portrayed as a dumb teenager rather than an angry, jaded actor).

The Mask also had a few more villainous enemies in his rogues gallery such as:
















Stanley Ipkiss is the owner and wearer of The Mask, but there have been others who have worn the Mask (either accidentally or intenionally). Some episodes focus on this aspect; someone gets his/hers hands (or face) on the Mask and Stanley usually tries get it back with difficulty. The other wearers are:











1 & 2. The Mask Is Always Greener on the Other Side (Parts 1 & 2): After causing him nothing but trouble, Stanley Ipkiss gets rid of his mask by burying it in quick-drying cement, but must retrieve it to save Peggy and Milo after Pretorius tricks Stanley's friend and coworker, Charlie, into building a "house of tomorrow" and kidnaps them.<br>

The Terrible Twos: When Kellaway tries to prove that Stanley is the Mask by handcuffing the two together, Stanley must go to elaborate lengths to get away from the detective when two mutants Putty Thing and Fish Guy (formerly two teenage slackers named Dak and Eddie who irradiated themselves so they can become superheroes) go on the rampage.<br>
4. Baby's Wild Ride: A baby-sitting job turns difficult when the infant acquires the Mask and joins a biker gang with their chief Lonnie The Shark (who is posing as children's show host Barnaby the Dinosaur).<br>

8. Double Reverse: A reverse therapy treatment helps Stanley deprive the Mask of its power by acting like the Mask in his normal state, but when a criminal called Kablamus, capable of exploding and surviving, arrives in the city, Stanley must get the powerless Mask to work once again.<br>
9. Shrink Rap: Stanley rids himself of the mask by giving it to his therapist, Dr. Neuman, who puts it on and starts going on a rampage and joins up with Pretorius, who's planning to nuke the city so he can use the flash of the explosion to photograph an alien race's planet.<br>
10. Martian Mask: FBI agents mistakenly believe The Mask is actually an alien bent on world domination and do everything to capture him, whilst Putty Thing and Fish Guy go on a road trip.<br>
11. Mayor Mask: Frustrated by Edge City's mismanagement, Stanley puts on the Mask hoping he will teach Mayor Tilton a lesson. Instead, The Mask announces his candidacy against Mayor Tilton as the new mayor of Edge City. Though Stanley naturally objects, he is then forced to make sure his alter ego wins the election when he discovers the real Mayor Tilton was captured and that Dr. Pretorius is masquerading as him so he can turn all of Edge City into subjects for toxic waste experiments.<br>
12. How Much Is That Dog in the Tin Can?: Milo puts on The Mask to battle an insane dogcatcher capturing dogs for a (somewhat) sinister purpose. Meanwhile, Walter starts stalking Stanley.<br>
13. All Hallow's Eve: On Halloween night, Skillit escapes from reform school, determined to get revenge on the Mask for making him do homework.<br>
14. Santa Mask: All the villains in Edge City begin disguising themselves as Santa Claus and committing crimes. The Mask must save Christmas by proving Santa's innocence.<br>
15. Split Personality: The Mask breaks in half, resulting in both Stanley and the Mask existing at the same time; unfortunately, with Walter after the Mask and an old high school acquaintance of Stanley's after revenge on Stanley for getting him expelled, the two personalities must work together to piece the mask together.

16. A Comedy of Eras: The Mask battles a mad female scientist named Chronos who sends The Mask to the future and to the era of the Salem Witch Trials.<br>
17. Goin' for the Green: After being humiliated by the Mask during an unveiling of his latest statue, Mayor Tilton recruits Colonel Beauregard Klaxon, a Southern businessman to create The Edge City Games as a distraction from The Mask's antics, but Colonel Klaxon uses this opportunity to store nuclear waste underneath the stadium where the Edge Games are played.<br>
18. Flight as a Feather: Hours before a Swedish karaoke contest at the Coco Bongo, The Mask loses his lucky fedora feather and races through Edge City to get it--all the while trying to avoid Kellaway and Doyle and a string of eccentric characters, including Mayor Tilton's vengeful ex-girlfriend, a performance artist, an eagle, and Pretorious's goon, Walter.<br>
19. The Good, the Bad and the Fish Guy: Putty Thing and Fish Guy return, but with Fish Guy having acquired the Mask, Stanley must convince Putty Thing to work with him before the whole city is destroyed.<br>

Man-in-the-middle attack

A Man-in-the-middle attack is a form of attack on cryptography or communication systems where two parties who want to talk to each other pass their messages through a third. In the attack, the third party can read the messages, change their contents, withhold or insert new messages.

In the attack, the messages received by either end seem to be legitimate and from the correct source.

In cryptography, this is often a problem with key distribution, and gave rise to public key cryptography.

<doc id="181827" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181827" title="Noble savage">
Noble savage

The term "noble savage" is an idea people had: Without civilization, humans are essentially good; it is civilisation that makes them act in bad ways. The idea started in the 17th century and developed in the 18th century. One of the first to express it was Shaftesbury. He told the would-be author “to search for that simplicity of manners, and innocence of behaviour, which has been often known among mere savages; ere they were corrupted by our commerce” ("Advice to an Author", Part III.iii). His counter to the doctrine of original sin, born amid the optimistic atmosphere of Renaissance humanism, was taken up by another author who lived at the same time, the essayist Richard Steele, who attributed the corruption of contemporary manners to false education.

In the eighteenth-century cult of "Primitivism" the noble savage, uncorrupted by the influences of civilization, was considered more worthy, more authentically noble than the contemporary product of civilized training. Although the phrase "noble savage" first appeared in Dryden's "The Conquest of Granada" (1672), the idealized picture of "nature's gentleman" was an aspect of eighteenth-century sentimentalism, among other forces at work. 

During the seventeenth century, as an aspect of Romantic "Primitivism", the figure of the "Good Savage" was held up as a reproach to European civilization, then in the throes of savage wars of religion. People were especially horrified by the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew (1572), in which some 20,000 men, women, and children were massacred, chiefly in Paris, but also throughout France, in a three-day period. This led Montaigne to write his famous essay "Of Cannibals" (1587), in which he stated that although cannibals ceremoniously eat each other, Europeans behave even more barbarously and burn each other alive for disagreeing about religion. The treatment of indigenous peoples by the Spanish Conquistadors also produced a great deal of bad conscience and recriminations.. Bartolomé de las Casas, who witnessed it, may have been the first to idealize the simple life of the indigenous Americans. He and other observers praised the simple manners of the indigenous Americans and reported that they were incapable of lying. European guilt over colonialism, with its use of recently invented guns on people who did not have them inspired fictional treatments such as Aphra Behn's novel "Oroonoko, or the Royal Slave", about a slave revolt in Surinam in the West Indies. Behn's story was not primarily a protest against slavery but was written for money; and it met readers' expectations by following the conventions of the European romance novella. The leader of the revolt, Oroonoko, is truly noble in that he is a hereditary African prince, and he laments his lost African homeland in the traditional terms of a Golden Age. He is not a savage but dresses and behaves like a European aristocrat. Behn's story was adapted for the stage by Irish playwright Thomas Southerne, who stressed its sentimental aspects, and as time went on it came to be seen as addressing the issues of slavery and colonialism, remaining very popular throughout the Eighteenth Century.

In English, the phrase "Noble Savage" first appeared in Dryden's play, "The Conquest of Granada" (1672): "I am as free as nature first made man, / Ere the base laws of servitude began, / When wild in woods the noble savage ran." However, the term "Noble Savage" only began to be widely used in the last half of the nineteenth century and then as a term of disparagement. In French the term had been the "Good Savage" (or good "Wild man"), and, in French (and even in eighteenth-century English), the word "savage" did not necessarily have the connotations of cruelty we now associate with it, but meant "wild" as in a wild flower. 

The idealized picture of "Nature's Gentleman" was an aspect of eighteenth-century sentimentalism, along with other stock figures such as, the Virtuous Milkmaid, the Servant-More-Clever-than-the-Master (such as Sancho Panza and Figaro, among countless others), and the general theme of virtue in the lowly born. Nature's Gentleman, whether European-born or exotic, takes his place among these tropes, along with the Wise Egyptian, Persian, and Chinaman. He had always existed, from the time of the epic of Gilgamesh, where he appears as Enkiddu, the wild-but-good man who lives with animals; and the untutored-but-noble medieval knight, Parsifal. Even the Biblical David the shepherd boy, falls into this category. Indeed, that virtue and lowly birth can coexist is a time-honored tenet of Abrahamic religion, most conspicuously so in the case of the Founder of the Christian religion. Likewise, the idea that withdrawal from society—and specifically from cities—is associated with virtue, is originally a religious one.

"Hayy ibn Yaqdhan" an Islamic philosophical tale (or thought experiment) by Ibn Tufail from twelfth-century Andalusia, straddles the divide between the religious and the secular. The tale is of interest because it was known to the New England Puritan divine, Cotton Mather. Translated in to English (from Latin) in 1686 and 1708, it tells the story of Hayy, a wild child, raised by a gazelle, without human contact, on a deserted island in the Indian Ocean. Purely through the use of his reason, Hayy goes through all the gradations of knowledge before emerging into human society, where he revealed to be a believer of Natural religion, which Cotton Mather, as a Christian Divine, identified with Primitive Christianity. The figure of Hayy is both a Natural man and a Wise Persian, but not a Noble Savage.

The "locus classicus" of the eighteenth century portrayal of the American Indian is that of Alexander Pope, unquestionably the most famous and widely-translated poet of his day. In his philosophical poem, "Essay on Man" (1734), Pope wrote: 
Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutor'd mind /
Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind; /
His soul proud Science never taught to stray / 
Far as the solar walk or milky way; / 
Yet simple Nature to his hope has giv'n, / 
Behind the cloud-topp'd hill, a humbler heav'n; /
Some safer world in depth of woods embrac'd, /
Some happier island in the wat'ry waste, / 
Where slaves once more their native land behold, / 
No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold! / 
To be, contents his natural desire; / 
He asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire: / 
But thinks, admitted to that equal sky, / 
His faithful dog shall bear him company.

Pope's poem expresses the typical Age of Reason belief that men are everywhere and in all times the same, which was also Christian doctrine (Pope was a Catholic). He portrays his Indian as a victim ("the poor Indian"), who, although less learned and with less aspirations than his European counterpart, is as good or better and hence equally worthy of salvation. He is a "bon sauvage", but not a noble one.


In the first century CE, all of these qualities had been attributed by Tacitus to the German barbarians in his "Germania", in which he contrasted them repeatedly with the softened, Romanized, corrupted Gauls, by inference criticizing his own Roman culture for getting away from its roots—which was the perennial function of such comparisons. The Germans did not inhabit a "Golden Age" of ease, but were tough and inured to hardship, qualities which Tacitus saw as preferable to the "softness" of civilized life. In antiquity this form of "hard Primitivism", whether viewed as desirable or seen as something to escape, co-existed in rhetorical opposition to the "soft Primitivism" of visions of a lost Golden Age of ease and plenty.

The legendary toughness and martial valor of the Spartans were also admired throughout the ages by hard Primitivists; and in the Eighteenth Century a Scottish writer described Highland countrymen this way:

They greatly excel the Lowlanders in all the exercises that require agility; they are incredibly abstemious, and patient of hunger and fatigue; so steeled against the weather, that in traveling, even when the ground is covered with snow, they never look for a house, or any other shelter but their plaid, in which they wrap themselves up, and go to sleep under the cope of heaven. Such people, in quality of soldiers, must be invincible . . .

Victoria Station

Victoria station is a major National Rail, London Underground and coach station in the City of Westminster. It is the second busiest railway terminus in London after Waterloo. It is in Travelcard Zone 1. It is named after Queen Victoria.

The National Rail station is officially named 'London Victoria', a name that is sometimes used outside London, but never by Londoners. The station has two separate parts:


This split is generally held to, as the track layout does not allow much swapping, with only a small number of connecting flyovers between the main lines in the Battersea area, and a single track connection just outside the station. As the Brighton side is the busier of the two, disruption on that line sometimes results in some of its suburban services using the eastern side. This is often true of the Gatwick Express, which travels along the Brighton Main Line, as it will often divert over Chatham side tracks during engineering works in order to maintain service levels.

Victoria also serves as the London terminus for the Venice Simplon Orient Express, from Platform 2, the longest platform.

There are ticket barriers to platforms 1-12 and 15-19. Platforms 13 and 14 don't have ticket barriers and this is where the Gatwick Express service departs.

The London Underground station lies to the north of the mainline station concourse.It is currently the busiest station on the system with around 76 million using the station (not including interchanging passengers) as of 2007, 60.2 million (including interchanges) using the Victoria Line platforms. There are two ticket halls. The newer hall, closer to the mainline station, serves the Victoria Line; the other, farther north, serves the District and Circle Lines. The ticket halls are connected by a pedestrian passage beneath the Bus station.

Proposed

Victoria coach station is half a mile south-west of the railway stations. It is the largest and most significant coach station in London. It serves long distance coach services and is also the departure point for many countryside coach tours originating from London. It serves all parts of the UK, and mainland Europe.

The Victoria bus station is directly outside Victoria Station. It services only London Buses, with 19 routes and 200 buses per hour at busy times. Bus 'spider' maps are available from TfL; they are designed like tube maps.

The Green Line Coach Station is another coach station near Victoria Station. The station offers long distance coach services by Green Line Coaches and Greyhound UK.

Heating oil

Heating oil is oil that is burned as fuel in furnaces inside of buildings. The oil is usually delivered by tanker truck to individual homes and business places, and the oil is stored in oil tanks in the basement or outside, next to the building. If oil leaks into the ground, it's an environmental problem because even a small leak can cause major groundwater pollution, making the water from wells and springs unusable because chemicals from the oil are harmful to both humans and animals. Heating oil is usually dyed to make sure it is not confused with vehicle fuel.

Heating oil, also known as "No. 2 fuel oil", accounts for about 25% of the output of a barrel of crude oil, the second-biggest "cut" after gasoline. 

Among processed fuels, the need for heating oil has been going down, while the usage of liquefied petroleum gas has increased.

Investors and suppliers trade contracts that promise the delivery of large amounts of heating oil before a certain date in the future, at a specific price. These futures contracts trade in units of 42,000 gallons, which is the same as 1,000 barrels. Prices are based on delivery in New York City harbor, the main cash market trading center.

Finsbury Park station

Finsbury Park Station is a busy transport interchange in North London. The interchange consists of an interconnected National Rail station, London Underground station and two bus stations. The main entrances are by the eastern bus station on Station Place. The National Rail ticket office here lies in between one entrance marked by the Underground roundel symbol, while the other is marked by the National Rail symbol, and provides direct access to the main line platforms. There is another exit by the western bus station along Wells Terrace, incoroporating the Underground ticket office, plus a narrow side entrance to the south on the A503 Seven Sisters Road. The complex is located in Travelcard Zone 2.

The above-ground National Rail station, which has a separate ticket office to the Underground station, is managed and served by First Capital Connect. Trains from Moorgate and King's Cross form inner suburban services to Welwyn Garden City and Hertford North and outer suburban services start from Kings Cross towards Peterborough and Cambridge. Inner suburban service do not serve the Moorgate branch during late evenings and at weekends, being diverted to London Kings Cross instead. There are six platforms, but only five tracks, given that platforms 4 and 5 share a track. Platform 1 is used by London Moorgate services heading into London, platform 6 by Moorgate services heading northbound. Platforms 2 (southbound) and 3 (northbound) by Kings Cross services, usually fast but sometimes stopping. Platforms 4/5 by stopping northbound trains from Kings Cross.

The station is served by the Piccadilly and Victoria lines. Although thought of as a 'deep-level' tube station, Finsbury Park has neither lifts nor escalators as its lines are less than 20' (6.1 m) below street level, though there used to be lifts from the high-level platforms to the tube level. These were the last hydraulically operated lifts on LT. The access to the Piccadilly and Victoria line platforms is by staircase only, reached via two narrow passages that physically prevent the installation of automatic ticket barriers - remarkable, considering its Zone 2 location. Manual ticket inspections do, however, regularly take place. Oystercard readers are available for "pay as you go" customers.

Anti-psychiatry

There are a number of social and political movements that question certain practices of psychiatry. One movement originated during the French Revolution of 1789 and was influenced by romantic ideals. Another movement started in Germany around 1900. The third big movement was stated in the United States and Europe in the 1960s. This movement questioned the classification of Schizophrenia as a mental illness, to be treated by psychiatry and also wanted to highlight certain problems of psychiatric wards. 

One of the people who influenced the 1960s movement a great deal was Michel Foucault. His book "Folie et déraison: Histoire de la folie à l'âge classique" (Madness and Insanity: History of Madness in the Classical Age) is about the question at what point madness starts. 
South African psychiatrist David Cooper was the first to use the word “anti-psychiatry”. He first used it in 1967.

Hans Knappertsbusch

Hans Knappertsbusch (born Elberfeld (Wuppertal), 12 March 1888; died Munich, 25 October 1965) was a German conductor. He conducted some of Europes best orchestras. He was especially known for conducting the music of Richard Wagner, Anton Bruckner and Richard Strauss.

Knappertsbusch was born in Elberfeld, today's Wuppertal. His parents did not want him to be a musician and sent him to study philosophy at Bonn University. However, he soon started to go to the Cologne Conservatory to study conducting with Fritz Steinbach. For a few summers, he was assistant to Siegfried Wagner and Hans Richter at Bayreuth. When Bruno Walter left Munich to go to New York, Knappertsbusch succeeded him as conductor of the Bavarian State Orchestra. He stayed in Munich until 1936 when the Nazis made it impossible for him to continue. He then went to Vienna. There he conducted the Vienna State Opera and the Vienna Philharmonic. 

When World War II ended, Knappertsbusch went back to Munich where he settled again. He often visited Vienna to conduct there. He appeared regularly at the Bayreuth Festival.

Knappertsbusch was a large man who was very popular with his audiences. He did not often travel abroad, and was never very interested in music that was being composed at the time. He did not like long rehearsals. He often thought that his orchestras were musical enough to play well without rehearsal. His recordings of "Parsifal" are very good indeed.

Knappertsbusch died in Munich in 1965.

Ernest Ansermet

Ernest Ansermet (born Vevey, Switzerland, 11 November 1883; died 20 February 1969) was a Swiss conductor.

Ansermet was born in Vevey, Switzerland. He started his career as a professor of mathematics at the University of Lausanne. He soon became more interested in conducting. He spent a year in Berlin to learn something from Arthur Nikisch and Felix Weingartner. In 1912 he began conducting at the Casino in Montreux. From 1915 to 1923 was the conductor for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. He travelled with them to France where he met Debussy and Ravel. He talked to them about how they wanted their works to be played. During World War I, he met Stravinsky, who was exiled in Switzerland. This made him very interested in Russian music. 

In 1918, Ansermet started an orchestra of his own, the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande (OSR). He remained conductor of this orchestra until he retired in 1966. He made this into an internationally famous orchestra. They travelled to many countries in Europe and America. They gave first performances of many modern works. After World War II they made many recordings for Decca Records. 

Ansermet was largely self-taught. His conducting was very different from that of many of the other famous conductors of the time such as Pierre Monteux, Wilhelm Furtwängler and Otto Klemperer. He did not like the way that Stravinsky kept making changes to his works. He conducted works by Arthur Honegger and Frank Martin, but did not like serial music such as that of Arnold Schoenberg.

He died in Geneva on 20 February 1969.

Fanfare

A fanfare is a short, showy, piece of music usually played for a special event. It is often played to announce the arrival of an important person, such as a king or queen. Fanfares are usually played by trumpets and other brass instruments, often with drums. The word "fanfare" can also used to mean an event with a lot of publicity, even if there is no actual music.

Fanfares began in the Middle Ages. Modern movies often show trumpets playing fanfares in ancient Rome but there is little evidence that this ever happened. In 18th century France, the fanfare was a piece of music with energy and repeated notes. Modern fanfares come from the 19th century in Britain where they were written for important state events such as the crowning of a king or queen. Hubert Parry wrote a fanfare, "I Was Glad", for the coronation of Edward VII.


Fanfares are used today as music at the start of television and radio news programs. Often they are used as victory marches in video games, particularly Role Playing Games. Fanfares are also seen at military parades and events. The British Army bands all have a special teams of between four and eight trumpet players to play fanfares. The new University for the Creative Arts in England has asked composer Edward Gregson to write a fanfare to play at its graduation ceremonies.

A special trumpet, usually called a herald trumpet, is often used to play fanfares. The fanfare trumpet has a long straight tube, which often can have a banner hanging from it. There are three sizes of fanfare trumpet, a Bb trumpet, tenor trumpet and a bass trumpet.

Intensive care unit

An intensive care unit (ICU), critical care unit (CCU), intensive therapy unit (ITU), or intensive treatment unit (ITU) is a special part of a hospital. Usually, people that are very sick are sent there. They need to be looked at by a nurse or doctor very closely in case they get more sick while at the hospital.

Some ICUs may work with only one type of injuries.

In 1854, Florence Nightingale went to the Crimean War. There it was important to separate seriously wounded soldiers from less-seriously wounded. Nightingale reduced death rates from 40% to 2% by creating the concept of intensive care.

Because of a polio epidemic, Bjørn Ibsen established the first intensive care unit in Copenhagen in 1953. Patients with polio require more ventilation than normal; this is why Ibsen set up a special unit for them. The first person to use this idea in the United States was Dr. William Mosenthal, a surgeon at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.

Hearing dog

A hearing dog is a special type of assistance dog that has been trained to help deaf people and people who have hearing problems. The dogs are trained to tell their owner when they hear important sounds. 

Hearing dogs need to be calm and friendly around people. They need to be trained to hear and understand certain sounds. They also have to be trained to work with their owner and to tell their owner when certain sounds occur.

The sounds can come from doorbells, smoke alarms, telephones, or alarm clocks. The hearing dogs may work outside their owner's home and be trained to hear sounds like sirens, forklifts and a person calling the owner's name. They may also be taught to respond to and/or lead away from a sound: For example, in the case of a fire alarm, the dog will usually drop to the floor, instead of leading the owner towards the alarm, which would be dangerous. 

The training period for hearing dogs may take up to year. Most hearing dogs are professionally trained, but people may choose to train a hearing dog themselves.

In most countries, hearing dogs are allowed, by law, to go to any place that the public would normally be allowed to go.

Hearing dogs may wear a brightly coloured collar and leash. They can also wear a cape or jacket to make it easier to identify them.

In the United Kingdom, hearing dogs wear distinctive jackets, which are burgundy (the colour of red wine) and have the logo of the charity which trains and pays for the dogs.

In Australia, hearing dogs are trained through the Lions Club International of Australia . They wear a bright orange leash, collar and harness to identify them, and carry with them an official ID.

Kremlin

Kremlin () is the Russian word for "fortress", "citadel" or "castle". It is used to refer to fortified central complexes which can often be found in historic Russian cities. In Moscow it refers to the central square. The Necropolis for communists is located in one of the walls of the Moscow kremlin. The mausoleum for Vladimir Lenin can be found outside. 
Because of the Katyn massacre, Joseph Stalin's body was removed from Lenin mausoleum on November 1 1961. This was very ironic, because it was during a holiday (All Saints Day) that he had banned when he came to power. Stalin's death also came exactly 13 years later to the minute of signing Katyn execution orders on March 5 1940 at 9:50pm. 
Nikita Khrushchev ordered his body be very deeply reburied behind the Kremlin Wall in a simple grave. Removal was part of the successful destalinization process started by Khrushchev in march 1953. By 1956 all stalin towns and cities were renamed worldwide.

Eavesdropping

Eavesdropping means to listen to things you aren't supposed to hear. It is a deliberate act, rather than simply overhearing someone else talking. Police and security forces are eavesdropping when they put a "tap" on to a person's telephone line to listen to the person's calls. Intelligence and security agencies are eavesdropping when they put an electronic listening device, a bug, into a room.

Governments and the military have also built large facilities designed to listen in to communications between other governments and military groups. For example the US has a large base at Pine Gap near Alice Springs, Australia, which listens to communication signals from all over the world.

Hello all! I would like to present as a candidate for adminship. Since creating his account on February 19, 2009 (although only semi-active for awhile), Mentifisto has reverted tons of vandalism (see contribs), created many pages (see his userpage), has several correct VIP reports (see 1, 2, 3, and 4), and 20+ QD tags. He has proven to be trustworthy, is an administrator on , and will only be a benefit to the Simple English Wikipedia if granted the tools. Thank you. () 04:42, 10 May 2009 (UTC)

Co-nomination by : has been an active contributer to Simple English Wikipedia for just about three months now, and he has done quite a bit to help out the project. This includes many reverting of around the wiki, making "accurate" requests, adding several reports to , creating and improving articles in the mainspace, and much more. These qualities are just right in admin candidates such as Mentifisto, and I feel he will be able to do much more for our project as an administrator, whether it involves blocking, protecting, or deleting. He is also an active administrator on the English Wikipedia (verify), so he does have some experience already which is always plus. I believe Mentifisto will be a fine administrator for Simple English Wikipedia, and hopefully the community feels the same way. Thank you. — () 09:58, 10 May 2009 (UTC)

"Candidate's acceptance:" I accept and thank both AE and RyanCross for the nom. I'd just like to help whenever I can without having to bother others with requests, and so hope that you'll trust me with this. -- 04:55, 10 May 2009 (UTC)

<doc id="182331" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=182331" title="Distribution (mathematics)">
Distribution (mathematics)

In mathematics, a distribution is a generalisation of a function. Distributions were introduced in the middle of the 20th century by Laurent Schwartz, who received a Fields Medal for his work on them. The Fields medal is comparable to a Nobel Prize in mathematics, which does not exist. 

Distributions were introduced to model certain concepts from Physics. Physics has the concept of a "mass of points in space". The Dirac delta function can model an electromagnetic charge of a point in space. The Dirac delta function is zero everywhere, except at one point, where it is infinitely large. This needs to be the case, because the density function needs to be 1. There is no function that can meet this criterion, except if integraton is taken as a "function" in the mathematical sense.

Today, distributions are used in different fields of mathematics and physics, for example to model Partial differential equations or Fourier analyses, which are important for Quantum electrodynamics or signal processing.

Macro photography

Macro photography is a kind of photography. Macro photography is about photographing objects that are very close to the lens, the film or the sensor. Using the classic definition, in macro photography the image shown on the film plane (or sensor) is nearly as big as the object photographed. There are different ways to achieve this. The most common one is to use a specialised "macro" lens. Such lenses are good at focussing sharply on a small area approaching the size of the film frame. Most 35mm format macro lenses achieve at least 1:2, that is to say, the image on the film is half the size of the object being photographed. Many 35mm macro lenses are 1:1, meaning the image on the film is the same size as the object being photographed. Another important difference is that lenses designed for macro are usually at their sharpest at macro focus distances and are not quite as sharp at other focus distances.

In recent years, the term "macro" has been used in marketing material to mean being able to focus on a subject close enough so that when a regular 6×4 inch (15×10 cm) print is made, the image is life-size or larger. With 35mm film this requires a magnification ratio of only approximately 1:4, which demands less of lens quality than 1:1. With digital cameras the actual image size is rarely stated, so that the magnification ratio is largely irrelevant; cameras instead advertise their closest focussing distance.


There are two main problems with macro photography:

Gulf of California

The Gulf of California (also named as the Sea of Cortez or Sea of Cortés; 
and nearby is known in the Spanish language as Mar de Cortés or Mar Bermejo or Golfo de California) is a area of water that is inbetween the Baja California Peninsula and Mexican mainland. It is surrounded by the states of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sonora, and Sinaloa. The name "Gulf of California" is on most maps in English today. The name "Sea of Cortés" is the one preferred by local people. The Gulf was made 5.3 million years ago, changing the flow of the Colorado River. Other rivers which also flow into the Gulf of California are the Fuerte, Mayo, Sinaloa, Sonora, and the Yaqui. Its area is about 160,000 km² (62,000 square miles).

The Gulf of California was made as parts of the planets surface moved the Baja California Peninsula off of the North American Plate. As part of this process, the East Pacific Rise formed along the middle of the Gulf along the bottom of the sea. The Gulf would go as far as Indio, California if there wasn't a large river delta made by the Colorado River. This delta blocks the sea from flooding the Mexicali and Imperial Valleys. Volcanoes can be found along the East Pacific Rise. The island of Isla Tortuga is one example of the volcanoes found.

The Gulf of California has two large islands, the Isla Ángel de la Guarda and Tiburón Island. It also has several smaller ones, including Isla Espiritu Santo and Isla Partida which is joined to it by a small bit of land.

Jeff Lynne

Jeffrey ("Jeff") Lynne (born 30 December 1947, Birmingham, England) is a British musician (guitar, piano and bass guitar), songwriter and music producer. His longtime band was the Electric Light Orchestra (also known as ELO), but he worked with many other artists, including Duane Eddy, members of the Travelling Wilburys (Lynne himself was one also), and The Beatles.

Lynne first became known as a member of a band called The Idle Race. He taught himself about recording with a simple at home, using "sound on sound" to build up the sound of his own music. He later joined The Move, which then re-formed as Electric Light Orchestra. Lynne did not with ELO's members, as much as he directed how each member should play and sound. His work with ELO was often compared to music by The Beatles. Even John Lennon, the Beatles's founder, called ELO a "Son of Beatles" kind of band, before his death in 1980. Lynne also performed music for two movie soundtracks, "All This and World War II" and "Electric Dreams".

Electric Light Orchestra's fame lessened during the 1980s. Lynne began to produce other, sometimes older recording artists, some of whom had new hits after years without them. A friend introduced Lynne to George Harrison, another former Beatle, who planned a comeback album in the late 1980s. Their collaboration, "Cloud Nine", reawakened interest in Harrison and his music.

After the success of "Cloud Nine", Lynne and Harrison formed the Travelling Wilburys with Tom Petty, Bob Dylan and Roy Orbison. They became a popular group.

Early in the 1990s, the surviving Beatles completed a series telling their own history. George Martin, their original producer, could not play as big a role as he had, because he had lost some of his hearing. Lynne was chosen to work with them. Yoko Ono handed over demos of five unfinished John Lennon songs, and two were chosen for the rest of the band to (add parts to). Lynne used his studio knowhow to develop finished records from the raw demos, and the songs became hits, over twenty years since the Beatles issued a new recording.

Lynne moved to Los Angeles, California, and bought a house, which he turned into a large recording studio, with places to plug in equipment in nearly every room. He formed a new lineup of ELO in the early 2000s, recording a new album and beginning a tour, but interest was short-lived, and many shows were cancelled.

Lynne's music with ELO is popular again, through its use in television commercials. He continues to write and produce new music.

The Palestinian people, (, "ash-sha`b al-filasTīni") also referred to as Palestinians or Palestinian Arabs (, "al-filasTīnīyyūn"; , "al-`Arab al-filasTīnīyyūn"), are an Arabic-speaking people with family origins in Palestine. The total Palestinian population, including descendants, is estimated at approximately 10 million, roughly half continuing to live in the region of historic Palestine, an area encompassing Israel proper, the West Bank including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip and Jordan. In this combined area, as of 2009, they constitute a majority of 51% of all inhabitants, some of whom are internally displaced persons. The remainder, just over half of all Palestinians, comprise what is known as the Palestinian diaspora, most of whom are stateless Palestinian refugees lacking citizenship in any country. Of the diaspora, over two and a half million live in neighboring Jordan, one million is shared between Syria and Lebanon, a quarter million in Saudi Arabia, and Chile's half a million is the largest concentration outside the Arab world.

By religious affiliation, most Palestinians are Muslim, particularly of the Sunni branch of Islam, and there is a significant Palestinian Christian minority of various Christian denominations, as well as smaller religious communities. As the commonly applied term "Palestinian Arab" ethnonym implies, the current traditional vernacular of Palestinians, irrespective of religion, is the Palestinian dialect of Arabic. For those who are citizens of Israel, known also as Arab Israelis, many are now also bilingual in Modern Hebrew. Recent genetic evidence has demonstrated that Palestinians as an ethnic group represent modern "descendants of a core population that lived in the area since prehistoric times," largely predating the Arabian Muslim conquest that resulted in their acculturation and established Arabic as the lingua franca, which eventually became the sole vernacular of the locals, most of whom would over time also convert to Islam from various prior faiths.

The first widespread use of "Palestinian" as an endonym to refer to the nationalist concept of a Palestinian people by the local Arabic-speaking population of Palestine began prior to the outbreak of World War I, and the first demand for national independence was issued by the Syrian-Palestinian Congress on 21 September 1921. After the creation of Israel, the exodus of 1948, and more so after the exodus of 1967, the term came to signify not only a place of origin, but the sense of a shared past and future in the form of a Palestinian nation-state. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) represents the Palestinian people before the international community. The Palestinian National Authority, officially established as a result of the Oslo Accords, is an interim administrative body nominally responsible for governance in Palestinian population centres in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Octet

An octet is a word used to describe the sequence of 8 things in a row.

In music, an octet is an ensemble consisting of eight instruments or voices, or a composition written for such an ensemble.

Octets are used in the technology field very often. For example, the eight binary digits in a byte has been called an octet. The term "octet" is used to avoid ambiguity, because some old computers had different numbers of bits per byte. It is mainly used with describing IP addresses. An IPv4 address consists of four octets (which can be written as their decimal values 255.255.255.255).

In France, French Canada and Romania, "octet" is used in common language instead of "byte" to talk about 8 bits, for example, a megabyte (MB) is called a megaoctet (Mo).

Red beans and rice

Red beans and rice is a dish popular in Louisiana. Red beans are made with red kidney beans, meat (like ham or sausage), and vegetables (like onions, bell pepper, celery or garlic). These things are cooked together slowly in a pot to make the red beans. The red beans are then poured onto cooked white rice. The rice can be steamed or boiled. Once the red beans and the rice are done, the red beans are served over the rice like a sauce. There is usually about an equal amount of red beans and rice, but some people like to have more red beans or more rice. 

Red beans usually take several hours to make. Many people let the beans cook slowly all day. People in New Orleans used to make red beans when they did their laundry. They did this because they did not need to pay attention to the beans while they cooked. The beans could cook slowly while they did the laundry. People in New Orleans used to do laundry on Monday, so it is traditional in New Orleans to eat red beans and rice on Monday. 

A lot of people think that all food from New Orleans is spicy, but red beans usually are not. Red beans are usually served with hot sauce so that people who want spicy red beans can make them spicy.

Kele Okereke does the vocals and plays rhythm guitar, Russell Lissack plays the lead guitar, Gordon Moakes plays bass guitar and Matt Tong plays the drums. Its music has been compared to bands like The Cure, Gang of Four and The Strokes.

The band formed at the 1999 Reading Festival. It went through many names before Bloc Party was chosen in 2003. Moakes joined after reading an advertisement in "NME" magazine. Tong was picked through an audition. Bloc Party was first noticed by giving BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq and Franz Ferdinand's lead singer Alex Kapranos a copy of its music demo, "She's Hearing Voices". This was later released as a single.

In February 2005, the band released its debut album "Silent Alarm". Lots of good things were said about it. It made "NME"'s Album of the Year list. The album was given platinum status in the UK a year later. The band released another album, "A Weekend in the City", in 2007. This reached number two on the UK album chart and number twelve in the "Billboard" 200. In August 2008, the band released its third album, "Intimacy".

Hi. This is my seventh article for Simple News. This time round will be about various things. First of all, I'm very sad that Kennedy has left us. He was a great crat and will always be remembered. Furthermore, he was one of the "main-guys" doing Simple news, and this will make it harder for SN to continue. KENNEDY IS BACK!

This is why I'm asking you to join us now. You can help updating the new admins, the v/GAs, or you could also start writting articles. Any of these would be of great help, and I would be very thankfull if anyone joined :D

Also, a note about (V)GAs. We need more people to review, vote for articles, and just help by commenting.

Also, DYK needs help. We need to discuss some new rules, as the one's we have aren't quite suitable for the number of users helping out currently.

Finally just a message about Juliancolton's challenge. Join . The objective is to create as many of the red links as possible. Kind of inactive, but worth while :).

Thanks, more comming in the next editions! 19:06, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

Next up for the QandA interview is , with new resident interviewer . Lets see how he gets on...

Hi, I'm Juliancolton. :) I'm an administrator at three Wikimedia projects; I passed simplewiki RfA in January, and since then I've edited near daily. My work here includes article-writing, vandal-fighting, and general maintenance work.

That's a tough call. I've always liked the concept of spreading knowledge for free, and I especially enjoy collaborating with other editors on the project. 

I was browsing an external site, and stumbled upon a link to the English Wikipedia. I found it to be very informative, and I typed a couple other things into the search box - I was amazed at the broad coverage the project had. After editing there for a couple years, I worked my way over to simplewiki, and the rest is history!

Well, aside from what I mentioned above, I'm a true wikiholic. ;) More importantly, the work isn't going to do itself, so I like to help out.

Well, it is a volunteer project, so it's not perfect. 

I think it would be nice if we could focus on making decent articles, rather than one-line stubs which basically repeat the title. 

Hmm, well, tropical cyclone articles need quite a bit of work, if anyone's interested. :)

Thanks for the interview! 

Well thanks for that Julian! Look out for more QandA interviews in future editions!

Wikipedia:Simple News/Microchip08/1

This is my first article for , and I thought I would make a little column with no real focus, just exploring anything that comes to mind, and of course, my obligatory plug. I'm not generally a writer, so please bear with me! This issue, I will be covering some simple Wikimarkup shorthand, that people may find useful, along with some rudimentary javascript you can use to customise your viewing experience, although this is very basic and there are probably better ways of doing things.
Wikimarkup can be as basic as two apostrophes, or can be as complicated as intricate parser functions on templates. It is a wide ranging subject, and is extremely versatile. It is easy to pick up, and supports a limited amount of HTML. Everyone who edits Wikipedia regularly knows the way to make <nowiki></nowiki>bold<nowiki></nowiki> and <nowiki>"</nowiki>italics<nowiki>"</nowiki>, so I'm not going to dwell on those: instead I'm going to delve into the world of <nowiki>wikilink</nowiki>s. The normal wikilink, as we all know, is created by placing a double pair of square brackets either side of an article name, making <nowiki>apple</nowiki> into the infinitely more useful apple. Then we get slightly more advanced, creating better links, utilising the "pipe" (that's that character that is swapped round on keyboards for random reasons, the ¦ key that, when pressed, creates a |), and so <nowiki>better links</nowiki>.

That's not the only corner you can cut: when someone wants to link to a namespace, there are easier ways to link to a page without including the prefix (so, if you wanted to mention me on , most people would link to ). Of course, "and I support 's ban" is rather 'clunky' — "Now then, is a rather nice guy" is a lot nicer to look at, and it's only one extra character — the legendary pipe. Write <nowiki></nowiki>, and it automatically removes the namespace. <nowiki></nowiki> creates . It works with anything with a colon too: <nowiki></nowiki> turns into , and <nowiki></nowiki> turns into .

Javascript is the main way to alter the appearance of Wikipedia on a per-user basis. Quite simply, all you need to do is to edit your "monobook.js" (if you are using the default skin), which can be found at . If you're using another skin, you need to edit the page with your skin name, with a few exceptions. All javascript pages are lowercase, and end in .js. Here's a few code snippets that I have in , that currently are not gadgets.

One of the most useful snippets, in my opinion, changes a redlinked discussion tab to, when clicked, go to a new section as supposed to the standard edit page. It was based on English Wikipedia's .
Another thing that I use (and I made this one all by myself), alters the sidebar, amongst other things.

What the above snippet does is add a link to my "personal" toolbar, which is the bar at the top of the screen that says "my talk, my settings" etc., that gives a link to my monobook.js. You can easily adapt this for your own purposes: just copy the following:

and replace TWO with the page you want linking to, THREE with whatever you want the text to be when you hover over it, and ONE with one of the following, depending on where you want the link to appear:

The other section of the javascript "removes" certain aspects, such as the infuriating (for me), create a book section, the Community Portal, that I never use, and the Donate link. It also removes the "From Wikipedia" section: I know what website I am on. This is relatively easy to adapt: find the source of the page (View > Source), search for the correct part of the webpage, and look to see what the ID is (id=???). Then stick it in to the line (instead of n-portal), but leave the quotation marks intact, and make sure you copy both lines.

I hope this enlightens you slightly, and I hope it's been worthwhile. To finish it off, here's one more snippet of Javascript, which adds tabs to the top of the page, giving you a link to the same page in all the sister projects, and en. I've got Wikipedia on there as my wikt: profile synchronises with my Wikipedia javascript. You can change the location of the links by changing p-cactions for one of the other options outlined above.
Thanks.

Warlord

A warlord is a ruler whose status is based solely on power of violence without any legitimacy (that is: right by law). A warlord is a military commander, usually a militant leader, rebel or militia, who has his own private army. The Condottieri of Middle Ages Italy are well known examples of warlords. Many warlords lived (and live) in China and Mongolia. Warlordism is also known in Afghanistan and Somalia.

Warlords appear when a state collapses. Warlordism is the inevitable consequence of anarchy. Many warlords are former officers, clan leaders, mafia bosses or gang leaders. A warlord may attempt to build a state at the area where he is in power, or he may simply plunder and rob his subjects.

A state which has collapsed into warlordism is in continuous civil war. The only industries in such countries are agriculture, mining and contraband, such as drugs and weapons, trade.

The service is operated by 18-carriage Class 373 trains at up to 300 km/h (186 mph) on a network of high-speed lines. Since Eurostar began in 1994, new lines have been built in Belgium (HSL 1) and Southern England (High Speed 1) to the same standard as the LGV Nord line originally used in France, reducing journey times. The two-stage Channel Tunnel Rail Link project was completed on 14 November 2007, when the London terminus of Eurostar transferred from Waterloo International to St Pancras International station.

Narwhal

The Narwhal ("Monodon monoceros") is a rarely seen Arctic whale. This social whale is known for the very long tooth that males have. Very little is known about this whale. Narwhal means "corpse whale" in Old Norse.

All narwhals have two teeth in their upper jaw. After the first year of a male narwhal's life, its left tooth grows outward, spirally. This long, single tooth projects from its upper jaw and can grow to be 8.75 feet (2.7 meters) long. Tusks are usually twisted in a counterclockwise direction and are hollow inside. The tusk's function is uncertain, perhaps used as a formidable jousting weapon in courtship and dominance rivalry, in getting food, and/or for channeling and amplifying sonar pulses (which they emit). The tusk is not used in hunting. Long ago, narwhal sightings probably reinforced (or started) the unicorn legends. In fact, when people found the horn of a dead narwhal washed up on shore, they thought that they had found the horn of a unicorn.

Narwhal can dive deep into the sea to around 800 meters, but can also sometimes dive up to 1,500 meters. This makes them one of the deepest diving sea mammals.

Narwhals live in the icy waters of the Arctic seas. They do not go far away from ice. Narwhals are migrating animals who like to move from one place to live in another place for a while. 

When it is warm in summer, groups of them move closer to land, where they can sometimes be seen in the estuaries, deep fjords, and bays of Greenland and Northern Canada. 

These groups can be as big as 10 or even as big as 100 sometimes. But when Winter comes around again, they move back to the Icy waters, where they breath from small holes in the ice. Every so often lucky people get to see them in North-West Russia.

Narwhals like to eat Arctic fish such as Arctic Cod, but they also like to eat both shrimp and squid. 

Narwhals are both hunted by polar bears and killer whales. Sometimes however, even humans hunt Narwhals. The native Inuit people who are sometimes called the Eskimos, are allow to hunt the Narwhals for food.

Vailala Madness

The Vailala Madness was a religious movement. It was active between 1919 and 1922. Many people think it was one the first cargo cults, even though that term was first used in the 1940s. The Vailala Madness was active in the Papuan Gulf, which was a territory of Australia at the time, but now belongs to Papua New Guinea. 

The Vailala Madness got its name from the behaviour of people who took part in it. This behaviour included glossolalia (or "speaking in tongues"), shaking, and signs of mental or emotional disturbances . In the indigenous language, people who were taking part in the Vailala Madness called it "iki haveve", or "belly-don't know," which was another way of saying "dizziness."

The people in the movement thought that a 'Ghost Steamer' would come. This ship would be piloted by dead people who were coming back. The dead people would bring with them cargo with tinned food and tools. In one version of the story, the dead people would bring guns to kick the white colonizers out, but not everybody agrees that this was what people in the Vailala Madness actually believed.

Bradshaw Trail

The Bradshaw Trail, nicknamed the Gold Road at one time, is a historic trail which used to be a stagecoach route in Southern California.

This road used to connect San Bernardino, California to gold fields in La Paz, Arizona, known today as Ehrenberg. It was the first road connecting Riverside County to the Colorado River.

The part which remains today is a graded dirt road which crosses southeastern Riverside County and a part of Imperial County, beginning roughly 12 miles/19km east of North Shore and ending about 14 miles/23km southwest of Blythe for a total of 70 miles/113km.

The trail is named for trailblazer William David Bradshaw who first crossed the area in 1862. A former forty-niner, Bradshaw knew that the northern gold mines were rapidly emptying and that miners and other people leaving the area would need a more direct trail from the south across the desert to the new gold strike at La Paz. Without a direct trail, they would have to travel a great distance southeast to Yuma, then north up the river to La Paz. Bradshaw was a smart man; he knew there were lots of chances to make money in a gold boomtown.

Originally 180 miles/290km long, the western end of the trail began east of San Bernardino in the San Gorgonio Pass. Bradshaw and his party travelled southeast to the northern tip of the Salton Sink, turning due east to the foothills of the Orocopia Mountains and an existing stage stop called "Dos Palmas." 

Leaving Dos Palmas, the men continued eastward between the Orocopia and Chocolate mountain ranges, briefly passing by the southern end of the Chuckwalla range and ending at the Palo Verde Valley. Once they crossed the Colorado River, the party rode upstream for about four miles to the gold fields. Despite the fact that the trail crossed mostly barren desert, there was lots of water to be found at water holes found at roughly thirty-mile/48km intervals.

Between 1862 and 1877, the Bradshaw Trail was the main route between Southern California and the La Paz gold fields.

The remaining part of the Bradshaw Trail mostly crosses public land. The extreme eastern end of the trail at Ripley does not. Use of a four wheel drive vehicle is recommended to travel across the trail. There are no services on the trail itself. 

Another fact to consider is the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range which borders a part of the Bradshaw Trail to the south. This is a live bombing range and is clearly marked.

Wiley's Well

Wiley's Well is a remote, natural artesian well in the Colorado Desert of Southern California. It is also the name of the area around it.

It is named after Palo Verde storekeeper and postmaster A.P. Wiley. In 1907, Mr. Wiley dug deep into a shallow well dug in 1876 by a stagecoach company which used the nearby Bradshaw Trail. Wiley made the well larger since he hoped that he could attract business to his remote desert store. The well was taken care of by local ranchers and cattlemen for years afterward. However, the rapidly falling level of the water meant a drop of the water's depth to 60'/18m within a dozen years. Today, the well's original depth is only about 20'/6m at best after wet weather. The water in the well is not good for drinking.

In 1985, the Bureau of Land Management drilled a new well 965'/294m deep to support the new Wiley's Well Campground, one of only two developed campgrounds in the Mule Mountains Long-Term Visitor Area. The water is both hot at 90°F/32°C and full of minerals. The water is pumped into a cistern to help cool it to drinking temperature.
Wiley's Well is popular with rockhounds. They have been coming to Wiley's Well since the 1930s with the discovery of geode beds. Even though Wiley's Well has been very popular with rockhounds over the decades, the area remains rich with such minerals as chalcedony, citrine, quartz crystals, rhyolite and jasper. Though winters are mild, making the campground popular with visitors who visit every year from colder areas, summer can be extremely hot with recorded temperatures as high as 130°F/54°C. 

Wiley's Well is easy to reach. It is off the Wiley's Well Road exit from Interstate 10, sixteen miles/26km west of Blythe. The entrance to the campground is nine miles/14km south of the highway.

Alphonse of Poitiers

Alphonse of Poitiers or Alfonso or Alphonse (11 November 1220 – 21 August 1271) was the Count of Poitou from 1225 and Count of Toulouse (as Alfonso II) from 1247.

Alphonse was a son of Louis VIII, King of France and Blanche of Castile. He was a younger brother of Louis IX of France and an older brother of Charles I of Sicily.

The Treaty of Paris stipulated that a brother of King Louis was to marry Joan of Toulouse, daughter of Raymond VII of Toulouse, and so in 1237 Alphonse married her.

Honest and moderate, protecting the middle classes against exactions of the nobles, he exercised a happy influence upon the south, in spite of his naturally despotic character and his continual and pressing need of money. He is noted for ordering the first recorded local expulsion of Jews, when he did so in Poitou in 1249.

Aside from the crusades, Alfonso stayed primarily in Paris, governing his estates by officials, inspectors who reviewed the officials work, and a constant stream of messages.

When Louis IX again engaged in a crusade (the Eighth Crusade), Alphonse again raised a large sum of money and accompanied his brother. This time, however, he did not return to France, dying while on his way back, probably at Savona in Italy, on 21 August 1271.

Karst Tates (born, March 6, 1971 - died, May 1, 2009) was a Dutchman who tried to harm the Dutch Royal Family (including Willem Alexander and Beatrix) by making his car collide with the Royal Bus. This event happened in Apeldoorn, Netherlands on 30 April, 2009, the Dutch national holiday of Queen's Day ("Koninginnedag"). He did not succeed, but killed 7 people who were watching the festivities and himself.

According to a policeman who claimed having talked to Tates, Tates said immediately after the crash that he had wanted to hit the members of the Royal Family that had just passed there in an open bus, because Willem-Alexander was a racist and a fascist in his view. After having been brought to hospital, Tates died from his wounds.

List of counties of the United Kingdom

Lists of the Counties and Principal Areas of the United Kingdom:

The United Kingdom has different sorts of counties. Some are traditional areas and some are for local government or other government things.

These counties are sometimes called "historic counties", "traditional counties" or "ancient or geographical counties". People argue about how much they exist in law. They are useful for genealogical and historic matters. Anyone may choose to use traditional counties or not.

The traditional counties have had nothing to do with government since 1889. However until 1974 most local government counties were very like them.

The United Kingdom has 92 traditional counties.

"See also:"
The areas used for local government are different in different parts of the United Kingdom. They have different names too.

Northern Ireland is one region and there are 26 districts within it. In parts of England there are local government counties with districts in them. In other parts there are counties with just one district, and in those parts there is only one council, which is the district council or the county council. Greater London is not a county; it has London Borough Councils, and a Greater London Authority. In Scotland there are "local government areas" but most people call them "council areas". In Wales there are "principal areas". Some councils' areas in Wales are called "counties" and others "county boroughs".

The Queen appoints officers called "lord-lieutenants". The areas in which they have their duties are usually called "ceremonial county", except in Scotland, where they are "lieutenancy areas". A lord-lieutenant and a high sheriff is appointed to each ceremonial county. In Scotland a lord-lieutenant only is appointed to each lieutenancy area.

A ceremonial county in England and Wales is a local government county or a group of local government counties. In Northern Ireland it is a county or county borough.

Light-dependent reactions

In the light-dependent reaction, light energy from the sun is used to split water (photolysis) which has been sucked in by plants by transpiration. Water, when broken, makes oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons. These electrons move through structures in chloroplasts and by chemiosmosis, make ATP.

The hydrogen is converted to NADPH which is then used in the light-independent reactions. Oxygen diffuses out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis. This all happens in the grana of chloroplasts.

‘Holes’ in the reaction centres are always being filled by electrons from water molecules:

Colin Flannery was the first to propose the idea that photoosynthesis needs light, in 1779. He recognized it was sunlight falling on plants that was required, although Joseph Priestly had noted the production of oxygen without the association with light in 1772.
Cornelius Van Niel proposed in 1931 that photosynthesis is a case of general mechanism where a photon of light is used to photo decompose a hydrogen donor and the hydrogen being used to reduce .
Then in 1939 Robin Hill showed that isolated chloroplasts would make oxygen, but not fix showing the light and dark reactions occurred in different places. This led later to the discovery of photosystem 1 and 2.

<doc id="183006" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183006" title="Light-independent reaction">
Light-independent reaction

Light-independent reactions take place within the chloroplasts. During this reaction, sugars are made using carbon dioxide and the products of the light-dependent reactions (ATP and NADPH) and various other chemicals found in the plant during the Calvin cycle. Therefore, the light-independent reaction cannot happen without the light-dependent reaction. Sugars made in the light-independent reactions are moved around the plant by translocation.

There is a well known team building exercise that involves people writing down compliments about each other and placing them in envelopes to present to a person. This is often a way to help get the team together and to make them feel good about themselves. Because Simple English Wikipedia is, at the moment, in a low point, I would like people to do the same for each other. To do this, I have made a website to collect everyone's answers. I will collate them and present them as anonymous compliments to them. You can do the survey here. There are three pages. Thank you in advance,

Hello all,

I have found out that the following seem to often be subjects for articles:
Personally, I do see a few problems with such articles:
Please remember that at the same time, this Wikipedia lacks major articles about history and culture in general.
Is there a way to get a "to-do-list" of articles that we still need to be usable by our target audience? - I mean you cannot blame people for using EnWP (or any other language version), if we simply do not have the content?

Just thoughts, as always.-- () 10:06, 9 May 2009 (UTC)

Hello all,

just wanted to remind you that Abortion has been moved to be voted on as a , and that the vote for Bloc Party as a is running for another two days. 

It would really be nice if you could express your opinion on these as well as other candidates in the respective categories. -- () 09:02, 10 May 2009 (UTC)

I have just realised why I don't really work on articles here. It's because Simple English Wikipedia's audience simply cannot work as we are now. According to the Main Page, our audience is for people who are a) Learning English b) Children. This simply cannot work though. Why? The existence of articles such as Autofellatio, Goatse etc. Why on earth would someone want to improve their English by learning about someone sucking their parts, or looking up a man's behind? And obviously, such articles are totally inappropriate for children.

A fairly radical change is needed. I attended the Wikimedia UK AGM on Sunday, where there was a rep from Schools Wikipedia. He mentioned that they used articles from enwiki, and I wondered why they didn't use us? The level of English in our articles is great for school-age children. He explained that our coverage was "sparse". This is because we concentrate our efforts on things that aren't *that* important (e.g. stubs on communes, asteroids, rivers etc), instead of important articles such as politics, protein or potato.

What I suggest:


There are probably more things, but I'm just putting these thought out in the open. The problem is, I don't know "why" I'm contributing to Simple. On English Wikipedia, my articles will be read by anyone interested in the topic who does a google search. On Simple, not so. It's just ridiculous to say this site is for children, when we have articles on sex positions. We need to stop messing about, and get ourselves a proper aim. My suggestion is make the audience school age children, and articles within the scope of anything that could be conceivably learned about, or discussed in a school. 15:14, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

An even more radical suggestion: I suggest we do not allow stubs anymore. If one wants to work on an article over a period, they should have some time to leave a temporary "stub" notice, but once again, we should be thinking quality, not quantity. Some seem to be on a mission to create every bit of rock or cell that ever existed, and will be perma-stubs of six words that don't teach anyone anything, or are identical to enwiki, which would obviously be first in the results of a search engine. 15:41, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

Majorly has some good points and I'd agree we need a purpose. Failing that, Simple is just a poor version of EN. If I had kids, I'd prefer them to use EN than here just because the articles are of a superior quality. Here, it seems, editors can churn out any old rubbish just to boost edit counts. However, I would point out that aiming to an audience of 11-16 is not easy, and there is a reason why teachers are of a certain age and academic background. All in all, I'd support and would go so far as to suggest a "reboot" so that these radical changes can be implemented. () 15:44, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

My thought is that we should hijack the already dead and nominate articles, one at a time, such as World War II, and work on them collaboratively for a couple of weeks each. () 16:05, 28 April 2009 (UTC)
Here is a hopefully workable proposal:

Comments 1) I'd drop the second part and keep the children. 2) I may be wrong, but it seems the majority of our active community haven't actually got a high school education - yet - so that's a lofty goal. 3) Yes, could be delete. 4) Tough love is sometimes the way.

Also, I'd want to create a better definition of what we are, who we are for, then a new QD category to remove articles "out of scope" () 16:13, 28 April 2009 (UTC)
(<-) I think it is not the time to make lists of articles; would you be able to agree on:
@CM16: I do see wrestling as some kind of sports, and I would love to have a GA or VGA on a wrestling-related subject. -- () 21:56, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

Commment I see a problem in all this. If the "for children" part of the reason for the project is dropped, would the project do enough to justify it remaining WMF-sanctioned? As things stand, it is easier for those with a less-than-comprehensive understanding of English to use the well-written EN project than the one we offer here. Removing "for all ages" would put this project on very shaky foundations, in my opinion () 20:21, 7 May 2009 (UTC)

I'd like to start a few straw polls. Although this is generally a poor way of coming to consensus, I feel that this discussion has reached a bit of a stand-still and I'd like to get an idea of how the community feels on a few proposals: 
For a while, Simple English has been a place where banned en users could continue to edit. Some people may say that we are a refuge and give deserving people a second change. Others would say that someone banned from en should be banned from all WMF projects. Our current policy reads as follows:
The proposal is to reword our policy to generally not allow banned users from EN to edit on Simple. Also, temporarily blocked users would not be allowed to edit on Simple, either, until the expiry of their block on EN. Those who are able to edit here before an administrator notices the EN block may be permitted to keep editing on a one-strike rule, at the administrator's discretion. Please leave comments beside your "vote". 03:18, 2 May 2009 (UTC)



There has been some discussion about the scope of our project. Some believe we should focus on children (6-11), others on teenagers (12-16), others on adults with learning difficulties or adults who speak english as a second language. I believe the best option is to write articles that would be readable by people of all ages. Our current scope is defined as:
I think a lot of common sense is needed here. Articles should, for the most part, be written for an adult audience. Most children will not want to read about Rembrandt while many teenagers or adults will. On the other hand, children will want to read about the Sun but to a much more superficial level than an adult reader would also want to read about the Sun. As such, I suggest that we provide, when appropriate, two versions of the article. One that explains complex ideas in simple words (our usual article) plus an additional version that contains only simple ideas in simple words. This would be similar to how the first line of says "For a generally accessible and less technical introduction to the topic, see ." Please leave comments with your "vote". 03:18, 2 May 2009 (UTC)


Hello all,

what I write below is longer, as usual, and it is my opinion, so you are free to disagree. I think we ought to do something about the general way the GA/VGA process works. What I say below both apply to GAs and VGAs. The two processes are only different in two or three minor things ,but otherwise work the same way. FOr this reason, I will only speak about VGAs below, but still mean GAs all the same.

At the moment, the process (or the expected process works as follows):

I think we really need to revise the process, as a whole. In general, I see the following changes:

Please note that the current candidates would still use the current criteria; any new criteria or procedures would only apply to candidates submitted after a certain date to be agreed on. 

As always, these are just my observations. In the interest of keeping the GA/VGA process alive, I think we had better adapt it. I am open for other peoples' ideas. -- () 10:14, 11 May 2009 (UTC)

This seems to have been inactive for the past 4 or 5 months. However, I'm thinking of maybe taking it over since Gwib's retired and "rehabilitating" it. Would that be OK, and how many would be interested in improving such articles? 20:43, 11 May 2009 (UTC)

After a month's leave, I am back and resuming my duties here on the Simple English Wikipedia. Much has changed since I have been gone (just today discovered that ChristianMan16 got banned indefinitely), but it is still pretty much the same encyclopedia that it was when I left it a month ago. Anyways, hope to see you around the site! Cheers, 16:44, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

Hello there all. After reverting unsourced additions or removals from year and day pages (1999 and July 21, as examples), I believe that we should enforce a kind of "guideline" for the addition of material to year or day pages.

Here are my suggestions:


We could relax the second guideline a bit by removing the requirement of a source on that page. I just put it on there to complete the idea. Good idea, bad idea, suggestions? Thanks, 18:40, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

Alright, considering that this is starting to look like someone requesting a mass deletion of all the "one-line stubs", I would like to say that if they exist on the English Wikipedia, why can't they exist here? Furthermore, people have been very opposed to the removal of short stubs because even though they are short now, someone could stumble upon them to add information on them in the future. I think that deleting the articles just because of how short they are is counter-productive towards our goal here of creating a comprehensive encyclopedia in Simple English. If these stubs meet all of the requirements in order to get a page on this Wikipedia, why should they be deleted? What rules do they break other than the shortness of the articles. People just need to learn to accept that a Wikipedia will always have short articles like these short stubs and move on with their lives. It is counter-productive to squabble about short stubs when we can be improving existing articles or writing new ones. 

Some people are better at writing stubs than they are fully fledged articles, and therefore, if we stop allowing stubs to be created or make it so that they have to be a certain length in order to stay on this site, you are pushing away potential good editors from this site. Writing short stubs like these are in the Wikipedia spirits, so why should it matter if they exist on the Simple English Wikipedia? 19:36, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

Question for Razorflame. Why did you create all of the stubs when you did? If we can understand your motivation, we may be able to change attitudes in the future () 21:49, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

While I hate the idea of deleting stubs, I don't think I realized the numbers of each of those types were that big...that was rediculous to create that many and at numbers that high it quite clearly had to be editcoutitis. - () 03:56, 13 May 2009 (UTC)

I will explain why this is a big deal. On the English Wikipedia, there are millions of articles on a broad range of topics. On this project, we have a few thousand articles, so this mass-creation of stubs is "polluting" the project with tiny articles that are of no use to our readers. Simple English Wikipedia is slowly but surely becoming an asteroid and Romanian river depository with a few other articles alongside. This is not a healthy way forward.  () 12:15, 13 May 2009 (UTC)

One of the things I think you are missing Razor, is that they are stubs of all the same subject. Having 50% of the project as stubs would not be a big deal if they weren't all romanian rivers or asteroids. If you could atleast admit that you knew creating this one line stubs was just a way to inflate your (our) numbers then maybe going forward might be easier. It's fairly obvious that these stubs were easy targets as they were one sentence long and didn't require simpliication from the english version. - () 14:04, 13 May 2009 (UTC)

Simple has lots of problems. One, Simple does not have enough users that know how to write articles, Two, Simple is a difficult project to create articles for, because the project rules makes it difficult to write quality articles. Although, I do not like stubs, the average reader at Simple is not going to care. Remember, this is Simple, and not the English Wikipedia. We shouldn't rely on what en. does. We are a different project with different goals and different ways of doing things. () 19:51, 13 May 2009 (UTC)

Just a quick question, I saw this article, and wasn't sure of its notability. Do you think it should have its own article, or just split into kidney beans and rice? I've done a quick cleanup on it anyway, just incase. 09:04, 13 May 2009 (UTC)

Does anybody know what to do for the selected article on the Main Page? All there is a red link to Main Page/Article 26... — () 02:39, 14 May 2009 (UTC)

Hello all,

there are very few candidate proposals to the GA/VGA process (and consequently even fewer promotions). So let's look at it from another side; rather than "finding articles that might be suitable", let's ask the community what broad "subject areas" they want covered with a GA or VGA. People are more likely to work on articles they are interested in, even that may mean more work. I will make a start, and tell you what I personally think we still need:
Keep in mind that if we do a VGA about a subject, the article will be tagged in other wikipedias. That way we might attract editors as well. But please do leave comments, as it may help "finding common subjects" for better quality articles many people will be interested in. -- () 10:01, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

Hi. I propose the 800 character rule for DYK be dropped as otherwise the project will die (unless the people oppsing the change of the rule are willing to maintain it, find hooks, etc...). With the couple of editors helping out, it's very complicated. Regards, 10:51, 13 May 2009 (UTC)
It is very easy to find a hook "close" to the needed 800 characters (lets say 600) and expand it using the wikipedia article and references. I just wrote a DYK candidate (Wijerd Jelckama). Can someone make it more readable, easier without making it shorter? I'm having trouble with that because I am no native speaker of English. () 12:14, 13 May 2009 (UTC)


Would it not be better to change to the norm to 1000 characters instead? () 07:49, 14 May 2009 (UTC)

It seems as if general consensus here is keeping the criteria at the 800 character rule, or in other words, we keep it as is. Thanks. — () 05:56, 18 May 2009 (UTC)

Ok, it's clear that our RfA system is broken. It's been clear for a while now. But Mentifisto's has done it for me. Just look at the !vote strikes & changes. Users should not be !voting until they are sure of their vote. They should be looking through contributions and assessing the user, not just jumping on the bandwaggon. I don't know how to solve this. Not opening !voting until after a few days? Changing to a discussion format rather than a !vote. All I know, is that we need to fix it, because frankly, i'm getting fed up of this wiki. Big changes need to happen, and NOW. 11:47, 14 May 2009 (UTC)

Could someone who is good at templates, create a Infobox for a Military Person? We have a page for it, but at the moment it is blank. Thanks in advance, -- () 03:41, 18 May 2009 (UTC)

<doc id="183054" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183054" title="Falafel">
Falafel

Falafel is a kind of vegetarian food. The word is pronounced ; . In Egyptian and Sudanese Arabic it is called "Ta'miyya", "Falafel". 
Falafel is made from chickpeas or fava beans. Spices are added to these. Falafel is either made into a ball, or a disc, which is then fried. The dish originally came from Egypt. Today, it is a popular form of fast food in the Middle East, where it is also served as a mezze. 

The Arabic word "falafel" ("falāfil") may be the plural of () 'pepper'. More relevantly, it is an adjective for "fluffy"/"crunchy" things, as in (), a kind of cooked rice, and (), curly hair. Different spellings in English include "felafel" and "filafil".

Falafel is usually served in a pita-like bread called lafa, either inside the bread, which acts as a pocket, or wrapped in a flat bread. In many countries falafel is a popular street food or fast food. The falafel balls, whole or crushed, may be topped with salads, pickled vegetables and hot sauce, and drizzled with tahini-based sauces. Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a snack or served as part of a mezze. During Ramadan, they are sometimes eaten as part of an iftar, the meal which breaks the daily fast after sunset.

Falafel was originally made with fava beans. When the dish was used more to the north, chickpeas were more common, so they were used instead. The chickpea was used as a food item in the Levant before 4000 BC.

According to Ynetnews, "A common theory suggests falafel was invented some 1000 years ago by the Egyptian Copts. They took it with them when they moved to the rest of the Middle East. Another theory dates the invention of falafel as far as the 6th century AD, or even earlier, placing it on the subcontinent of India, which is known until today for making various chickpea-based dishes".

Falafel is made from fava beans or chickpeas or a combination of the two. In Egypt, fava beans are used exclusively. Other variations may contain only chickpeas. This is the case of Plaestinians, Yemenite Jews in Jerusalem as well as in Syria and Lebanon. In the Levant, Falafel is generally made only with chickpeas. Unlike many other bean patties, in falafel the beans are not cooked before they are used. Instead they are soaked, possibly skinned, then ground, a small quantity of onions,parsley, spices (including cumin), and bicarbonate of soda are added. It is then deep fried at a high temperature. Sesame seeds may be added to the balls before they are fried; this is particularly common when falafel is served as a dish on its own rather than as a sandwich filling.

Recent culinary trends have seen the chickpea falafel have more success than fava bean falafel. Chickpea falafels are served across the Middle East, and have been popularized by expatriates of those countries living abroad. However, fava-bean falafel continue to predominate in Egypt and Sudan and their respective expatriate communities, and Egyptians are fond of deriding chickpea falafel as inferior.

In Israel small 2 1/2 cm spherical balls are made, while in Egypt and among Palestinians larger patties are shaped with a tablespoon or a special scoop with a lever to release them into the hot oil. 

The kind of bread used for falafel may be different. Outside the Middle East, pita bread is often used as a pocket and stuffed with the different ingredients; in Arab countries a round khubz bread, 'eish' in Egypt, is halved, and the two resulting round pieces are used to create a cigar-shaped wrap. There, hummus (chickpeas pureed with tahini) is rarely used as a condiment, the usual sauce is tahini (sesame seed paste) thinned with water and lemon. The most common salad ingredients are tomato and parsley. In Lebanon, parsley is mixed with chopped mint leaves. It is also common in Syria and Lebanon to add pickles; the two canonical ones are pickled turnip, colored pink with beetroot, and pickled cucumber. Recently, there has been a new "filled" falafel, its center usually consisting of ground meat or minced onions or a boiled egg. These fillings are wrapped by the uncooked falafel mixture, and then deep fried.

The salads or the pita itself may be seasoned with salt or sumac, which is very commonly used in Syria; alternatively, these may be sprinkled on top.

Meze

Meze or mezze (Arabic, مَزة, Greek "mezé" (μεζέ), Bulgarian мезé "mezé", Macedonian мéзе "méze", from Turkish "meze", all from Persian "maze" (مزه) 'taste, snack' < "mazīdan" 'to taste') is the name for a number of small dishes or appetizers served before a meal, often with a drink. They are common in the Eastern Mediterranean. Drinks include anise-flavored liqueurs, such as "arak", "ouzo", "raki" or different wines. These dishes are similar to the "tapas" of Spain or finger food.

In Levantine cuisines and in the Caucasus region (especially in Armenia and Georgia), these dishes are served as a part of any large-scale meal. When not accompanied by alcohol, meze is known in the Arab world as "muqabbilat" (Arabic for "starters").

Finger food

Finger food is the name for a number of foods that are usually eaten with the hands, as opposed to using utensils, like forks, knives or chopsticks. In some cultures, food is almost always eaten with the hands; for example, Ethiopian cuisine is eaten by rolling various dishes up in "injera" bread.

Examples of finger food are small beef pies, sausage rolls, sausages on sticks, cheese and olives on sticks, chicken drumsticks or wings, spring rolls, small quiches, samosas, onion bhajis, potato wedges, vol au vents, and risotto balls. Other well-known foods that are generally eaten with the hands include pizza, hot dogs, fruit and bread.

Krebs cycle

The Krebs cycle, or citric acid cycle, is a part of cellular respiration. It comes after the link reaction and provides the hydrogen and electrons needed for the electron transport chain. It happens inside mitochondria. 

The details of the reactions are beyond the scope of this wiki, but the diagram below shows how this part of respiration is an ever-repeating cycle which produces ATP and gives off CO. The ATP is a molecule which carries energy in chemical form to be used in other cell processes. To summarize:

Acetyl

In organic chemistry, acetyl (ethanoyl), is a functional group, the acyl of acetic acid, with chemical formula -COCH.

The acetyl group contains a methyl group bonded to a carbonyl with a lone electron left over. This electron forms a chemical bond to the rest ("R") of the molecule.

The acetyl group is part of any organic compounds such as acetylcholine and acetyl-CoA.

Multiple birth

Multiple birth is when one woman gives birth to more than one child at the same time. Depending on the number of children born, it can be called twins (two), triplets (three), quadruplets (four), and so on. There have been cases known in which woman gave birth to eight children at once. These have a higher risk of dying.

The chance of multiple birth grows when artificial insemination is used. It is therefore used in China to outsmart the one-child policy.

Pita

Pita is a kind of flat bread. Sometimes it is called pitta or pide (Turkish), pitka (Bulgarian) and pronounced "pitta" in Greek). Pita is an often round, brown, wheat flatbread made with yeast.

Pita is traditionally made in the Middle East and around the Mediterranean. It is also used in the cuisines of these countries. It can also be found in North Africa and the Levant. 

Possibly it was spread by the Ancient Greek city states colonies, or by the spread of the Islam through the region. 

In Greek cuisine, pita may refer to thicker breads made with yeast, for example souvlaki pita. It may also refer to foods using many thin layers of dough, usually with many different ingredients in between. That way, pies such as tyropita and spanakopita or sweet pies such as baclava are made.

The Indian flatbread form of roti is sometimes referred to as "Indian pita".

1916 rising

The Easter Rising was a big rebellion in Dublin, Ireland at Easter in 1916. It was carried out by members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and members of the Irish Citizens Army. It was done in opposition to British rule in Ireland. It was the first uprising in Ireland since the 1798 rebellion.

Beforehand, the Irish had planned to have a bigger amount of men to attack the city. But a man called Sir Roger Casement was captured on the way back from Germany with guns and the Irish had very few guns. As a result, only about 1,250 men took part in the rising. Out of these about 300 went into the General Post Office (GPO) in Dublin led by Patrick Pearse and James Connolly. Other groups took over different parts of the city, for example St. Stephen's Green, Shelbourne Hotel, Boland's Mills and Jacobs Factory. At first the British put up no resistance because of Easter public holiday, but soon more of them came into Dublin to fight the Irish. 

The biggest fighting happened at Bolands Mills where Éamon de Valera had his men open fire on British soldiers called "Sherwood Foresters" while they landed in the city. The shootings here killed about 200 people and wounded several more. St. Stephen's Green was a big part of the fighting as well where the Irish lost a lot of men. After six days the Irish were exhausted and were being shot at by huge artillery pieces mounted onto a British ship called HMS Helga. The GPO was badly hit and soon the Irish surrendered. Sixteen of the Irish leaders were shot by firing squad after the Rising.

The British admitted that they lost 155 men to Irish gunfire and 200 were wounded. The Irish rebels lost at least 70 men and over 1,000 of them were wounded. At least 100 Irish citizens were killed in the crossfire as well. After the rising, Dublin was in very bad shape and several hundred people had been killed. But after the British shot the sixteen leaders of the rising the Irish people soon felt sorry for the rebels and followed them. The 1916 rising was a major reason for the Irish War of Independence.

A browser game is a video game that is played on a web browser. It is different from other video and computer games in that it normally does not need any software to be installed on the user's computer, except for the web browser. There are games that rely solely on client-side technologies such as JavaScript or common plugins such as Java or Flash Player, whereas some employ server-side scripting. The latter case consists typically of (massive) multiplayer games, whereas the client-side games are typically single-player games. A game played in a browser is often called a browser-based game.

Weedy sea dragon

The Weedy sea dragon or common sea dragon, Phyllopteryx taeniolatus, is a marine fish related to the seahorse. It is the only member of the genus Phyllopteryx. It is found in water 3 to 50 m deep around the south coast of Australia, from Port Stephens, New South Wales to Geraldton, Western Australia. It also found in the waters around Tasmania. Weedy sea dragons are named for the weed-like growth on their bodies. This camouflage hides them as they move among the seaweed beds where they live. The weedy sea dragon is the aquatic emblem for the state of Victoria.

Weedy sea dragons can reach 45 cm in length. They feed on tiny crustaceans and other zooplankton, which they suck into the end of their long tube-like nose. They don't have a tail that can wrap around and hold on to things the way a seahorse can. They swim in shallow reefs and weed beds, and look like weeds drifting over bare sand.

Sea dragons, seahorses and pipe fish are the only species where the male carries the eggs. The male carries the fertilized eggs, joined under his tail. They stay there for about eight weeks until they . The young can look after themselves as soon as they are born. Breeding sea dragons in captivity is rare because scientists don't know what makes them breed in the wild. Keeping sea dragons in captivity is difficult as only about 60% will survive.

The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California, Melbourne Aquarium in Australia, and the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, Tennessee, are the only places in the world to have bred weedy sea dragons, though others have been able to get them to lay eggs..

A relative of the weedy sea dragon is the leafy sea dragon "Phycodurus eques". In the November 2006, the "National Geographic" magazine, reported that marine biologist Greg Rouse is looking at the DNA of the two sea dragon species.

Cosmic microwave background radiation

Cosmic background microwave radiation (CMB radiation) is radiation in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which comes from all directions in outer space. We know that it comes from very far away, so we think that it is the oldest signal that we can detect.

According to the Big Bang theory, when the universe began, a lot of high-energy radiation was created. Then, the universe became bigger and colder. Therefore, the high-energy radiation lost a lot of its original energy. Now, as a result, that radiation is in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum (the microwave part has quite low energy).

Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson first detected the CMB radiation. Scientists think that the existence of CMB radiation is very important evidence that the Big Bang theory is true.

Brain Warp

Brain Warp is an electronic toy made by Tiger Electronics and released in 1996. Players follow the spoken words of the game unit by choosing the correct number or color. Its catch phrase is "If you don't keep up with me, you're finished!"

The spherical unit has six colored knobs - purple, red, green, white, orange and yellow - with numbers on them, and a blue base. A second version was released in 2002 with a translucent black base. The voice calls out a color, a number, or both, depending on the game selected, and the player flips the unit so that the correct knob is facing upwards. After every four points, the game becomes faster. If the player responds incorrectly, the round is ended and the unit will make a laughing sound. There are six games in total - three where the player has to follow the command, one memory game that uses a combination of colors and numbers, a code buster game and a game called Pass Attack where players have to make up their own pattern.

The game was the most popular in Duracell's Kids' Choice National Toy Survey in 1996.

Flooding lots of pages with info about the 350 organization. -- () 07:02, 26 August 2009 (UTC)


Appears to be the same user posting questions on talk pages inappropriately. I'll warn one user account, then it'll come back with another name. UNOWEN may or may not be related, but the other formatting of the signature here is similar to Edson's signatures. () 17:08, 23 August 2009 (UTC)

If you look at the changes of those users, these users are making test edits to their talk pages, which are edits that make them look like the same person. and have just been deleted. ( • ) 20:54, 16 August 2009 (UTC)

(<-) I unblocked both of them; I did run a checkuser, but I think the results are not relevant here, unless it can be shown one or both of them committed a blockable offense.-- () 21:13, 16 August 2009 (UTC)
The account edits aren't actually at all problematic. It looks like they were sandboxing an article, which isn't in any way a problem. Please don't be so hasty to take action next time. "Nothing" needed to be done here. 22:06, 16 August 2009 (UTC)


Looks like another Disney vandal sock; recently started vandalizing.    18:13, 5 August 2009 (UTC)


I would like to know if JANUSROMA is the same user as PINEAPPLEMAN/their sockpuppets. 01:33, 2 August 2009 (UTC)


Both users create an RfA after <10 edits. I'd also like if Parker is checked with Aleksa Lukic. 16:23, 30 July 2009 (UTC)


Similar style of vandalism, calling users "c**t"s. Time to put an end to this. 14:34, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

The IP vandalized and I gave it a final warning. At about the same time, the account was created and it undid 3 of my edits. I suspect that they are the same. () 05:52, 30 July 2009 (UTC)


Repeated POV pushing towards RKO (whatever that is) on Disney related articles suggests that this is the Disney vandal. Please verify.     14:51, 27 July 2009 (UTC)


I request the release of IP information for these accounts with the intent of formulating a targeted rangeblock to protect this project from further disruption, and formulation of a complaint to the Internet Service Provider... in accordance with bullet 5 in the section titled "Access to and release of personally identifiable information" of the . The article being vandalised is Asperger syndrome and it's talk page. The edits are in the deleted history. Thank you for your time, () 04:19, 25 July 2009 (UTC)
I would like to know if these are the same user, and the range they are editing from. As, I wish to perform a range block. 06:17, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

Both created the same page Panteha Golizadeh. Should be the same user, I think. () 21:48, 24 July 2009 (UTC)

Both accounts were created at the same time, and the edits do not overlap, although they do come close. Both accounts were created here, and the similarity between the usernames is incriminating. () 16:37, 24 July 2009 (UTC)

These two users appear to be the same, based on their edits. They both vandalized Bluegoblin7's userpage relating to his RFA. I would like to know if they are the same user and if there are anymore accounts. 16:37, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

Single purpose account. Started a discussion about a banned user, judging by the edits it could be the banned user they mentioned in the discussion. Just a hunch really. 01:33, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

Slooteht Kcab Nil Bogeul Bevig's only edit was to , in support of him. Even though the edit was in support of him, I believe that it could be Analysis Retentivus(Snow funn at tall), trying to cause disruption to his RFA. Since, he knows that new users votes generally do not count. I would like to know if it is Analysis Retentivus, and if there are anyother accounts. 16:43, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

The appearance of this user started out at commons involving a copyright violation with editors from here, and was then brought onto SWEP. Both of the accounts at commons and SWEP were created on the same day. Because of the behavior of this editor they were blocked for trolling, and it seems they may be a sockpuppet. I would like to know if there are anyother accounts. 16:39, 16 July 2009 (UTC)


Reason: Lot's on edits to the same types of pages and (frankly) just a hunch. 03:21, 11 July 2009 (UTC)


Reason: Blocked on en as "an apparent sock". So far, not caused any trouble here as of the time of this post, so consider this more of a notice than a CU request. I'll let some admin more familiar with this user decide what needs to be done. 03:29, 6 July 2009 (UTC)


Similar type of usernames; one engaging in personal attacks against and the other commenting on his TP. 11:04, 5 July 2009 (UTC)


Comppro request as one of his/her first edits sysop rights on simple and tried it on en, too. Later he tried to get the admin tools from meta (see and ) Well, it not the start with a comment/ vote on a RfA, but it is a RfA. Best () 17:57, 3 July 2009 (UTC)


The account vandalized Deskana's user page and my talk page back awhile. The IP vandalized my talk page today, and created an attack page(their talk page) back in April about Deskana at en.wp. I would like to know if the IP and account are the same user, and if there are anymore accounts. () 14:44, 29 June 2009 (UTC)


Contribution pattern looks very similar, especially RFA voting. Gut instinct. 20:47, 25 June 2009 (UTC)


I might be barking up the wrong tree here, but these usernames "are" identical after all. The former has been a good contributer so far, the second is blocked for just going on a mass vandal spree. Wanted to check by CU before causing any collateral damage, though have have removed PMDrive1061's rollback as a precautionary measure and left them a note. Thanks, 10:09, 24 June 2009 (UTC) 

Well, you know what they say: Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. :) Nope, that other doofus wasn't me. I was just alerted to this over at EN and I thought I'd weigh in for a laugh. Regards, the one and only () 00:15, 25 June 2009 (UTC)

...and many more until...

Log entries can be found here. This is indeed worrying if these users are used in a sock attack. Should blocking be made if confirmed as socks?


I believe these are all socks of the notorious vandal . They all fit his pattern of editing. In fact, he essentially admits it here: http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kremlinerr&diff=prev&oldid=1550135. () 14:44, 21 May 2009 (UTC)MKil


Our is indef-blocked at (SUL account list) for being a sock of a user (), also identified as , who is indef-blocked "here" () (SUL account list - and globally locked) for sock abuse. --""  04:52, 16 May 2009 (UTC)


Looking at the user's and the fact that all of them were made shortly after the account was created suggests that he could be back again to wreck havoc.     10:29, 6 May 2009 (UTC)


Reason: All three users have vandalized similar pages during the same times with the same kind of edits (i.e. change "pussycat" to "vaginacat"). Seems pretty obvious, but figured a CU can't hurt to confirm. 17:55, 5 May 2009 (UTC)

User's 2nd edit is to support CM16's unblock, and 1st edit is to post a picture of Jesus on his userpage. Evidence is just circumstancial, but I believe something is up. 01:03, 5 May 2009 (UTC)
