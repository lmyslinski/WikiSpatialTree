Anwar el Sadat

Muhammad Anwar el-Sadat (25 December 1918 – 6 October 1981) was the third President of Egypt. He served from 15 October 1970 until he was assassinated by Islamic extremists on 6 October 1981.

Sadat was born in 1918 into a family with 13 children, and attended a military school. After his graduation, he was sent to an outpost where he met and became a close friend of Gamal Abdel Nasser. There, the two of them became part of a group of young soldiers who later became the Free Officers group that overthrew the Muhammad Ali Dynasty in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. Nasser became the president after the revolution, and Sadat served as one of Nasser's ministers until he died in 1970.

Sadat was chosen as president because Nasser's supporters saw him as someone who they could control. They did not think he would be president for very long. However, in his eleven years as president Sadat changed a lot of the things Nasser had set in place, and made Egypt respected for its military strength and political power in the Middle East. On 6 October 1973, Sadat started the October War together with Syria, to try to take back the land Israel had taken from them six years earlier in the Six-Day War. The Egyptian army was very successful at the start of the war, and their advance across the Suez Canal into the Sinai Peninsula surprised Israel and the rest of the world. This success made Sadat a hero in Egypt, and for a time throughout the Arab World. 

Sadat visited Israel in 1977 and made a speech in front of the Knesset about what he thought was the best way to bring about peace with them. He was the first Arab leader to visit Israel and recognize that it was a country. In 1978, after the Camp David Accords, he signed a peace treaty with Israel. This won him the Nobel Peace Prize, but made him very unpopular among other Arabs who did not support peace with Israel. This led to Egypt being suspended from the Arab League at that time.

Many Islamists were very angry about the peace treaty. They made plans to take over the Egyptian government and kill all the main leaders, so that they could bring Egypt back to having an Islamic government instead of a secular one. In February 1981, the Egyptian government heard of this plan. In September that year, Sadat ordered over 1500 people arrested because he thought they might be part of the plot. These people included Islamists, but also the Bishop and other clergy, and many of Egypt's top intellectuals and activists. This arrest was very unpopular. However, Sadat missed a group of Islamists in the military who were led by Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli. This group assassinated Sadat on 6 October during the victory parade celebrating the crossing into the Sinai Peninsula. Eleven other people were killed in the attack, and 28 were wounded. At the same time, Islamists also took control of the city of Asyut for a few days.

Sadat's funeral was attended by many important people from around the world, including Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon, but only three Arab nations sent representatives, and only Sudan's head of state attended. Sadat was succeeded by his vice-president Hosni Mubarak.

100th Window

100th Window is the fourth studio album from the Bristol-based trip-hop group Massive Attack. Of the band's original core people, the album only features Robert Del Naja. Andrew Vowles left shortly after the release of "Mezzanine", and Grant Marshall did not want to be in the making of the record.

Released in February 2003, "100th Window" was written and produced by Del Naja and Neil Davidge, and features vocals from Horace Andy and Sinéad O'Connor, as well as one appearance by Damon Albarn. It is the first album by the band that made no use of samples, and contains none of the jazz or jazz fusion stylings of the Blue Lines or Protection recordings, but is less dark than Mezzanine. The album could have been released earlier, but Del Naja was arrested a few months earlier before it was released under suspicion of child pornography offences. However, he was clear.

Lude Check

Ludic Check (May 22, 1917 – May 11, 2009) was a professional hockey player who played for the Detroit Red Wings and the Chicago Black Hawks in the National Hockey League. After several years of hockey in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New York, Check was signed by the Montreal Canadiens after a season playing with the Quebec Senior Hockey League in 1943. In his first NHL season, he played only one professional game, with the Red Wings in 1944.

Check was then loaned to the Blackhawks, where he played 26 games in his final NHL season. The Canadiens then renewed his contract and sent him to the Ottawa "Senior" Senators of the Quebec Senior Hockey League, where he spent the last six seasons of his career. Check was a part of two Allan Cup-winning teams, in 1944 and 1949, and became a sales representative in later life. He died on May 11, 2009 in Ottawa, Ontario at the age of 91.

Check was born in Brandon, Manitoba on May 22, 1917. Alongside Frank Stahan, Check played two seasons from 1936 through 1938 with the Brandon Wheat Kings of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League. He played two seasons for the Regina Aces (later renamed the Regina Vic-Aces) of the Saskatchewan Senior Hockey League from 1938 through 1940 before deciding to continue his career at the professional level. At the peak of his career, Check stood five feet, ten inches tall and weighed 165 pounds.

After these teams Check, a left winger, spent a season with the New York Rovers of the Eastern Amateur Hockey League. Although the team finished last, he nevertheless was responsible for 21 goals and 20 assists. This was followed by a year with the Sydney Millionaires of the Cape Breton Senior Hockey League, producing 29 goals and 22 assists.

During the 1942–1943 season, Check was signed by the National Hockey League's Montreal Canadiens, although he continued to play for the Quebec Aces of the Quebec Senior Hockey League through 1944, scoring for them a total of 60 goals and 40 assists. His only NHL game during this period was played with the Detroit Red Wings on March 11, 1944, when the Canadiens provided him as an emergency injury replacement, and he did not score any points. Check did, however, win his first Allan Cup while playing with the Aces, defeating the Port Arthur Shipbuilders in 1944. For the 1944-1945 season, he was loaned to the Chicago Black Hawks, playing 26 games and scoring six goals and two assists.

Check spent the rest of his career with the Ottawa "Senior" Senators of the QSHL, after having his contract re-purchased by the Canadiens and being loaned out. He competed in the Allan Cup twice more. In 1948 his team lost to the Edmonton Eskimos, but captured the championship in 1949 after facing off against the Regina Pats. In six seasons with the Senators, he scored a total of 81 goals and 84 assists, placing him among the top ten league scorers four times. He retired after the 1950–1951 season.

After his hockey career, Check worked as a sales representative for the Hiram Walker distillery for over 30 years. Check died on May 11, 2009 at the age of 91 in Ottawa, Ontario. At the time of his death, he was one of the last surviving players from Ottawa's last Allan Cup championship team, the Senior Senators of 1949.

James Albert "Jimmy" Creighton (November 18, 1905 — May 29, 1990) was an ice hockey player and politician from Brandon, Manitoba.

Creighton played eleven games in the National Hockey League with the Detroit Falcons in 1931, scoring one goal and receiving one minor penalty. He was traded to the New York Americans in December 1931, but never played for the team. He later worked in the International Hockey League and the Can-Am Leagues. Creighton became a professional hockey referee after retiring as a player, and later worked as a general insurance salesman.

He served as an alderman in Brandon in 1946, 1948 and 1949, and was mayor of the city from 1952 to 1955 and from 1958 to 1961.

Creighton won the Liberal-Progressive nomination for Brandon City in the 1953 provincial election, defeating W.A. Wood and J.C. MacDonald at a contested meeting. He lost to Progressive Conservative candidate Reginald Lissaman in the general election, receiving 3,063 votes (40.13%) on the first count and losing on the second. Provincial elections in Manitoba were conducted by the single transferable ballot in this period.

Later in the same year, Creighton ran for the Canadian House of Commons in the 1953 federal election as a Liberal candidate in Brandon—Souris. He received 8,456 votes, and finished second to Progressive Conservative Walter Dinsdale. He ran for the Manitoba legislature a second time in the 1962, and lost to Lissaman again.

He suffered from Parkinson's Disease in his later years, and was eventually confined to a nursing home prior to his death in 1990.

Breccia

Breccia is a type of rock formed of broken fragments of minerals or rock cemented together by a fine-grained matrix. The matrix may be similar to or different from the composition of the fragments. 

Rocks formed by sticking together pieces of previous rocks (clasts) are called clastic rocks. There are two types of clastic rock: conglomerates and breccias. What divides these two categories is the amount of rounding. The particles that make up conglomerates are well rounded, whereas in breccias they are angular.

A breccia may have a variety of different origins, as indicated by the named types including sedimentary breccia, tectonic breccia, igneous breccia, impact breccia and hydrothermal breccia.

The basic sequence is as follows. Sediment is laid down in the sea, and is gradually transformed into sedimentary rock. After a long period of time something violent happens to the rock, breaking it up into many jagged pieces. Later the pieces are cemented together by another deposition, forming a new sedimentary rock. This is a breccia. On examination, the rock is seen to include fragments of the original rock.

Brecciated marble can have a marvellous appearance. The Pantheon in Rome is full of the most wonderful marble, many of which are breccias. It includes two gigantic columns of pavonazzetto, a breccia coming from Phrygia (in modern Turkey). Pavonazzetto obtains its name from its extremely colourful appearance, which is reminiscent of a peacock's feathers ("pavone" is "peacock" in Italian).

Potassium arsenate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula can be KAsO, KHAsO, or KHAsO. It has potassium and arsenate ions in it. 

Potassium arsenate is a white solid. It dissolves easily in water. It is an oxidizing agent. It is carcinogenic and highly toxic.

Potassium arsenate is made by reacting amounts of potassium hydroxide with arsenic acid. The amount of potassium hydroxide can be changed to make the different chemical formulas. Potassium arsenate was once used for medicine but is too toxic to be used now.

Clastic rock

Clastic rocks are composed of fragments, or clasts, of pre-existing rock.

Although, in principle, almost any rock made of eroded former rock is clastic (such as sandstone or mudstone), in practice the term is used for clasts of at least gravel size upwards. That means clasts are at least visible to the naked eye, and may be huge.

There are two types of clastic rock, by shape. conglomerates have rounded clasts, and breccias have jagged clasts.

In a clastic rock, the clasts are often of a different make-up from the ground rock or matrix

Spandau Prison

Spandau Prison was a prison situated in the borough of Spandau in the British Sector of West Berlin.

The prison was built in 1876 and knocked down in 1987 after the death of its last prisoner, Rudolf Hess. This was to stop it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine. The prison was near to the Renaissance-era Spandau Citadel fortress. 

The prison was built in 1876. At first it was only used for soldiers but after 1919 it was also used for civilian inmates. It held up to 600 inmates at that time.

In the aftermath of the Reichstag Fire of 1933, opponents of Hitler and journalists such as Egon Kisch and Carl von Ossietzky were held there in so-called protective custody. Spandau Prison became a sort of predecessor of the Nazi concentration camps. It was supposed to be controlled by the Prussian Ministry of Justice but the Gestapo tortured and abused its inmates, as Egon Erwin Kisch recalls in his memories of Spandau Prison. By the end of 1933 the first Nazi concentration camps had been built (at Dachau, Osthofen, Oranienburg, Sonnenburg, Lichtenburg and the marshland camps around Esterwegen). All remaining prisoners in "protective custody" in state prisons were transferred to these concentration camps.

After World War II it was operated by the Four-Power Authorities to house the Nazi war criminals sentenced to imprisonment at the Nuremberg Trials.

Only seven prisoners were finally imprisoned there. Arriving from Nuremberg on 18 July 1947, they were: 

Of the seven, only four served all of their sentence; the remaining three, Neurath, Raeder, and Funk, were released early due to ill health. Between 1966 and 1987, Rudolf Hess was the only inmate in Spandau Prison. His only companion was the warden, Eugene K. Bird, who became a close friend. Bird wrote a book about Hess's imprisonment entitled "The Loneliest Man in the World".

Spandau was one of only two Four-Power organizations to continue to operate after the breakdown of the Allied Control Council; the other being the Berlin Air Safety Center. The four occupying powers of Berlin would alternate control of the prison on a monthly basis, each having the responsibility for a total of three months out of the year.

The prison was demolished in 1987, largely to prevent it from becoming a Neo-Nazi shrine, after the death of its final remaining prisoner, Rudolf Hess, who had been the prison's sole occupant after the release of Speer and von Schirach in 1966. The site was made into a car park and a NAAFI shopping centre, named "The Britannia Centre Spandau" and nicknamed "Hessco's" after a British supermarket chain called "TESCO". All materials from the demolished prison were ground to powder and dumped in the North Sea or buried at the former RAF Gatow.

In 2006 a Kaiser's Supermarket, ALDI and a Media Markt consumer electronics store occupied the former prison grounds. In late 2008, Media Markt left the main shopping complex.

The prison, initially designed for a population in the hundreds, was an old brick building surrounded by one wall 15 feet high, another of 30 feet, a 10 foot high wall topped with electrified wire, followed by a wall of barbed wire. In addition, some of the sixty soldiers on guard duty manned nine machine-gun armed guard’s towers twenty-four hours a day. Due to the number of cells available, an empty cell was left between the prisoners' cells, to avoid the possibility of prisoners communicating in Morse Code. Other remaining cells in the wing were designated for other purposes, with one being used for the prison library and another for a chapel. The cells were approximately 3 metres long by 2.7 metres wide and 4 metres high.

The highlight of the prison, from the inmates' point of view, was the garden. The garden space was first divided into small personal plots that were used by each prisoner in many ways, usually for the growing of vegetables. Dönitz favored growing beans, Funk tomatoes, and Speer flowers, although the Soviet director subsequently banned flowers for a time. By regulation, all of the produce was to be put toward use in the prison kitchen, but prisoners and guards alike often skirted this rule and indulged in the garden's offerings. As prison regulations slackened and as prisoners became either apathetic or too ill to maintain their plots, the garden was consolidated into one large workable area. This suited the former architect Speer, who, being one of the youngest and liveliest of the inmates, later took up the task of refashioning the entire plot of land into a large complex garden, complete with paths, rock gardens, and flower displays. On days without access to the garden, for instance when it was raining, the prisoners occupied their time making envelopes together in the main corridor.

The Allied powers originally took over the prison in November 1946, expecting it to accommodate a hundred or more war criminals. Besides the sixty or so soldiers on duty in or around the prison at any given time, there were teams of professional civilian warders from each of the four countries, four prison directors and their deputies, four army medical officers, cooks, translators, waiters, porters and others. This was thought to be the wrong way to use the money and resources, and became a serious point of contention among the prison directors, politicians from their respective countries. The West Berlin government was especially unhappy at the arrangements because it cost them a lot of money but they still had a lack of space in their own prison system. 

Every part of life in the prison was strictly set out by a set of rules designed before the prisoners' arrival by the Four Powers — France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Compared with other established prison regulations at the time, Spandau's rules were quite strict.

The prisoners' outgoing letters to families were at first limited to one page every month;
A lot of the stricter regulations were either later relaxed, or deliberately ignored by prison staff. The directors and guards of the Western powers (France, Britain, and the United States), often complained about many of the stricter measures. The complaints were often vetoed by the Soviet Union, because it thought the rules should be stricter. The Soviet Union suffered 19 million civilian deaths during the war, and wanted the death penalty for all of the prisoners at the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg. Western commentators accused the Russians of keeping Spandau prison in operation chiefly as a centre for Soviet spying, as they had an excuse to drive into western Berlin, and the soldiers often looked out over the city instead of into the prison grounds.

Every day, prisoners had to wake up at 06:00 hours, wash, clean their cells and the corridor together, eat breakfast. They then stayed in the garden until lunch-time at noon (weather permitting), after lunch they rested in their cells, then returned to the garden. Supper followed at 17:00 hours, after which the prisoners were returned to their cells. Lights out was at 22:00 hours. Prisoners were given a shave and a haircut, if necessary, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday; they did their own laundry every Monday. This routine, except the time allowed in the garden, changed very little throughout the years, although each of the controlling nations made their own interpretation of the prison regulations.

All prisoners feared the months when the Soviets were in control; the Russians were much stricter in enforcing prison regulations and offered poorer quality meals. Each nation in charge would bring its own cook and, in the American, French, and British months, feed the prisoners better than regulations allowed. The Soviets would offer an unchanging diet of coffee, bread, soup, and potatoes. This rigidity was primarily due to the much-loathed Soviet director, who perpetually enforced these measures and whom Russian and Western guards alike feared and despised. Until this director's sudden removal in the early 1960s, the 'Soviet month' was dreaded. Afterwards, matters, including diet, were improved.

Conglomerate (geology)

A conglomerate is a rock consisting of individual clasts within a finer-grained matrix that have become cemented together. 

Conglomerates are sedimentary rocks consisting of rounded fragments and are thus differentiated from breccias, which consist of angular clasts. Both conglomerates and breccias have clasts larger than sand (>2 mm).

Philip, Duke of Parma

Philip of Spain (15 March 1720 – 18 July 1765) was Duke of Parma from 1748 to 1765. He founded the Parma line of the House of Bourbon. He was a son in law of Louis XV. 

Born at the Royal Alcazar in Madrid, he was the fourth child and third son of Philip V of Spain and his wife, Elisabeth Farnese. He was raised in Madrid and as a child showed more interest in art than in politics. He was created Count of Chinchón, which he later ceded to his brother Louis in 1754.

His mother was the last of the Farnese, rulers the Duchy of Parma. The Duchy had been ruled between 1731 and 1736 by his elder brother Charles I, but exchanged with Austria for The Two Sicilies after the War of Polish Succession. Twelve years later, in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748), Austria lost Parma, and Philip became the new Duke, founding the Bourbons of Parma.

As part of the Treaty of Versailles (1757) between Austria and France it was intended that Philip would become King of the Southern Netherlands, in a deal that would see French troops occupy key positions in the country – however this arrangement was repudiated by the subsequent Third Treaty of Versailles and Philip continued in Parma.

Parma was ruined by many years of warfare, and in 1759 Philip named the abled Frenchmen Guillaume du Tillot as his minister to restore the economy. He stimulated education and philosophy, attracting personalities like Étienne Bonnot de Condillac.

Philip died unexpectedly on 18 July 1765 in Alessandria, Italy, after having accompanied his daughter Maria Luisa on her way to Genoa, where she sailed for Spain to marry Infante Charles. Through Philip's daughter Maria Luisa, he is an ancestor of the Bourbons of Spain, the Bourbons of the Two Sicilies, and the House of Orléans.

Philip married Louise Élisabeth of France in Alcalá de Henares, Spain on 25 October 1739. She was the eldest daughter of Louis XV. They had three children. The marriage was the first between the French and Spanish Bourbons, the other taking place in 1745 between Louis, Dauphin of France and Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain.

Jacques Cousteau

Jacques-Yves Cousteau known as Jacques Cousteau (born 11 June 1910; died in 25 June 1997) was a French naval officer, explorer, ecologist, filmmaker, innovator, scientist, photographer, author and researcher who studied the sea and all forms of life in water. He helped create the aqua-lung, helped marine conservation and was a member of the Académie française. He was also known as "le Commandant Cousteau" or "Captain Cousteau".

Cousteau was born on 11 June 1910, in Saint-André-de-Cubzac, Gironde, to Daniel and Élisabeth Cousteau. He had one brother, Pierre-Antoine. Cousteau attended Collège Stanislas in Paris. In 1930, he entered the École Navale and graduated as a gunnery officer. After an automobile accident cut short his career in naval aviation, Cousteau changed to studying the sea.

In Toulon, where he was serving on the "Condorcet", Cousteau carried out his first underwater experiments, thanks to his friend Philippe Tailliez who in 1936 lent him some Fernez underwater goggles. Cousteau also belonged to the information service of the French Navy, and was sent on missions to Shanghai and Japan (1935–1938) and in the USSR (1939).

On 12 July 1937 he married Simone Melchior, with whom he had two sons, Jean-Michel (born 1938) and Philippe (1940–1979). His sons took part in the adventures of the "Calypso". In 1991, one year after his wife Simone's death from cancer, he married Francine Triplet. They already had a daughter Diane Cousteau (born 1980) and a son Pierre-Yves Cousteau (born 1982), born during Cousteau's marriage to his first wife.

Jacques-Yves Cousteau died on 25 June 1997 in Paris, aged 87. Despite rumors, encouraged by some Islamic publications and websites, Cousteau did not convert to Islam, and when he died he was buried in a Roman Catholic Christian funeral. He was buried in the family vault at Saint-André-de-Cubzac in France. A street was named "rue du Commandant Cousteau" in a street which runs near his native house, where a commemorative plaque was affixed.

During his lifetime, Jacques-Yves Cousteau received these awards:

Creative destruction

Creative destruction (German: "schöpferische Zerstörung") is a term that came from Marxism. It talks about how wealth is gathered and lost under capitalism. The term was first used in Werner Sombart's "Krieg und Kapitalismus" ("War and Capitalism", 1913) These ideas were first discussed in books "The Communist Manifesto" (1848), in "Grundrisse" (1857) "Volume IV" of "Das Kapital" (1863).

Creative destruction is supposed to describe a theory of how the "destruction" of economic order leads to capitalistic economic ideals. A German Marxist sociologist (Sombart) is credited for using it first in his 1913 book "Krieg und Kapitalismus", which means "War and Capitalism" in English. The works and publications of Marxists such as Karl Marx himself, and Friedrich Engels, a socialist scientist, discuss the ideas of creative destruction.

In and after the 1950s, the term became associated with Austrian-American economist Joseph Schumpeter. Schumpeter is credited for making the theory popular. However, his idea of creative destruction was quite different from Marx's original theory. The term gained popularity within neoliberal or free-market economics where it is used to described processes such as downsizing. The original Marxist usage has, however, been maintained in the work of influential social scientists such as David Harvey, Marshall Berman, and Manuel Castells.

Muslim Brotherhood

The Society of the Muslim Brothers, often called the Muslim Brotherhood, or The Brotherhood, is an Islamist movement. Today, it exists in many states and often is one of the largest political opposition groups. The group is the world's oldest and largest Islamic political group, and the "world's most influential Islamist movement". Hassan al-Banna founded the group in Egypt in 1928. 

The Brotherhood's stated goal is to instill the Qur'an and Sunnah as the "sole reference point for ... ordering the life of the Muslim family, individual, community ... and state". Since it was created, in 1928 the movement has officially opposed violent means to achieve its goals, with some exceptions such as in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or to overthrow secular Ba'athist rule in Syria (see Hama massacre). This position has been questioned, particularly by the Egyptian government, which accused the group of a campaign of killings in Egypt after World War II.

The Muslim Brotherhood is banned in Egypt. People have been arrested because they participated in the group. To circumvent this ban, supporters of the group often run for office as independent candidates.

Outside Egypt, the group's political activity is more traditional and conservative. Inside Egypt, the group is modernist and wants reforms to happen. 
In Kuwait,for example, the Muslim Brotherhood says that women should not have a right to vote in elections. The Brotherhood condemned terrorism and the 9/11 attacks. Whether the group has ties to terrorist organisations is disputed. 

The question whether and how to use violence has also led to disputes inside the movement. At times, those in favour of using violence split from the main group and created their own groups. Examples of such groups are Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (The Islamic Group) and Al Takfir Wal Hijra (Excommunication and Migration).

Among the Brotherhood's more influential members was Sayyid Qutb. Qutb was the author of one of Islamism's most important books, "Milestones". The book called for the restoration of Islam by re-establishing the Sharia and by using "physical power and Jihad for abolishing the organizations and authorities of the Jahili system. Qutb believed these included the entire Muslim world. The book also reveals that Qutb no longer held the Brotherhood's ideas and that he was closer to the ideas of Hizb ut-Tahrir, which is concluded in the introduction and dedication of the book" While studying at university, Osama bin Laden claimed to have been influenced by the religious and political ideas of several professors with strong ties to the Muslim Brotherhood including both Sayyid Qutb and his brother Muhammad Qutb. However, once Al Qaeda was fully organized, they denounced the Muslim Brotherhood's reform through nonviolence and accused them of "betraying the cause of Islam and abandoning their 'jihad' in favour of forming political parties and supporting modern state institutions".

The Brotherhood is financed by contributions from its members, who are required to allocate a part of their income to the movement. Some of these contributions are from members who live in oil-rich countries.

Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), originally called al-Jihad, is an Egyptian terrorist group based on an extreme interpretation of Islam. It has been active since the late 1970s. It is under worldwide embargo by the United Nations as a group linked to al-Qaeda. It is also banned by several governments around the world, including that of the Russian Federation. 

Since 1991 it has been led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is now the deputy leader of al-Qaeda. According to Zawahiri, the EIJ was "different from the Takfir wal Hijra group as we do not consider people infidels because of their sins. And we are different from the Muslim Brotherhood because sometimes they do not oppose the government".

The organization's original main goal was to overthrow the Egyptian government and replace it with an Islamic state based on the way it thought Islam should be. Later it broadened its aims to include attacking the United States and Israel, and other interests in Egypt and abroad.

Islamic Jihad was responsible for the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981. Sadat's Sinai treaty with Israel, which recognized the Jewish state, made them very angry.

In June 2001, Al Qaeda and Egyptian Islamic Jihad, which had been associated with each other for many years, merged into 'Qaeda al-Jihad'.

No Protection is the name of a dub remix of Massive Attack's second album "Protection". The remix was done by the British dub producer Mad Professor. Mad Professor was contacted by Massive Attack after "Protection" was released to remix a song for a single. After the single was remixed, the band asked Mad Professor to listen to more of the album to find the possibility of more remixes. The project then became a track by track remix of almost the entire album. Mad Professor heavily edited the original material to form a slow, pulsating mix in which the beat is emphasized, reverb is extensively used and the occasional vocals (many of the tracks are almost entirely instrumental) fade in-and-out in normal dub fashion, making a hypnotic, if slightly repetitive, mix. The result is, on paper, more textured than the original, but loses any sense of the jazzy feel of "Protection."

Cadmium sulfide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CdS. It has cadmium and sulfide ions in it.

Cadmium sulfide is a yellow orange solid. It does not dissolve in water. It reacts with hydrochloric acid to make hydrogen sulfide and cadmium chloride. It is used in an odd reaction where cadmium sulfide is sprinkled into a sulfide solution and light is shined on it. It starts making small amounts of hydrogen gas. 

Cadmium sulfide is only found in two rare minerals. It is normally made artificially.

Cadmium sulfide is made several different ways. Cadmium salts, normally the sulfate or the chloride (cadmium chloride), are reacted with hydrogen sulfide to make a bright yellow cadmium sulfide solid. When it is made for pigment, the cadmium sulfide is then washed, heated (to change it into the right form), and ground to a powder. It is then mixed with paint.

Cadmium sulfide is used as a yellow pigment. Cadmium yellow is the name of the pigment. If selenide is added during the roasting process (seen above in "preparation" section), it can make an orange or a yellow pigment. Cadmium sulfide is a good pigment because it does not break down easily, is very bright, and does not react with air like other pigments can. It is toxic, though. 

It is also used in photoresistors that are sensitive to infrared and red light. Cadmium sulfide is found around some bacteria that reduce sulfate to sulfide.

<doc id="276372" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=276372" title="Confuciusornis">
Confuciusornis

Confuciusornis is a genus of primitive crow-sized birds from the Lower Cretaceous. It was found in the Yixian and Jiufotang Formations of China, dating from 125 to 120 million years ago. The bird was named after the Chinese moral philosopher Confucius (551–479 BC).

Like modern birds, "Confuciusornis" had a toothless beak, but close relatives of modern birds such as "Hesperornis" and "Ichthyornis" were toothed. This shows that the loss of teeth occurred more than once, in "Confuciusornis" and in ancestors of modern birds. This is an example of convergent evolution.

"Confuciusornis" is the oldest known bird to have a beak. It is also the first known bird to have lost the long tail of "Archaeopteryx" and develop fused tail vertebrae (a pygostyle).

"Confuciusornis" is one of the most abundant vertebrates found in the Yixian Formation, and "several hundred" complete, articulated specimens have been found.

The proportions of the toes suggest that they were used for both walking and perching, while the large claws of the thumb and third finger were probably used for climbing. The head probably had a small crest or tuft.

The orientation of the shoulder joint was sideways, instead of angled upward as in modern birds; this means that "Confuciusornis" was unable to lift its wings above its back. Like "Archaeopteryx", it was thus incapable of the upstroke required for flapping flight. This conclusion is not established at present. Peters sees "Confuciusornis" as capable of flapping flight but specialising in soaring flight. The bird's weight has also been debated. 

An argument from Gregory Paul noted that "Confuciusornis" is commonly found as large groups in lake bottom sediments with little to no evidence of the bodies being moved after death. It would be highly unusual for gliding animals to be found in such large numbers in deep water. Rather, this evidence suggests that "Confuciusornis" traveled in large flocks over the lake surfaces, a habitat consistent with a flying animal.

In early 2010, a group of scientists led by Zhang Fucheng examined fossils with preserved melanosomes (organelles which contain colour pigments). By studying the fossils with an electron microscope, they found melanosomes preserved in a fossil "Confuciusornis" specimen.

The Communist Manifesto

The Manifesto of the Communist Party (German: "Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei"), more commonly known as The Communist Manifesto, is a short book. It was written by the German Marxist political theorists Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in 1848. The book was originally written in the German language. Since it was first published, it became one of the world's most influential and controvesial political manuscripts, and has been translated into many languages. The book is about analyzing approaches to class struggles (from both the past and present), and problems with capitalism. 

The book does not talk about or predict how communism would be in the future. It is a mixture of both Marx and Engels' theories and opinions on society and politics. It also has their written ideas of how the capitalist society of their time would be replaced by socialism, and after that, communism.

All articles need references and sources, but it's most important to make sure that articles that are about living people do. If an article says something about somebody that is not true and that is harmful, they could sue Wikipedia, or make Wikipedia look very bad. Many people read Wikipedia, and having false information about somebody can be very harmful to them.

English Wikipedia has been taking some time recently to make sure that all articles about living people have good references, and it would be a good idea for us to do so, too. If you see something in an article, especially about a living person, that you're not sure is true, or just doesn't look right, it's better to remove something that is true than it is to leave something in that is false.

Sultanate of Nugaal

The Sultanate of Nugaal was a Somali territory that existed semi-officially from 1905 to 1911.

On Mar 3,1905 the "Mad Mullah" declared himself "Mahdi" of Nogal (other name of the Nugaal valley) in northern Italian Somalia, while the "sultan" was Sayid Maxamad Cabdille Xasan. The territory coincided approximately with the actual Nugaal area in northeastern Somalia. It was ruled like a kind of sultanate in behalf of the Mahdi. 

His rule was terminated by Italy in 1911. The Italian victory started on September 3, 1908 when Italian official Di Giorgio conquered Afgoi and the sultan of Ghelédi with his 5000 men surrendered to the Italians (who won an important battle at Araré and Eyl).
Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (nicknamed the "the Mad Mullah" by the British) escaped to British Somaliland, where later died in 1920.

During 1910-1914, Sayyid's capital moved from Illig to Taleex in the heart of Nugaal where he built three garrison forts of massive stone work and a number of houses. He built a "luxurious" palace for himself and kept new guards drawn from outcast clans. By 1913, he had dominated the entire hinterland of the Somali peninsula by building forts at Jildali and Mirashi in Warsangali country, at Werder and Qorahy in the Ogaden and Beledweyne in southern Somalia. 

After the collapse of Muhammad Abdullah Hassan’s resistance movement, rebellion and revolt occurred with disputes between different tribes in Northern Somalia. 

The Italian government of Somalia again worked together with the old tribesmen in order to try and keep peace between the several tribes, while maintaining close control over the military.

Lower East Side

The Lower East Side is a neighborhood in southeastern part of the New York City borough of Manhattan. The neighborhood is roughly made up of Allen Street, East Houston Street, Essex Street, Canal Street, Eldridge Street, East Broadway, and Grand Street. It is considered to be an immigrant, working class area, but some parts of the neighborhood have been bought, repaired, destroyed, and renovated in recent years. Because of this, The National Trust for Historic Preservation put Lower East Side Manhattan on their list of America's Most Endangered Places At one time, much of the Lower East Side was tenements or slums, but many of these have been torn down or replaced by housing projects. During the late 19th and early 20th century, almost a million people lived on the Lower East Side, making it one of the most densely populated places on the planet. In the early to mid-19th century, many of the people were from Ireland and Germany. In the late 19th and early 20th century, many of the people there were from Eastern Europe, including many Jews. Today, many of the immigrants in the Lower East Side are from the Dominican Republic and China.

Hugues Cuénod

Hugues-Adhémar Cuénod (born 26 June 1902; died 6 December 2010) was a Swiss opera singer. He was a tenor. He was particularly famous for singing comic roles in opera. He had an extremely long career, lasting over 65 years. He was still singing in opera at the age of 92. He died at the age of 108.

Hugues Cuénod was born in Coiseaux-sur-Vevey. Cuénod he studied at the Ribaupierre Institute in Lausanne, at the conservatories in Geneva and Basel, and in Vienna. At first he sang in concerts. Then, in 1928, he got a part in the jazz opera "Jonny spielt auf" by Ernst Krenek when it was performed in Paris. The next year he sang for the first time in the United States in Noël Coward's "Bitter Swee t". He worked in Geneva until 1933, then he went to Paris where he met the music teacher Nadia Boulanger. She had a big influence on his musical development. He made a concert tour of North America. From 1940 to 1946 he taught at the Geneva Conservatory. In 1943 he started singing in opera again, singing in Johann Strauss II's "Die Fledermaus" in Geneva. Then he sang at Milan's La Scala (1951), the Glyndebourne Festival (from 1954 on) and London's Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (1954, 1956 and 1958).

Cuénod sang music by many different composers. He was famous for singing the part of Basilio in Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro", the Astrologer in Rimsky-Korsakov's "The Golden Cockerel", and Sellem in Stravinsky's "The Rake's Progress".

Citadel

A citadel is a large fortress mainly used to protect towns or castles from attacks or disaster, though citadels have been built for other reasons as well. The oldest known citadels were built in the Indus Valley Civilization, where the citadel may have been used as a symbol of authority, no one is fully sure about their purpose. 

In Ancient Greece, the Acropolis was important in the life of the people, serving as a refuge and stronghold in peril and containing military and food supplies, the shrine of the god and a royal palace. The most well-known is the Acropolis of Athens, but nearly every Greek city-state had one - the Acrocorinth famed as a particularly strong fortress. 

The "Citadelle" of Quebec still survives as the largest citadel still in official military operation in North America after more than two hundred years of existence.

<doc id="276610" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=276610" title="Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau">
Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau

Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (born 28 May 1925 in Berlin) is a German baritone singer. He is now retired, but for more than 30 years he was thought of by many as the greatest male singer in classical music. He was particularly famous for his singing of Lieder (German art songs), but he was also a superbly great singer of opera as well as a concert singer with orchestras. Later in his career he also conducted.

Fischer-Dieskau had a lyrical baritone voice, not a powerful, heroic voice like a Heldentenor. In spite of that he recorded many operatic roles which are traditionally thought of as being for Heldentenor: Wotan in Richard Wagner's Ring Cycle, Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Amfortas in Parsifal, Macbeth in Verdi's opera etc. 

He is the most recorded singer of all time.. He sang in many languages as well as German: French, Russian, Hebrew and Hungarian. 

Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau was born in Berlin. His parents were teachers. He started singing as a child and began voice lessons at the age of 16. He had to join the German army (the Wehrmacht) during World War II, in 1943. He had only just finished school. He was captured in Italy in 1945 and spent two years as an American prisoner of war. During that time, he sang Lieder in POW camps to homesick German soldiers.

In 1947 he returned to Germany where he started his professional career singing the baritone solo in Brahms' "Ein Deutsches Requiem" without any rehearsal. (He was a last-minute substitute for a singer who was ill.) He gave his first Lieder recital in Leipzig later that year.

From early in his career he worked with famous lyric sopranos Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Irmgard Seefried, and the recording producer Walter Legge, producing very popular albums of lieder by Franz Schubert and Hugo Wolf.

In the autumn of 1948, Fischer-Dieskau became principal lyric baritone at the Städtische Oper Berlin (Municipal Opera, West Berlin), making his first opera performance in the role of Posa in Verdi's "Don Carlos" under the conductor Ferenc Fricsay. This company, known after 1961 as the Deutsche Oper, was to be his artistic home until his retirement from the operatic stage, in 1978.

Fischer-Dieskau made guest appearances at the opera houses in Vienna and Munich. After 1949 he made concert tours in the Netherlands, Switzerland, France and Italy. In 1951, he first appeared at a concert in the Salzburg Festival with Mahler's "Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen (Songs of a Wayfarer)" under Wilhelm Furtwängler. He was starting to appear all over the world: in the Royal Albert Hall, London, Boston, Massachusetts and at the Bayreuth Festival.

As an opera singer, Fischer-Dieskau performed mainly in Berlin and at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. He also made guest appearances at the Vienna State Opera, at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London, at the Hamburg State Opera, in Japan, and at the King's Theatre in Edinburgh, during the Edinburgh Festival. His first tour in the United States took place in 1955, when he was 29. For his recitals there he was accompanied by Gerald Moore. He recorded many Lieder with Gerald Moore, and gave many recitals with him until Moore retired in 1967. However, they continued to make recordings after that. Their recordings of the Schubert song cycles
"Die schöne Müllerin" and "Die Winterreise" were very highly thought of.

Fischer-Dieskau also performed many works by living composers including Benjamin Britten, Samuel Barber, Hans Werner Henze, Karl Amadeus Hartmann, Ernst Krenek and Witold Lutosławski.

Fischer-Dieskau also recorded many famous roles in Italian operas, e.g. Verdi's Rigoletto and Rodrigo in Verdi's "Don Carlos", Scarpia in Giacomo Puccini's "Tosca". He retired from opera in 1978.

Fischer-Dieskau's musicianship and technique were always perfect. He retired from the concert hall on New Year's Day, 1993, at 67, and spent his time conducting, teaching (especially the interpretation of Lieder), painting and writing books. 

In 1949, Fischer-Dieskau married the cellist Irmgard Poppen. Together they had three sons: Mathias, who became a stage designer,Martin (a conductor), and Manuel (a cellist). Irmgard died in 1963 of complications following childbirth. Afterwards, Fischer-Dieskau was married to the actress Ruth Leuwerik, from 1965 to 1967, and Christina Pugel-Schule, from 1968 to 1975. Since 1977 he has been married to the soprano Julia Varady.

Banyan

A banyan (or 'banian') is a kind of fig. It begins to grow on another plant.

Its seeds germinate in the cracks and crevices on a host tree, or on structures like buildings and bridges. 

"Banyan" often means the Indian Banyan or "Ficus benghalensis", the National tree of India. The term actually includes all figs which share their epiphytic life cycle. They are put in the subgenus Urostigma. The seeds of banyans are dispersed by fruit-eating birds. The seeds germinate and send down roots towards the ground. These roots may envelop (cover) part of the host tree or building structure, when they get the casual name of strangler fig. 

A number of tropical forest species grow by strangling. A good example is the genus "Ficus" that competes for light. Any "Ficus" species showing this habit may be termed a strangler fig.

The leaves of Banyan tree are large, leathery, glossy green and elliptical in shape. Like most of the fig-trees, the leaf bud is covered by two large scales. As the leaf develops the scales fall. Young leaves have an attractive reddish tinge.

Older banyan trees have aerial prop roots that grow into thick woody trunks which, with age, can become indistinguishable from the main trunk. Old trees can spread out laterally using these prop roots to cover a wide area.
Like other Fig species (which includes the common edible fig "Ficus carica"), banyans have unique fruit structures and are dependent on fig wasps for reproduction.

Once the roots get to the ground, they suck up nutrients and grow faster and thicker.
They cover the trunk of the host tree, and their leaves and branches in the canopy block the light from the host. Lacking enough nutrition and light, the host tree eventually dies. Its wood is destroyed by beetles, termites and fungi. Only the hollow space inside the banyan remains. The banyan roots make a huge cylinder, and it stands up perfectly well. 

Often the banyan tree is formed from several different fruits which germinated on the same host tree. This has been proved by genetic analysis.

The Royal House of Hohenzollern began ruling the area around Berlin and Brandenburg in modern Germany in 1415.

They became one of the Electors of the Holy Roman Emperor, Kings of Prussia in 1702 and in 1871 German Emperors. 

They stopped ruling after World War One, when Germany became a republic. Prussia was abolished by the 4 allied powers controlling Germany in 1947.

The Royal Family took their name from their ancestral home Hohenzollern Castle in what is now Baden-Württemberg. The area around the castle was once ruled as a separate principality.

Hohenzollern-Hechingen

Hohenzollern-Hechingen was a county and principality in southwestern Germany, part of what is now Baden-Württemberg. Its rulers were members of a branch of the senior Swabian branch of the Hohenzollern family.

The County of Hohenzollern-Hechingen was created in 1576, when the County of Hohenzollern was divided. The county was ruled as a part of the Holy Roman Empire. When the last count of Hohenzollern, Charles I of Hohenzollern (1512–1579) died, the territory was to be divided up between his three sons:

Unlike the Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg and Prussia, the Hohenzollerns of southwest Germany remained Roman Catholic. The County was raised to a principality in 1623.

The principality joined the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 and was a member state of the German Confederation between 1815 and 1850. The democratic Revolution of 1848 was relatively successful in Hohenzollern, and on 16 May 1848, the Prince was forced to accept the constitution limiting his power. However, the conflict between monarch and democrats continued, and on 6 August, Hohenzollern was occupied by Prussian forces. On 7 December, 1849, Prince Friedrich Wilhelm Konstantin sold the country to his relative, King Frederick William IV of Prussia. On 12 March 1850, Hohenzollern-Hechingen officially became part of Prussia. Hohenzollern-Hechingen and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, which also became part of Prussia in 1850, were called the Hohenzollernsche Lande .

Government of Hamburg

The government of Hamburg is divided into executive, legislative and judicial branches.

There are two levels of government. 

As a federal state the city wide administration has much more responsibility and scope than in ordinary cities.

The head of the city-wide and state administration is the First Mayor ("Erster Bürgermeister"). A ministry is called "Behörde" (office) and a state minister is a "Senator" in Hamburg. 

The legislature is the state parliament, called "Hamburgische Bürgerschaft".

The judicial branch is composed of the state supreme court and other courts. 

The seat of the government is Hamburg Rathaus.

There is a clear separation of powers.

The power to create, amend and ratify laws (legislature) is given to the parliament. A plebiscite and a referendum is possible due to the Constitution of Hamburg. In other German states the parliament is called "Landtag".

The parliament is among other things responsible for the law, the election of the "Erster Bürgermeister" (First Mayor) for the election period and the control of the Senate (cabinet). The parliament is a unicameral parliament (only has one chamber) and the 121 deputies are elected in universal, direct, free, equal and secret elections every four years.

The executive is the "Senat der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg" (Senate of Hamburg or cabinet). Its purpose is to enforce the laws. The senate is responsible for the day-to-day management and head of this branch is the First Mayor. The senate represents Hamburg to the federal government and other states or countries.

The "Senat der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg" is formed by the First Mayor of Hamburg, the Minister President and mayor of Hamburg. His deputy is the Second Mayor. The senate is permitted no more than 12 members by law. This law also regulates among other, pay, pensions, privilege to refuse to give evidence and the legal position of Hamburg judges. The senators get appointed by the First Mayor and thereafter they need to get confirmed by the Hamburg Parliament. The First Mayor forms the ministries, according to the coalition agreement of the ruling parties.

Until 1860 the government of Hamburg was called "Rath" or "Rat" (board/council), the members had been "Ratsherrn" (aldermen) and "Bürgermeister" (Burgomaster). After a change of the Constitution of Hamburg in 1861 the government was called "Hamburger Senat".

Prior to the first world war the two mayors were elected for one-year-terms. Until 1997 the First Mayor was Primus inter pares among his colleagues in the Senate, by whom he was elected. Since then, he has been elected by the parliament and been able appoint and to dismiss other Senators.

Interpreting the law (Judiciary) is task of the "Hamburgisches Verfassungsgericht" (Constitutional Court of Hamburg) and 17 more courts of Hamburg.

The supreme court has a president and 8 judges. The City Parliament elects the judges for 6 years and they only canget reelected once. The schedule of responsibilities is based on the constitution of Hamburg (Art. 65) and the "Gesetzes über das Hamburgische Verfassungsgericht" (Law of the Constitutional Court of Hamburg) (§ 14).

The professional judges of the other courts are appointed by the senate according to a nomination of a committee.

In 2011, there are nine senators holding ministerial positions and the head of state, the First mayor. A senator is the presiding minister for a "Behörde" (translated: 'government agency' meaning here is more ministry).

The State Chancellery () coordinates the senate and supports the mayor. The First Mayor is head in this agency. In 2011, the First Mayor of Hamburg is Olaf Scholz.

The ministry () is responsible for the school system in Hamburg.


Among others the is the oversight authority for the law enforcement agencies in Hamburg, the fire brigade, for disaster control and its units, the residents registration offices, the State Election Office and the Scientology Task Force (). In 2011, Michael Neumann (SDP) is the Minister of the Interior.


In 2011, head of the Ministry of Finance is Peter Tschenscher (CDU).


In 2011, Frank Horch (Independent) is head of the minitry.


The ministry () is in charge of the correctional facilities, the courts and the revision of the laws. In 2011, Jana Schiedek (SPD) is the Minister of Justice of Hamburg. 


On May 7, 2008 the former Ministry of Culture was changed to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Media (), now among other responsible for tourism, the public record office of Hamburg, the office of the protection of historical monuments and the memorial site for the Neuengamme concentration camp. In 2005 the annual budget was €212.7 million.

Since law enforcement and police duties are partly in the responsibility of the German states, Hamburg has its own police force. This forces consists of the state police " Polizei Hamburg", the State Criminal Police Office (German: "Landeskriminalamt"), the Criminal Investigation Services ("Kriminalpolizei"), the Water Police ("Wasserschutzpolizei") controlling traffic in the port of Hamburg, the Reserve Police ("Bereitschaftspolizei"), the Special Weapons and Tactics Unit ("Spezialeinsatzkommando") and Mobile Surveillance Units ("Mobiles Einsatzkommando"). 

The State Office for the Protection of the Constitution ("Landesamt für den Verfassungsschutz") is Hamburg's domestic intelligence agency. 

The Ministry of the Interior has the legal and technical oversight for the law enforcement agencies.

Elections for the state parliament of Hamburg are held every four years, combined with the elections of the diet of the boroughs ("Bezirksversammlungen"). The elections are regulated by law.

Main political parties in Hamburg are the Christian Democratic Union, the Social Democratic Party, Alliance '90/The Greens, The Left and as of 2008 not in the state parliament the Free Democratic Party.

The STATT party is a minor political party, which was founded in 1993. The party was elected to the Hamburg Parliament in the Hamburg state election, 1993. The governing SPD and the new STATT party formed a coalition to rule until 1997, when the party lost all seats.

A defunct party is Law and Order Offensive Party (Partei Rechtsstaatlicher Offensive - Offensive D). The party was in the Hamburg Parliament from 2001 until 2004, receiving 19.4% of votes.
The highest honour given by the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg is the honorary citizenship ("Ehrenbürgerrecht"). It is given by the senate, if the parliament confirmed the motion of the senate. The honorary citizenship is comparable to the honour Freedom of the City.

The "Golden Book" consists of the signatures of especially honoured guests of Hamburg. The book itself is a box with not fixed sheets. It is folded in golden leather and a gift of the family of the First Mayor Carl Friedrich Petersen (1809 – 1892). In 1937 the German leader Adolf Hitler signed the book before giving a public speech in Hamburg. During the denazification Hitler's sheet, as these from other Nazis, was removed from the book. The only signature remained is from Joseph Goebbels, because he wrote on the same sheet as the former German President Paul von Hindenburg. The Dalai Lama signed the Golden Book during his 5th visit in Hamburg in February 2007.
|-
Hamburg citizens were not allowed to receive decorations — only medals or medallions. This act was first enlawed for members of the senate and Hamburg's judges, later the act was false legally extended for all citizens by the Senate of Hamburg. The act originated from the Hamburg city law of the 13th century. One of the few "Hanseaten" – citizens of a Hanseatic city – who received decoration was Alwin Münchmeyer, an entrepreneur. Münchmeyer stated later, that this were his "falls of mankind". Even Helmut Schmidt — former Hamburg Senator of the Interior and German chancellor — declined several times to be awarded with the Federal Cross of Merit, stating he had been a Hamburg senator and according to the Hanseatic tradition not allowed to wear decorations.

In 1843 the Hamburg fire medal was awarded to the volunteers, who came to help during the great fire from 5 May until 8 May 1842. In total 4858 medals were awarded from the grateful Hamburg in distress to its friends, as the inscription states "Das Dankbare Hamburg Seinen Freunden In Der Noth".

During World War I (1914 – 1918) the Hanseatic Cross (German: "Hanseatenkreuz") was a decoration of the three Hanseatic Cities of Bremen, Hamburg and Lübeck, who were member states of the German Empire. Each city-state established its own version of the cross, but the design and award criteria were similar for each. There were approximately 50,000 awards of the Hanseatic Cross of Hamburg.

In 2007 the "Herbert Weichmann medallion" – named for the First Mayor Herbert Weichmann (in office 1965 – 1971) – was granted for the first time by the city of Hamburg, honoring "those - both Jewish and non-Jewish - who have contributed to Jewish life in Germany". First recipients were Paul Spiegel (posthumous), who was a member of the executive committee of the "Zentralrat der Juden", and Hinrich Reemtsma, whose foundation constributed €500,000 for the removal of the Jewish community centre in Hamburg.

Carlos Andrés Pérez

Carlos Andrés Pérez was the former president of Venezuela. He was born in 1922, served twice as president in the late 1900s, and died in 2010.

Pérez was born on 22 October 1922 in Rubio, Venezuala. He went to school in Caracas, where he studied law. In 1948, he married Blanca Rodríguez, one of his cousins. During the same year, because he opposed a coup d'état, he was put in prison, but got out and left Venezuala. In 1958, Venezuala became a democracy, and Pérez became a part of the government led by Rómulo Betancourt.

In 1973, Pérez became president of Venezuala. He left office in 1979, and soon after, Venezuala's economy went through a low period. In 1989, Pérez became president again. Soon after, he made government spending much smaller and made prices of goods like gasoline higher. There were many riots because of this.

In 1992, there were two coups that tried but failed to remove Pérez from being president. In 1993, though, he was impeached because he was thought to have paid for bodyguards for Violeta Chamorro, who was a former president of Nicaragua. He went to prison after this for ten weeks. After prison he was put in house arrest for two years.

After Hugo Chávez became president of Venezuala in 1998, Pérez went to the Dominican Republic. In 2003, he moved again, this time to the United States. While he was in the US, people in Venezuala tried to force him to return because he was wanted in connection with the riots his laws caused in 1989. He also married Cecilia Matos during this time.

He died on 25 December 2010 in Miami at the age of 88. María Francia Pérez, his daughter, said that he had died of a heart attack.

<doc id="276722" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=276722" title="Light clock">
Light clock

The light clock is a simple way of showing a basic feature of Special relativity. A clock is designed to work by bouncing a flash of light off a distant mirror and using its return to trigger another flash of light, meanwhile counting how many flashes have occurred along the way. It is easy to show that people on Earth watching a spaceship fly overhead with such a clock would see it ticking relatively slowly. This effect is called time dilation.

Before we study the light clock, consider another kind of relativity. Imagine that someone is dribbling a basketball in the hold of a large cargo jet. The basketball player is moving in the same direction as the jet airplane. The other people in the plane see him moving a meter or two as he makes one dribble. Between the time the ball bounces the first time and the ball bounces the second time, about one second has passed. But when the first bounce occurred the basketball was over Gibraltar, and when the second bounce occurred the basketball was over the coast of Spain. So the basketball has moved 28 km. with respect to Earth.

Now consider a somewhat similar question of relative motion. This time we are going to consider what people looking at stars from the North Pole see when a very fast spaceship flies over them. We can use algebra and the Pythagorean theorem to calculate how much time slows on the spaceship. The only other thing we need is the equation that relates distance, d, rate or speed of travel, r, and time, t. The equation is:

d = rt

The speed of light is constant, so we will apply this value to two problems. We will call the speed of light c, as this is the letter scientists usually use to name it.

A clock is made by putting a light output at the bottom of a long pole, a mirror on top of the pole, and an electronic light detector down at the bottom of the pole. The clock is started by briefly closing a switch that sends one blink of light from the bottom of the pole to the top of the pole where it is reflected back to the bottom of the pole. When the light detector at the bottom of the pole sees the blink of light it does two things. It adds one to the counter that is attached to it, and it fires another blink of light up to the mirror. When that blink of light gets back to the bottom, the count changes to two, and another blink of light is set off. Since light travels very rapidly (300,000 kilometers/second), for each second measured by an ordinary clock the light clock will "tick" a very large number of times. 

To make the math easier, we will say that the pole is one half kilometer long. So if we are standing by the light clock that is built next to the big telescope at the North Pole, we will see that light travels one kilometer for each "tick" of the light clock. Since distance traveled, d, equals speed multiplied by time, and the speed involved is c, we have the equation:

d = ct

and we can solve this equation for t to learn how long in seconds each "tick" is.

1 km = 300,000 km/second * t seconds

t seconds = 1 km/300,000 (km/second) = 1/300,000 seconds = 0.00000333…3 seconds

In other words, each "tick" of the light clock will take 0.00000333…3 seconds.

If a spaceship were flying on a straight line passing over the North Pole at a large fraction of the speed of light, and it had a similar clock, people watching its passage would see that the mirror on top of the pole had moved from directly over the emitting light, so the light would travel along the line marked h in the diagram, and then it would follow the other hypotenuse back down to the base of the pole -- which would by now have moved some distance since the spaceship is moving so fast. We can figure out how much time one tick would take according to the people on Earth. We know that the spaceship's pole has a length of a since it is the same kind of clock as people are using at the North Pole. We want to figure out t' , the time it takes to make one tick of the clock on the spaceship.

We know that the spaceship will travel 1/2 r t' while the blink of light is heading up toward the mirror, and another 1/2 r t' while the blink of light is heading down toward the base of the pole. So that calculation gives us the length of line b in the chart. We know a, so we can figure out h by the Pythagorean theorem:

h = √(a + (rt' /2))

So the total distance the light travels is 2 h or d = 2 √(a + (rt' /2))

We also know that the speed of light, c, is constant. No matter who measures it, it turns out to be the same speed. So we can use that fact to get another way of calculating how long it takes for the flash of light to go from the base to the top of the pole and back again:

t' = d/c

In other words, d = c t' .

So we can write

c t' = 2 √(a + (rt' /2))

or

1/2 c t' = √(a + (rt' /2))

To solve the above equation, we will need to:

If t = 1 second, then if the spaceship is traveling at one half the speed of light, t' = 1.1547 sec.

The Narrows

The Narrows is the tidal strait splitting up the New York City boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn. It connects the Upper and Lower New York Bay and makes the channel where the Hudson River can empty into the Atlantic Ocean. It is believed that the Narrows were most likely formed after deposition of the Harbor Hill Moraine about 18,000 years ago just before to the end of the last ice age. . Staten Island and Brooklyn used to be connected and the Hudson River emptied into the ocean through the Raritan River and taking course through present day northern New Jersey. A build up of water in the Upper Bay allowed the river to break through to form the Narrows less than 12,000 to 13,000 years ago as it exists today.

The first recorded European entrance into the Narrows was in 1524 by Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, who set anchor in the strait and was greeted by a group of Lenape in canoes.

Remagen

Remagen is a town in Germany in Rhineland-Palatinate, in the district of Ahrweiler. It is about a one hour drive from Cologne , just south of Bonn, the former capital of West Germany. It is on the River Rhine. There is a ferry across the Rhine from Remagen every 10–15 minutes in the summer. Remagen has many historic buildings, churches, castles and monuments. Cars are banned from the big pedestrian zone which has plenty of shops.

Overlooking the west bank of the Rhine just north of the city centre is a church called the "Apollinariskirche". It has an observation deck that is only open to parishioners on Sundays. Walkers reach the church via a dirt track that passes a series of roadside monuments. One for each of the fourteen Stations of the Cross. The church grounds contain an outdoor crypt and an abbey. Further down the river is one of the many castles along the River Rhine, perched even higher than the Apollinariskirche.

The Roman Empire built a border fort at Rigomagus (or Ricomagus), west of the Rhine. This was about 12 miles north of the site of the first bridge ever built across the Rhine (at Neuwied). 

The fort was one of several built by Drusus, commander of the Roman army along the Rhine. The gateway still survives and is a popular tourist attraction.

Local legend says that a ship carrying various relics from Milan to Cologne was stopped in the river in 1164, unable to move despite the strong current, until it mysteriously edged in toward the shore. The remains of St Apollinaris were put ashore, and the ship was then able to sail onward. These remains were buried in a chapel which had been part of the Roman fort, which became the basis for a church which bore his name, and was rebuilt several times over the years.

In 1945 the U.S. built one of the many enclosures on the west bank of the Rhine—the so called Rheinwiesenlager— close to Remagen. The camps were used by the Allies to house captured Germans, often under very poor conditions. Several thousand prisoners are estimated to have died in the various camps, including 1,212 who are now buried in the Bad Bodendorf Cemetery. They were deprived of the legal protection that the Geneva Convention provides prisoners of war by being called Disarmed Enemy Forces. The International Red Cross was not permitted to investigate conditions in the camps.

The Apollinariskirche was built 1839-1842 on the site of the medieval Martinskirche. The frescos on the inside of the neo-Gothic church were painted by members of the artists group called the "Nazarenes". Three cycles show the life of Jesus, the life of Mary, and the history of Saint Apollinaris, legendary Bishop of Ravenna. In the crypt is a silver bust of the saint, which is raised from the sarcophagus every year at the pilgrimage time at the end of July. From the statue of Saint Francis of Assisi on top of the church, there is a lovely view of Remagen and the romantic Rhine Valley.

Remagen Railway Bridge was the first bridge across the Rhine captured in World War II
The museum is housed in the towers of the famous bridge built between 1916 and 1918. It opened in 1980 and tells the story of the bridge and the prison camp, "Golden Mile."

The historic railway station at Rolandseck now houses a museum devoted to the work of Hans Arp. The 19th century railway station was transformed into a cultural venue for all the arts. Johannes Brahms, Clara Schumann and Franz Liszt gave concerts there. The young poet Guillaume Apollinaire even fell in love there. The building was almost destroyed after World War II, but in 1964 the Bonn art dealer Johannes Wasmuth brought it back to life. Musicians such as Martha Argerich, Stefan Askenase, and Yehudi Menuhin, artists such as Hans Arp, Oskar Kokoschka and Günther Uecker, and performers such as Marcel Marceau have all appeared there.

Salvador Jorge Blanco

José Salvador Omar Jorge Blanco, (5 July 1926 - 26 December 2010) was the 41st President of the Dominican Republic. He was the first Dominican president to be charged with corruption.

Blanco was born in Santiago de los Caballeros and studied law at the University of Santa Dominigo. He went into politics in the 1960's after the dictator Rafael Leónidas Trujillo was murdered. He joined a social democratic party, the Partido Revolucionario Dominicano (PRD). Blanco became leader of the party and won the 1982 presidential election.

At the same time Blanco became president, the world price on sugar dropped. The economy of the Dominican Republic was in a financial crisis as the government was spending far more than the country could afford and was three billion dollars in debt. The International Money Fund demanded cuts to spending. There were protests and riots. Blanco sent in the army to crush the protests: more than 100 people were killed, 500 wounded and thousands were put in prison. It was claimed that Blanco and other members of the government were making a lot of money through corrupt dealings with the army and military contracts.

Blanco did not stand in the 1986 election, and the new government put him on trial for corruption. He tried to gain asylum from Venezualea, but they said no. He was permitted to go the United States for medical treatment for a heart condition. While he was in the US he was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to prison for 23 years. There were many legal challenges, and he finally only spent two months in prison. In 2001 the Supreme Court ruled that the corruption charges were not true.

He died in 2010 after falling out of bed and hitting his head.

Atticus Finch is a fictional (not real) character in Harper Lee's book "To Kill a Mockingbird". Atticus is a lawyer who lives in Alabama. He is the father of Jeremy Atticus "Jem" Finch and Jean Louise "Scout" Finch. Atticus is an important character in the book.

In "To Kill a Mockingbird", Atticus is shown as a good character, trying to live in the way he thinks a lawyer and human being should. He is very honest, thoughtful, and helps good causes (even when he knows that they will fail). He tries hard to teach his children to be kind, fair, and giving. His children later find out that he was an expert at shooting, but had not told them because he did not want them to think he was violent. He is described in the book as a tall, middle-aged man with glasses and hair that is going a little gray.

Alice Petry said that Atticus has "become something of a folk hero in legal circles and is treated almost as if he were an actual person." Examples of Atticus Finch's impact on the legal profession are plentiful. Morris Dees says that Atticus Finch was the reason he became a lawyer, and Richard Matsch said that Atticus influenced him greatly. Some people, however, criticize Atticus, saying that does not use his legal skills to change the racism in his town.

Sheldon Kennedy

Sheldon Kennedy (born June 15, 1969) is a former professional ice hockey player. He played for the Detroit Red Wings, Boston Bruins and Calgary Flames in the National Hockey League (NHL). Kennedy was drafted by the Red Wings in the fourth round of the 1988 NHL Entry Draft while playing with the Swift Current Broncos of the Western Hockey League (WHL). In the WHL, Kennedy helped the Broncos capture the 1989 Memorial Cup, and was named to the tournament all-star team. Kennedy represented Canada internationally at the World Junior Championships in 1988 and 1989. He helped Canada win a gold medal at the 1988 tournament.

Kennedy is best known for coming forward as a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of his coach, Graham James. In 1998, Kennedy roller bladed across Canada to raise awareness and funds for sexual abuse victims. Currently, Kennedy serves as a spokesperson for violence and abuse prevention programs with the Canadian Red Cross.

Kennedy started playing junior hockey with the Winnipeg South Blues of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League (MJHL) in 1985. After being noticed by Graham James at a hockey camp, Kennedy joined the Swift Current Broncos of the Western Hockey League (WHL) for the 1986–87 season. Kennedy spent his entire WHL career with the Broncos, helping the team capture the 1989 Memorial Cup. For his play during the tournament, Kennedy was named to the Memorial Cup All-Star Team. He was also named to the WHL's Eastern Conference Second All-Star Team.
Kennedy was selected by the Detroit Red Wings in the fourth round (80th overall) of the 1988 National Hockey League (NHL) Entry Draft. His first professional season was split between the Red Wings in the NHL and their minor league affiliate Adirondack Red Wings of the American Hockey League (AHL). At the NHL level, Kennedy scored two goals and added seven assists in 20 games. Kennedy spent the next four seasons bouncing between the AHL and NHL within the Red Wings organization. The Winnipeg Jets acquired Kennedy from the Red Wings after the 1993–94 season. The NHL lockout meant that Kennedy did not actually play for the Jets before being picked up on waivers by the Calgary Flames. Kennedy spent two seasons in Calgary, then the Flames decided not to renew his contract in 1996, shortly after his sexual abuse revelation. He signed as a free agent with the Boston Bruins for the 1996–97 season but also spent time with the Providence Bruins, Boston's AHL affiliate. The 1996–97 season was Kennedy's last campaign in the NHL but he later resurfaced in the 1998–99 season with the Manitoba Moose of the now-defunct International Hockey League. Kennedy also played for EV Landshut of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga in Germany during the 1998–99 season.

A television movie about his life and campaign, "The Sheldon Kennedy Story", aired on CTV in 1999. Jonathan Scarfe starred as Kennedy. In 2006 he released his autobiography, "Why I Didn't Say Anything - The Sheldon Kennedy Story". In the book he revealed that nightmares of James still continue to plague him. He also wrote frankly about his battles with cocaine addiction.

Luminiferous aether

Luminiferous aether is something once believed to fill the Universe and explain how the transmission of waves of light can happen. People believed that light was a kind of wave. Waves travel over the surface of water in a pond, through the air in a room, etc. All waves that people had studied before had traveled through something. Sound waves traveled faster through steel than through air. So people imagined that light had to travel through something too. Since light travels faster than anything else, light should travel through something more rigid (like steel) than anything else. But at the same time this substance would have to be entirely yielding so that it would not slow down the movements of planets and cause them to eventually fall into their suns. The people coming before Albert Einstein believed this stuff to exist, and they called it the "Luminiferous aether." 

If we were traveling on a boat moving through an ocean current, then we could see changes in the rate that waves appeared to travel depending on whether we were moving with the current, across the current, or against the current. 

People who studied the physics of this problem made experiments to try to make this question become clear. The Michelson-Morley Experiment showed that there was no substance through which light traveled. This negative result was a great success for science. It took down one untrue belief that stood in our way of true understanding. It said that there is no luminiferous aether.

The easiest way to see the general idea is to imagine a very fast spaceship moving at one half the speed of light from one star to another. The spaceship has two light-speed meters, one pointing backward and one pointing forward. Since the spaceship is running away from the photons given off by the yellow star, and running toward the photons given off by the blue star, our ordinary experience leads us to expect that we would measure the speed of the yellow photons as 150,000 kilometers per second, and the speed of the blue photons as 450,000 kilometers per second. But the truth is that both photons are measured at 300,000 km/sec. That result indicates that speeds do not add up the way we ordinarily expect speeds to add together.

Albert Einstein made a basic change in how we understand things. He said that light always moves at 300,000 km/sec and we just have to accept that fact. If we do, then we will find that everything else makes sense. If we do not accept that fact, then we will have to make up explanations for all sorts of inconsistencies. We do not need the hypothesis of the luminiferous aether.

http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/40355 A recent study is much more precise than the one by Michelson and Morley, but it still shows that the speed of light is constant no matter which direction one is moving in.

Lorentz contraction

The Lorentz contraction is also known as the Fitzgerald contraction or the Lorenz-Fitzgerald contraction. It is a result of relativistic effects perceived between observers moving with respect to one another. The size of one object as observed by someone moving with respect to it is decreased along their line of approach by an amount mathematically related to their closing velocity and the speed of light.

In his book, "One, Two, Three...Infinity," physicist George Gamow quoted a limerick that is alleged by some to have been altered from a more bawdy version. There are several other cleaned up versions:
There once was a young man named Fisk,<br>
Whose fencing was extremely brisk,<br>
So fast was his action,<br>
The Lorentz contraction,<br>
Foreshortened his foil to a disk.<br>

Elisabeth Schwarzkopf

Dame Elisabeth Schwarzkopf DBE (born in Jarotschin in Prussia, 9 December 1915; died Schruns, Austria, 3 August 2006) was a German-born Austrian/British soprano. She was one of the most famous opera singers of the 20th century as well as a famous recitalist. She was particularly known for singing the music of Mozart, Schubert, Strauss, and Wolf.

Elisabeth Schwarzkopf was born in Jarotschin in the province of Posen in Prussia. Schwarzkopf showed an interest in music from an early age. She first sang in an opera in 1928 when she took the part of Eurydice in a school production of Gluck's "Orfeo ed Euridice" in Magdeburg, Germany. In 1934, Schwarzkopf started to study in Berlin Hochschule für Musik, then she changed teachers and started working with the coloratura soprano Maria Ivogün as well as with Ivogün's husband, the pianist Michael Raucheisen.

Schwarzkopf gave her first professional performance at the Deutsche Oper Berlin on 15 April 1938, as the Second Flower Maiden (First Group) in Act II of Richard Wagner's "Parsifal". She sang in Berlin for four years, during which time she joined the Nazi Party. Because of this she was later not allowed to appear in the United States. 

In 1942, she was invited to sing with the Vienna State Opera, where her roles included Konstanze in Mozart's "Die Entführung aus dem Serail", Musetta and later Mimì in Puccini's "La bohème" and Violetta in Verdi's" La traviata".

In 1945, Schwarzkopf was given Austrian citizenship so that she would be allowed to sing in the Vienna State Opera. In 1947 and 1948, Schwarzkopf appeared on tour with the Vienna State Opera at London's Royal Opera House at Covent Garden on 16 September 1947 as Donna Elvira in Mozart's "Don Giovanni" and at La Scala on 28 December 1948, as the Countess in Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro", which became one of her most famous roles.

From that time on she was invited to sing all over the world, including at La Scala, Milan and the San Francisco Opera.

In March 1946, Schwarzkopf had been invited to audition for Walter Legge. Legge was a man who produced classical music recordings in Britain. He had founded the Philharmonia Orchestra. Legge asked Schwarzkopf to sing Hugo Wolf's lied "Wer rief dich denn?". He thought she was so good that he gave her an exclusive contract with EMI. They worked a lot together, and they were married on 19 October 1953 in Epsom, Surrey; Schwarzkopf now had British citizenship because of her marriage to an Englishman. 

In the 1960s, when Schwarzkopf sang in operas she nearly always sang one of her five favourite operatic roles: Donna Elvira in Mozart's "Don Giovanni", Countess Almaviva in "The Marriage of Figaro", Fiordiligi in "Così fan tutte", Countess Madeleine in Strauss's "Capriccio", and the Marschallin in "Der Rosenkavalier". She was also good at singing Alice Ford in Verdi's "Falstaff". On the EMI label she made several "champagne operetta" recordings like Franz Lehár's "The Merry Widow" and Johann Strauss II's "The Gypsy Baron".

Schwarzkopf's last operatic performance was as the Marschallin on 31 December 1971, in the theatre of La Monnaie in Brussels. For the next several years, she only sang in lieder recitals. 

On 17 March 1979, Walter Legge had a serious heart attack. His doctors told him to rest, but instead of resting he went to Schwarzkopf's last recital two days later in Zurich. Three days later, he died. 

After retiring, Schwarzkopf taught and gave master classes around the world, especially at the Juilliard School in New York City. She was well known for being an extremely strict teacher who stopped her pupils to criticize every little bit of detail. After living in Switzerland for many years, she went to live in Vorarlberg, Austria.

She was made a doctor of music by the University of Cambridge in 1976, and became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1992. She received many other awards.

Schwarzkopf died in her sleep during the night of 2–3 August 2006 at her home in the village of Schruns, in Vorarlberg, western Austria, aged 90.

Christogram IHS

The Christogram IHS – a monogram being a symbol of Jesus Christ in form of acronym.

From Greek it is an abbreviation of the name IHΣΟΥΣ (Jesus).

In Eastern Orthodox Church the Christogram is composed with letters "X" and "P" and "I" and "X" arranged into the cross. They are the first letters of one from two words in Greek language: "Christ" and "Jesus Christ".

In the Western culture there exist the compositions: "IHS" and also "IHC" being the first letters (iota-eta-sigma) of the name Jesus in Greek alphabet: ΙΗΣΟΥΣ (Ίησοῦς or ΙΗϹΟΥϹ with lunated sigma). The abbreviation in form "IHS" appeared in first time on the coins of Justinian II on the turn of the 7th and 8th centuries.

The order of Jesuits, in other words the Society of Jesus ("Societas Iesu"), addopted "IHS" as its fixed emblem - the symbol in 17th century. There appeared also Latin interpretations of the abbreviation "IHS", among others:
and also:

These developped inscriptions were formed the most probably because in Middle Ages people in wrong way had read the letter E as H.

According to a legend, this inscription with the cross was seen by emperor Constantine the Great in his sleep before the battle against Maxentius in 312 on the Ponte Milvio.

Commentators unfriendly to the Catholic Church sometimes interpret the abbreviation IHS as derived from the solar idols of the Egyptian mythology: Isis, Horus and Seth. Nevertheless, present scientific knowledge do not confirm such interpretations.

Alfred Sisley

Alfred Sisley (30 October 1839 – 29 January 1899) was an English Impressionist landscape painter. He was born, and spent most of his life, in France. Sisley is known for his Impressionist landscapes painted "en plein air", that is outdoors. He never went into portrait painting and, unlike Renoir and Pissarro, found that Impressionism fulfilled his artistic needs. 

Among his most important works are a series of paintings of the River Thames, mostly around Hampton Court, painted in 1874, and various paintings showing places in or near Moret-sur-Loing.

Sisley was born in Paris to rich English parents. His father William Sisley was in the silk business, and his mother Felicia Sell enjoyed music. In 1857, at the age of 18, Sisley was sent to London to study for a career in business, but he gave it up after four years and returned to Paris. In 1862 he studied at the atelier of Swiss artist Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre, where he met Frédéric Bazille, Claude Monet, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. 

Together they would paint landscapes in the open rather than in the studio. This helped them to capture the changing effects of sunlight. This new approach resulted in paintings more colorful and more broadly painted than people were used to seeing. At first Sisley and his friends had few chances to show or sell their work. Their works were usually rejected by the jury of the most important art exhibition in France, the annual Salon. During the 1860s, though, Sisley was in a better position than some of his fellow artists, for his father regularly gave him money. 

In 1866 Sisley began a relationship with Eugénie Lesouezec (1834–1898; also known as Marie Lescouezec). They had two children: son Pierre (born 1867) and daughter Jeanne (1869). At the time, Sisley lived not far from Avenue de Clichy and the Café Guerbois, the meeting place of many Parisian painters. In 1868 his paintings were accepted at the Salon, but it did not bring him any financial or critical success, and neither did any of the subsequent exhibitions.
The Franco-Prussian War which began in 1870 caused Sisley's father's business to fail. The painter's only income was from the sale of his works. He lived in poverty for the rest of his life, as the value of his paintings only rose in value after his death. Occasionally, however, Sisley would be helped by his patrons, which allowed him, among other things, to make a few short trips to England. The first trip was in 1874 after the first independent Impressionist exhibition. The result of the trip was a series of nearly 20 paintings of the Upper Thames near Molesey. Art historian Kenneth Clark said this was "a perfect moment of Impressionism."

Until 1880, Sisley lived and worked in the countryside west of Paris; then Sisley and his family moved to a small village near Moret-sur-Loing. This was close to the forest of Fontainebleau where the painters of the Barbizon school had worked earlier in the century. Here, as art historian Anne Poulet has said, "the gentle landscapes with their constantly changing atmosphere were perfectly attuned to his talents. Unlike Monet, he never sought the drama of the rampaging ocean or the brilliantly colored scenery of the Côte d'Azur." In 1881 Sisley made one more short trip to England. 

In 1897 Sisley and his partner visited Wales and were married in Cardiff Register Office on 5 August. They stayed at Penarth, where he painted at least six pictures of the sea and the cliffs. In mid-August they moved to the Osborne Hotel on the Gower Peninsula, where he painted at least eleven oil-paintings in and around Rotherslade Bay. They returned to France in October. This was Sisley's last trip to England. The National Museum of Wales in Cardiff now has two of his Welsh paintings.

In 1898 he applied for French citizenship but was refused. He made a second application supported by a police report. He became ill before the application was accepted, with Sisley remaining English till his death. The painter died in Moret-sur-Loing at the age of 59, just a few months after the death of his wife.

Sisley's first works are lost. His earliest known work is "Lane near a Small Town". This is believed to have been painted around 1864. His first landscape paintings are sad and gloomy, coloured with dark browns, greens, and pale blues. They were often painted at Marly and Saint-Cloud. No one knows if Sisley's knew the paintings of J. M. W. Turner and John Constable, which he may have seen in London. These artists have been suggested as an influence on his development as an Impressionist painter, as well as Gustave Courbet and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot.

Among the Impressionists Sisley has been overshadowed by Monet. Sisley's work very similar to that of Camille Pissarro. Described by art historian Robert Rosenblum as having "almost a generic character, an impersonal textbook idea of a perfect Impressionist painting", his work strongly creates atmosphere and his skies are always very impressive. His concentration on landscape subjects was the most consistent of any of the Impressionists.

Among Sisley's best-known works are "Street in Moret" and "Sand Heaps", and "The Bridge at Moret-sur-Loing" shown at Musée d'Orsay, Paris. "Allée des peupliers de Moret" ("The Lane of Poplars at Moret") has been stolen three times from the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Nice. The first time was in 1978 when on loan in Marseille, but it was found a few days later in the city's sewers. It was stolen again in 1998 and the museum's curator was convicted of the theft and jailed for five years along with two friends. It was stolen again in August 2007. On 4 June 2008, the French National Police found it and three other stolen paintings inside a van in Marseille.

Inflorescence

An inflorescence is a flowering stem. The term is most used for a group or cluster of flowers arranged on a stem. It is a very common arrangement, which keeps the flowers together.

Sometimes the inflorescence is so tight it looks like one single flower. What you see as a single daisy is actually formed of several hundred tiny flowers packed together. 

Sometimes it is just a close bunch of flowers (e.g. "Antirrhinum") on a "spike". 

An inflorescence is the reproductive portion of a plant; each plant bears its flowers in a specific pattern.

The advantages of the inflorescence mode is all about reproduction compared to a single primitive flower of the "Magnolia" type.

Hesperornis

Hesperornis is an extinct genus of flightless aquatic birds that lived during the Upper Cretaceous (89–65 million years ago).

"Hesperornis" was an important early find in the history of avian paleontology. It was discovered by the paleontologist O.C. Marsh in the late 19th century Bone Wars. 

Famous locations for "Hesperornis" are the Upper Cretaceous marine limestones from Kansas and the marine shales from Canada. The genus probably had a Holarctic distribution.

"Hesperornis" was a large bird, reaching up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) in length. It had virtually no wings, and swam with its powerful hind legs. 

Like many other Mesozoic birds such as "Ichthyornis", "Hesperornis" had teeth in its beak which were used to hold prey (most likely fish).

"Hesperornis" hunted in the waters of such contemporary shelf seas as the North American Inland Sea, the Turgai Strait and the prehistoric North Sea, which then were subtropical to tropical waters, much warmer than today. They probably fed mainly on fish, maybe also crustaceans, cephalopods and mollusks, as do the diving seabirds of today. Their teeth were helpful in dealing with slippery or hard-shelled prey.

On land, "Hesperornis" species may or may not have been able to walk. They certainly could not stand upright like penguins as in the early reconstructions. Their legs attached far at the back and sideways, with even the lower leg being tightly attached to the body (see photo of skeleton). Thus, they were limited to a clumsy hobble at best on land and would have been more nimble if they moved by sliding on their belly or galumphing. The leg skeleton of "Hesperornis" was so thoroughly adapted to diving that their mode on land, and their egg-laying and parental care, is a matter of speculation.

Young "Hesperornis" grew fairly quickly and continuously to adulthood, as is the case in modern birds. More young birds are known from the fossil record of the more northerly sites than from those further south. This suggests that at least some species were migratory like today's penguins, which swim polewards in the summer.

"Hesperornis" was preyed upon by large marine carnivores such as mosasaurs. A "Tylosaurus" specimen contains the bones of a "Hesperornis" in its gut area.

There seems to be a bit of inconsistency with regard to the closure of bureacurat nominations. Recently was closed as unsuccessful at 17/4, which was under the current bar of 85%. However, I want to have a discussion about this bar, because I think it should be lowered.

Recently, we introduced a (fairly successful) system of appointing bureaucrats after two endorsements from other bureaucrats. The two endorsements ensured the candidate's success, without having to wait the standard seven days for community opinions (note that I'm aware crats may defer to the seven day election in the case of divided community opinion early in the process). However, now that we have this system, we need to be more flexible on the requirements. 85% seems absurdly high for a community election in which two crats could simply end the process by promoting the user anyway. At 81%, it is incredibly clear that the community was happy about this promotion.

We currently allow CheckUsers and oversighters access to the tools at 70%. We allow administrators access at 75%. Since the bureaucrat user group is not particularly controversial or dangerous, especially now we have the two-crat rule, we need to even out the percentages here.  () 20:27, 21 January 2011 (UTC)

We have a category 'Nobel Prize for Medicine winners' whereas the actual Prize is for Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. In this case I think the category title should match the Prize title because many of the winners were not for medicine, and quite a few did not even have medical degrees. Notice, too, that all categories in the Nobel set use 'for' instead of 'in', but that's less serious. 

I bring this here because there is a whole bunch of pages which would need changing, and I'm sure one of our 'category' specialists knows how to do it! () 10:34, 10 February 2011 (UTC)

English is not my mothertongue therefore I would like to find somebody who can read my edits and change severe mistakes 

As one of the aims for the simple English wiki is to help people learn English, I propose my GoogleTrans-Speak gadget for the wiki.

Using GoogleTrans a popup will appear near the cursor, having a foreign language translation of the word (or selected text < 500 characters), when the cursor is over a word in a web page and the SHIFT key is pressed.

The help file on the enwiki for the gadget is at:

en:User:Endo999/GoogleTrans

The gadget has been running on the enwiki for around 18 months now and has had around 8500 installs (after 6 months of use). It is currently running on 12 wikis.

It can be run on the simple enwiki by including the following javascript in your vector.js file:

importScript("User:Endo999/GoogleTrans.js");

This version has the following text to speech addition:

The idea is that people wishing to learn English may not just want the translation of a word or two (or a sentence or two) they don't know, but also may wish to hear the sentence to train their ears (and thus learn to listen to English as well as read it).

I use the gadget (on my private test system) to read French and Spanish webpages, including the eswiki and the frwiki, since I can read those languages but cannot understand spoken speech of those tongues.

The Text To Speech is actually done on my LINUX box in Canberra Australia, so I would like to try out the feature on a small wiki (like the Simple wiki) so the number of requests isn't too large.

Open Source Text to Speech systems are used:

On Firefox 3.5+ a HTML5 audio tag plays an OGG sound file. On IE9 a HTML5 audio tag plays an MP3 sound file On other systems, Flash is needed, a Flash sound bar will play an MP3 sound file.

I think some people learning English may like to play a computer voice of some text in wiki articles. It's a good way to learn to listen to English. You can have the translation into your native language, and then you can listen to the English text selected right in front of you. Listening to the radio and TV is often difficult because the native speakers speak too fast. Festival TTS does not speak too quickly.

You can play the sound bar more than once if you need to listen several times.

It's a good language learning tool and I thought it would be a good gadget for the simple English wiki, which is a language learning wiki.

I'm not sure whether to put this here or in Peer Review, but would appreciate some feedback on . Background: I started on some constellation articles. This seems like an obvious set of articles that should be improved for students to use, and they really need simplification from the sometimes very technical pages on En. Hope to get to the rest of the constellations over time--seems like a fun and useful project.

All the pages on En have a Template for the 88 Modern Constellations. I copied and pasted that over and the required Constellations/modern/modern-list. I began adding the template to our existing constellation articles and realized that some have _(constellation) added and some do not. This is also reflected in doubled up pages such as Scorpius and Scorpius_(constellation). I added _(constellation) to some obvious ones like Lyra and Apus which do not yet exist but could have multiple meanings. 

I think the right thing to do would be to just standardize on adding _(constellation) to all constellation pages and setting up redirects or disambiguation from the common name. Even if something does not have a duplicate meaning now, it may in the future. Companies like to use these for branding etc. It seems to make sense to just standardize on one style. I thought I'd ask here before I amended the list and started all of those redirects since it would be a pain to undo if it was the wrong way to go. Any advice?

Hi,

I've had this page, Simple talk, on my watchlist for quite some time. It seems that many (most) changes to this page are never reflected in my watchlist. I have namespace set to "All", and not hiding anything. If I look at the last seven days, the only change that shows on my watchlist is Sonia's recent comment on "New in this here in Simple Wikipedia land". Some other changes on watched pages seemed to not show up on my watchlist in the past, but it wasn't so obvious. Here is a screenshot. Is "My watchlist" reliable? Or is there something I have to do? (But, if you reply, I might not see it!) Thanks, () 01:57, 26 February 2011 (UTC)

This is a rather selfish request from someone who lurks at Simple English Wikipedia and actively edits on English "Wikinews". At present, will go to the "Wiki not found" notice. As English and Simple English are so inherently similar, why not redirect simple.wikinews.org to en.wikinews.org (and simplewikisource → enwikisource, etc), if only so that the interwikis work in a slightly nicer way. — 
I'm not sure about actually redirecting the domains, but I at least think the interwiki links (. , , . , everything except wiktionary) should be changed. () 18:19, 22 February 2011 (UTC)

In light of the recent, and previous, steward elections, it might be a good idea to see if the community wants some sort of guideline now that quite a few of us are now also stewards. Things to think about are; use of global rights locally (i.e. CU,OS,crat). Thoughts? 01:51, 28 February 2011 (UTC)
It's not required to establish something because already tells us what to do, the question is whether or not, like , , commons etc... and have a local guideline/policy. I think it's a good idea because we now have a disproportionate amount of stewards within our project for the size of it. I think it'll help keep us all clear who can/can not do what. For instance, I can now technically use oversight once again, even though I've resigned. Of course, I won't use it as I am not locally elected to do so any more. It's questions like these that need clarifying for greater transparency imo. 09:51, 28 February 2011 (UTC)

KISS: If a Steward is given the flag locally they can use it, if they're not they cannot unless there's some ueber major crisis when no other non-local Stewards are around. Make sense? :P 23:43, 28 February 2011 (UTC) 

Wikipedia notoriously hides its tools and most stuff relating structuring Wik. It would really be nice if there were an easy-to-find way of finding out how to do stuff, for example, a search box for meta-Wik. I'll give you an example of why I need this. A lot of editors through around abbreviations. They make texts ununderstandable at times and, if not blue-linked, unsupported in many cases (since if I don't know the basis of an argument, I can't accept it. For example, 'your artilce on X is WP:NonNot, so I'm erasing it.' Well, how can I tell if it is or is not if 1) I can't tell what the abbreviation stands for and/or 2) I can't know the policy criteria? This problem varies from Wik to Wik, but Simple English Wik in particular pretty much has me baffled.05:49, 1 March 2011 (UTC) -- () 09:07, 1 March 2011 (UTC)

I am a word person, not a symbol person. I searched for some time in SE Wik to find a tab indicating that I wanted to follow an article.

Hello everyone. While patrolling , I noticed that it was quite backlogged (over 200 pages). Most of the recent unpatrolled pages had been created by active non-admins of the wiki. I suggest we enable the autopatrol flag and give it to these users to reduce the New Pages backlog. This would help admins in patrolling new pages, and would prevent unsourced pages/vandalism/test pages lying undeleted in the wiki. Regards, ( · · ) 11:49, 24 February 2011 (UTC)


As support seems to mounting for this, I just thought I'd raise the specifics of the issue so that we then have everything that we require to be able to get this accepted in Bugzilla if the consensus appears. I would personally suggest that the right is able to be given out by Administrators (Like the Flood Flag and Rollback) and can be requested in the same way as Rollback on a special subpage of RfP. The requirements for the right should basically be "Is a trusted content creator" imo, though that's probably the bit that needs the most discussion about. I would class a 'Trusted content creator' as someone who has been around for some time and has a need for the flag - i.e. is regularly creating articles. In many ways it's just as "powerful" as Flood and Rollback, though in others much less so - you're only changing something from yellow to white... 09:10, 28 February 2011 (UTC) 
I'm in full support of this. () 13:48, 2 March 2011 (UTC)

Binge eating is when people suddenly feel the urge to eat much more than is healthy. Many people binge eat at some point in their life.

If binge eating becomes a pattern, this is an eating disorder. People who suffer from this have a high risk of weight gain. They may feel ashamed of their eating habits and become depressed. 

People who binge and then purge (usually by vomiting) have a different eating disorder called bulimia.

Cline

In biology, a cline, or 'ecocline', describes a series of connected populations in a species. These populations show a continuous gradient of characters and genetics. The term was coined by the English evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley in 1938. He defined a cline as a species whose members fall into a series of sub-species with continuous change in characters over a geographical area. 

Clines consist of forms of a species that show gradual phenotypic and/or genetic differences over a geographical area. 

The reason for these differences is that the environment is somewhat different in different parts of the range. Populations become adapted to the situation in their areas, but this adaptation is limited by gene flow between neighbouring sub-species.
Genetically, clines result from the change of allele frequencies within the gene pool of the species in question.

Battle of Fort Washington

The Battle of Fort Washington was one of the many battles fought in the American Revolutionary War between the United States and Great Britain that took place on 16 November 1776. The British won the battle.

After winning against the Continental Army (ruled by George Washington), the British army (ruled by William Howe) wanted to capture Fort Washington, the last American stronghold in Manhattan. Washington had thought of leaving the Fort and moving its military camp of 3,000 men to New Jersey, but had been convinced by General Nathaniel Greene to defend (fight for) it.

On 16 November, Howe attacked the fort. The assault came from three different directions: the north, east and south. The attack was put off for a short time because of the tides in the Harlem River that stopped some of the troops from landing. When the attack did begin, the southern and western American defenses fell quickly. In the North there was better defense against the attack, but they eventually weakened as well. With the fort surrounded by land and sea the Fort's commander, Robert Magaw, chose to surrender the fort rather than try to hold out. A total of 59 Americans were killed and 2,837 became prisoners of the British. With this defeat, the main American army under George Washington was chased across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania, setting the stage for the battles of Trenton and Princeton.

It broke out in the when the British military forces had first occupied the city during the American Revolutionary War.

The fire destroyed 10 to 25% of the city, and some unburned parts of the city were ransacked. Many people believed or thought that one or more people started the fire on purpose, for many of different reasons. British leaders accused American rebels of starting the fire, and most assumed that one side or the other had started it.

The mica group of minerals are aluminosilicates with various metals. They split into fine sheets. 

Mica includes several closely related materials having perfect basal cleavage. 

All are monoclinic with a tendency towards pseudo-hexagonal crystals and are similar in chemical composition. The highly perfect cleavage, which is the most prominent characteristic of mica, is explained by the hexagonal sheet-like arrangement of its atoms.

The Charophyceae are the green algae closest to plants.

Their exact rank is the matter of some debate. Some botanists recommend expanding the existing plant kingdom to include charophyceans and chlorophytes. 

Others classify Charophyceae as a class under division Charophyta, with Chlorophyta remaining a distinct division. There are also other possibilities. 

The consensus among botanists is that charophyceans are the organisms most closely related to land plants (embryophytes). 

Many of the complex traits related to sexual reproduction, photosynthesis, and other plant characters, evolved first in charophyceans. Analysis of cpDNA (chloroplast DNA) shows that characteristics of plant chloroplasts evolved first in the charophycean genera "Staurastrum" and "Zygnema".

Chlorophyta

Chlorophyta are a division of green algae. 

It includes about 7,000 species of mostly aquatic photosynthetic eukaryote organisms. 

Like the land plants, green algae contain chlorophylls "a" and "b", and store food as starch in their plastids. 

They are related to the Charophyceae and land plants, together making up the Viridiplantae.
The division contains both unicellular and multicellular species. While most species live in freshwater habitats and a large number in marine habitats, other species are adapted to a wide range of environments. Watermelon snow, or "Chlamydomonas nivalis", lives on summer alpine snowfields. Others live attached to rocks or woody parts of trees. Some lichens are symbiotic relationships between fungi and green algae. 

Members of the Chlorophyta also form symbiotic relationships with protozoa, sponges and cnidarians. All are flagellated, and so have an advantage of motility. Some conduct sexual reproduction.

Political views and ideas which are far from the mainstream are called extremist. Such views often violate common moral standards. As an example, a group that wants to replace a democratic form of government with a totalitarian one is almost always considered extremist. Political or religious fundamentalism as well as fanaticism can also be seen as extremist.

What is seen as extremist varies by country. People who support that Muslim women should wear a burqa may be seen as extremist in France, but such an opinion may not be extremist in Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia.

In some classification systems they have been called Plantae, by expanding the traditional Plant Kingdom to include the green algae. 

Adl et al., who produced a classification for all eukaryotes in 2005, introduced the name Chloroplastida for this group, reflecting the group having primary chloroplasts with green chlorophyll. They rejected the name Viridiplantae on the grounds that most of the species are not plants, as understood traditionally.

The monophyletic Chlorophyta and Charophyceae are classified under Viridiplantae. So, a simple arrangement is:
'Green algae' is not used here because they are definitely not monophyletic. It is just a convenience term.

There are more than 350,000 species of Viridiplantae.

In the United States Declaration of Independence, the natural rights mentioned are "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happinesss". The idea was also found in the Declaration of the Rights of Man. It is viewed by Locke, Jefferson, and others that the purpose of government is to protect peoples' natural rights through a social contract.

The Chimera (Greek: Χίμαιρα, "Khimaira", from χίμαρος, "khimaros", "she-goat") according to Greek mythology, is a monstrous creature that was composed of several different animals. The chimera is only one of several famous mythological hybrids. As with all mythical creatures, there is the question of its origin. In some traditions, the Chimera was one of the offspring of Typhon and Echidna and sister of such monsters as Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra. However, the chimera does not appear to have an existence in physical reality, save for the individual animals from which it is composed.

he most common description of the chimera comes from Homer's "Illiad", in which the creature is said to have the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and tail of a snake. It is also believed to breath fire and be female, despite the mane adorning the lions head. The chimera was said to be incredibly vicious and powerful, especially since as one single creature, it possessed the abilities of three separate animals.

Skandar Keynes

Skandar Keynes, or ‘”Alexander Amin Caspar Keynes” is a British actor, born 5 September 1991. He starred Edmund Pevensie in The Chronicles of Narnia. He appeared in all three movies, "", "" and "", which was released on December 10, 2010.

Keynes was born in London. He was the son of Zelfa Hourani and author Randal Keynes. He has an older sister, Soumaya Keynes (born 1989), who also starred in many productions of the BBC Radio 4. His grandparents by his mother’s side were Furugh Afnan and Cecil Fadlo Hourani. Cecil Fadlo Hourani used to be an author and also advisor to Habib Bourguiba, the late Tunisian president. Cecil Hourani was also the brother of Albert Hourani, a historian who studied about the Middle East. The Hourani family were immigrants to England.
On his father’s side, Keynes is the grandson of Richard Keynes, the nephew of the Cambridge professor Simon Keynes, and the great-great-nephew of John Maynard Keynes, an economist. His great-great-great-grandfather was the famous naturalist Charles Darwin, who invented the theory of evolution. Keynes' great-grandparents were Edgar Adroam. 1st Barpm Adoroam and Hester Adrian, Baroness Adrian, both receivers of the Nobel Prize.
Keynes had stated that he is an atheist. Keynes attended the Anna Scher Theatre School from 2000 to 2005. He went to the all-boys City of London School, and took his GCSEs in May and June 2008. He studied biology, chemistry, maths, and history at A-level. In October 2010 he began his degree in Arabic and Middle Eastern History at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He is currently a film critic, writing for "The Citizen", the City of London School weekly school newspaper. He is also a fan of English football club Arsenal.

Keynes lives presently in Highbury, London.

He auditioned for "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" at the same time as he asked for the role of Simon Brown in "Nanny McPhee", but lost the role to Thomas Sangster. His voice got deeper when he was filming "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe", so his sister Soumaya had to voice some of his lines.

Recently, he starred in "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader", the third installment of "The Chronicles of Narnia" film series. The filming began in July 2009, and finished in December of the same year. The film was released on 10 December 2010 in Britain and the US.

Mudrock

Mudrocks are a class of fine grained siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. 

The varying types of mudrocks include: "siltstone", "claystone", "mudstone", "slate", and "shale". 

Most of the particles are less than 0.0625 mm (1/16 mm or 0.0025 inches) and are too small to study readily in the field. At first sight the rock types look quite similar; however, there are important differences in composition and nomenclature. 

There has been a great deal of disagreement involving the classification of mudrocks. There are a few important hurdles to classification, including:

Mudrocks make up fifty percent of the sedimentary rocks in the geologic record, and are easily the most widespread deposits on Earth. 

Fine sediment is the most abundant product of erosion, which is why mudrocks are so common. 

With increased pressure over time the platey clay minerals may become aligned, with the appearance of parallel layering (fissility). This finely bedded material which splits readily into thin layers is called "shale", as distinct from "mudstone". 

From the beginning of civilization, when pottery and mudbricks were made by hand, to now, mudrocks have been important. The first book on mudrocks was not published until 1964. However, scientists, engineers, and oil producers have understood the significance of mudrocks since the discovery of the Burgess Shale and the relatedness of mudrocks and oil.

<doc id="277468" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=277468" title="Claystone">
Claystone

A claystone is a mudrock which does not split easily. 

In order for a rock to be a claystone, it must be up to half (50%) clay, whose particles measure less than 1/256 of a millimeter. 

There are 35 recognized clay mineral species on Earth, they make muds stick together ('cohesive'), or able to flow ('plastic'). 

Clay is by far the smallest particles recognized in mudrocks. Most materials in nature are clay minerals, but quartz, feldspar, iron oxides, and carbonates can weather to sizes of a typical clay mineral.

For a size comparison, a clay-sized particle is 1/1000 of a sand grain. This means a clay particle will travel 1000 times further at constant water velocity, thus requiring quieter conditions for settlement.

The formation of clay is well understood, and can come from soil, volcanic ash, and glaciation. Ancient mudrocks are another source, because they weather and disintegrate easily.

<doc id="277470" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=277470" title="Siltstone">
Siltstone

A siltstone is a mudrock. For a rock to be a siltstone, it must be over fifty percent silt-sized material. 

Silt is any particle smaller than sand, 1/16 of a millimeter, and larger than clay, 1/256 of millimeter. Silt is the product of physical weathering, such as freezing and thawing. Physical weathering does not involve any chemical changes in the rock, just its physical breaking apart. 

One of the highest proportions of silt found on Earth is in the Himalayas, which get rainfall of up to five to ten meters (16 to 33 feet) a year. Quartz and feldspar are the biggest contributors to silt. Silt tends to be non-cohesive, non-plastic, but can liquefy easily.

There is a simple field test to judge whether a rock is a siltstone or not, and that is to put the rock to one's teeth. If the rock feels "gritty" against one's teeth, than it is a siltstone.

A mudstone is a siliciclastic sedimentary rock which has a mixture of silt- and clay-sized particles (at least 1/3 of each).

So, a mudstone is a type of mudrock with a more varied grain size than either siltstones or claystones.

Lactose intolerance

Lactose intolerance is when a person cannot digest milk or milk products (such as cheese or yoghurt). An enzyme called lactase is needed to break down lactose. People with lactose intolerance do not have this enzyme or make only small quantities. Because of this they are unable to digest lactose. 

Up to 75% of people worldwide begin to lose the ability to digest lactose as they grow into adults. This loss of ability ranges from 5% in northern Europe, to over 71% in Sicily and to over 90% in parts of Africa and Asia. There is no cure for lactose intolerance. People need to change their diet to only include food with very little lactose. There are many milk substitutes. 

Milk is not a fermented product. If is not digested, then it may ferment in the small intestine which can cause a problem called pseudoallergy. Amino acids are changed to other substances, which may act in much the same way as histamine in a true allergy.

Lactose intolerance is not the same as milk allergy, which is an immune reaction to some of the proteins in milk.

Normally infant mammals drink their mother's milk. Then the gene which causes the body to make lactase is switched off, and the young move on to adult food. They can no longer digest milk.

Humans are somewhat different from other mammals. Some humans continue to produce lactase, and some do not. It is a type of genetic polymorphism.

The ability to digest lactose into adulthood ('lactase persistence') was useful to humans after the invention of animal husbandry. People kept animals which could provide milk. 

Hunter-gatherer people before the Neolithic revolution were mostly lactose intolerant. So are modern hunter-gatherers. 

A mutation on chromosome 2 stops the shutdown in lactase production. This makes it possible for those with the mutation to continue drinking fresh milk (and eating other dairy products) throughout their lives.

This appears to be a recent adaptation to dairy products. It occurred in both northern Europe and east Africa in people with a historically pastoral lifestyle. Lactase persistence, allowing lactose digestion to continue into adulthood, is a dominant allele, making lactose intolerance a recessive trait. 

Genetic studies suggest that the oldest mutations associated with lactase persistence have only become common in human populations in the last 10,000 years. Because of this, lactase persistence is often given as an example of recent human evolution. As lactase persistence is genetic, but animal husbandry a cultural trait, this is gene–culture coevolution.

Detection probably comes from the fact that they are affected by gravity.

A burn is an injury to a person's skin or even flesh. Burns can grow to be very powerful, and in some cases, can even kill a person. There are 6 degrees of burns. 

Burns are usually minor. They are usually Degree One to a minor Degree Two. Others are more powerful, such as Degree 3. People may get more powerful burns from high heat or radioactive items.

Degree One burns are minor and can be cured at home. They seldom leave scars. A person can get them from hot water, a minor sunburn, or by touching hot metal. It causes pain, but only the top layer of skin is burnt and no nerves are injured. 

Degree Two burns can be cured at home, but some people would prefer to take them to the hospital. This degree of burn goes into the second layer of skin.

Degree Three burns are the most severe burns that most people can survive from. Although they may be severe, the chances of death are very low if treated at the hospital right away. It burns through all three layers of skin, leaving a scab.

This degree of burn goes through the skin and destroys the nerves near it. There is no pain at the 4th degree burn area but there can be immense pain occurs around the burn. Very few have survived it. It must be treated at the hospital ASAP if it occurs and the person is still alive.

This burn degree goes all the way through the skin, the nerves near it, and ends at the muscle.

This degree goes and destroys the core of the body. It burns the skin, nerves, muscles, and scorches the bones. In other words, immediate death can and will happen.

Sexual reassignment surgery (also called gender reassignment surgery, sex reassignment surgery or a sex change) is a surgery for transsexuals on genitals to get the body they want through body modification.

For transsexual women, there is a vaginoplasty after phallectomy and orchidectomy and also breast enriching surgery.

For transsexual men, there is mastectomy and hysterectomy and also phalloplasty in order to make a new penis but this surgery is more difficult and dangerous than vaginoplasty for transsexual women.

Staffordshire Bull Terrier

The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is an English dog breed. It is a medium-sized dog, originally it was bred for dog fighting. It is related to the bull terrier. Its appearance is similar to the American Staffordshire Terrier and American pit bull terrier, but it is smaller than both of them. It grows to a wrist height of 12-17cm, and a weight of about 11-17kg. 

In Great Britain the dog is often kept as a "family dog". Staffordshire Bull Terriers have been trained as search and rescue dogs.

In other countries, such as Germany, this dog breed is seen as problematic; these countries may have put restrictions in place regarding the breeding and keeping such dogs. The people keeping such dogs may need to undergo tests to determine whether they are allowed to keep the dog.

Unconformity

An unconformity is a buried erosion surface separating two rock strata of different ages.

It shows that sediment deposition was broken for a time. 

Usually, the older layer was exposed to erosion for some time before deposition of the younger. However, the term is used to describe any break in the sedimentary record.

Many millions of years may separate the rocks above and below the discontinuity. 

James Hutton found examples of unconformity in Scotland, at Jedburgh in 1787 and at Siccar Point in 1788.

The rocks above an unconformity are younger than the rocks beneath (unless the sequence has been overturned). An unconformity represents time during which no sediments were preserved in the region. 

The local record for that time interval is missing and geologists must use other clues to discover that part of the geologic history of that area. The interval of geologic time not represented is called a "hiatus" (= 'gap').

Harry Mummery

Harold "Mum" Mummery (August 25, 1889 - December 9, 1945) - was a professional ice hockey defenceman, shooting left. He was born in Chicago, IL, and died in Brandon, MB. Mummery played professionally from 1911 until 1923, including six seasons in the National Hockey League for the Toronto Blueshirts, Toronto Arenas, Quebec Bulldogs, Montreal Canadiens and Hamilton Tigers. He was a two-time winner of the Stanley Cup hockey championship.

At the time of his career, Mummery was the largest player ever in the NHA and NHL, playing at 245 pounds in his NHL years and he was known to eat two steaks before hockey games. Mummery appeared in three games as an NHL goaltender in an era when teams did not dress a backup netminder, making him the skater to have played the most games in net. He suited up as a goaltender twice with Quebec and once with Hamilton.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, Mummery moved at an early age to Brandon, Manitoba. He first played senior-level hockey for Brandon YMCA in 1907–08. He moved to Fort William, Ontario to play a season with the Fort William Forts on the Northern Ontario League. He returned to the prairies playing for Brandon and Moose Jaw in minor professional leagues. In 1912, he joined the Quebec Bulldogs, then in the National Hockey Association (NHA). In his rookie season, the Bulldogs, the defending champions, won the NHA and Stanley Cup championships. He played with the Bulldogs until 1916, when he joined the Montreal Canadiens for a season. The Canadiens won the NHA title but lost to the Seattle Metropolitans in the Stanley Cup championship.

Before the beginning of the 1917–18 season, the NHA was suspended and the owners formed the National Hockey League (NHL). The Quebec team did not field a team that year and he was loaned to the Toronto Blueshirts club, now run by the Toronto Arena Company. The club would go on to win the Stanley Cup in a series against Vancouver. After the season the Arena company formed the Toronto Arena Hockey Club and Mummery signed for the 1918–19 season. Unfortunately, the season was a disaster as the club had poor results, weak attendance and it folded, prematurely ending the season. 

In 1919–20, a Quebec team was formed in the NHL, and the NHL assigned former Bulldogs players from the NHA to the team. Mummery was one of those players. When the Quebec team was moved to Hamilton, he was traded before the season to the Canadiens, where he played for the 1920–21 season. He was traded to Hamilton for the 1921-22 season and traded from Hamilton to Saskatoon of the West Coast Hockey League in 1922. He played four games for Saskatoon in 1922–23 and retired.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, United States, the Mummery family moved to Brandon, Manitoba. In 1913, Walter joined the Brandon Wheat Kings of the Manitoba Hockey League. The next season, 1914–15, Walter joined the Quebec Bulldogs of the National Hockey Association (NHA), where he played until the end of the 1916–17 NHA season. The following year, the Quebec club did not operate in the new National Hockey League (NHL) and Mummery was assigned to the Montreal Canadiens. Mummery was loaned to the Montreal Wanderers in December 1917, but did not play a game for the Wanderers either. Before Mummery played a game, the Wanderers arena burned down. Mummery did not play pro hockey until 1919–20, when he joined Edmonton of the Big 4 League for one season. By then, Quebec was operating in the NHL and his rights were assigned to Quebec but he did not return.

James Hutton

James Hutton MD (Edinburgh, (14 June 1726 – 26 March 1797) was a Scottish geologist, physician, naturalist, chemist and experimental farmer. 

Hutton trained in medicine, but never practised it. Instead, he farmed his estate, and did scientific research. He is the founder of modern geology. He saw the Earth as the product of natural forces. What could be seen happening today, over long periods of time, could produce what we see in the rocks.

His theories of geology and geologic time, also called deep time, came to be included in theories which were called plutonism and uniformitarianism. He wrote one of the great books of the 18th century, "Theory of the Earth".

Hutton hit on a variety of ideas to explain the rock strata he saw around him. According to Playfair he "was in no haste to publish his theory; for he was one of those who are much more delighted with the contemplation of truth, than with the praise of having discovered it”. 

After some 25 years of work, his "Theory of the Earth" was read to meetings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1785. 

Hutton later read an abstract of his "Concerning the system of the Earth, its duration and stability" on 4 July 1785, which he had printed and circulated privately. In it, he outlined his theory as follows;

It has been said that the prose of "Principles of Knowledge" was so difficult that it hindered his theories. John Playfair in 1802 restated of Huttton's geological ideas (though not his thoughts on evolution). Charles Lyell in the 1830s popularised the idea of an infinitely repeating cycle (of the erosion of rocks and the building up of sediment). Lyell believed in gradual change, and thought even Hutton gave too much credit to catastrophic changes. 

Lyell's books had widepread influence, not least on the up and coming young geologist Charles Darwin who read them with enthusiasm during his voyage on the "Beagle". William Whewell coined the term uniformitarianism to describe Lyell's version of the ideas. This was in contrast with catastrophism, the idea that the rocks recorded a series of catastrophes followed by repopulation by a new range of species. Over time there was a convergence between these views, but Lyell's description of the development of geological ideas led to a belief that uniformitarianism had triumphed.

Street art

Street art is like impressionism, cubism or pop art an art movement. 

A lot of poor people try to survive by asking a little money in the street. They sometime do the same while making art. These are the "original", "true" street artists. They make music, theatre, temporary paintings on the ground. The other ones are more likely called "urban artist".

A spray can is a artistic tool used by writters on the walls in cities like Philadelphie or New York in 1970. This technique is still used but remain considered more or less as vandalism. One of the most important New York writter wrote SEEN on subways in New York.

The artist Banksy said in december 2010 in a French newspaper called Le Monde (The world) that he has been influenced by the Street art of Paris. For I him it is the mai 1968 mini revolution that started the Street art movement. He also mention Stencil artist called Blek.

Before Street art emerge there was another art movement called Land art. It was before Internet and before the end of USSR. But after the World War 
A couple of "Land artists" called Christo and Jeanne-Claude started making illegal art in the street of Paris in 1962 to protest against the Berlin Wall. In 1972, and 1976 they made Land art in the desert of California, building a very long fence. In 1985, they made a huge Land Art work in Paris. They wrapped the oldest bridge of the city with polyamide fabric. They had to negotiate for years to have the permission of doing it. So it was official but it was controversial. Another artist, Richard Serra, put a big wall made of steel in Chicago. It was official but a lot of people hated it and it was removed after a trial. The work of a steet artist like JR is ephemeral so it does not have the same problem.

After the Berlin wall collapsed, a man called Shepard Fairey started gluing images of a dead french wrestler called André the Giant in California. It was a phenomenon. Fairey opened a web site were he just said it was phenomenology. It was so absurd people could not stop talking about it. Stickers were made of the image of the dead wrestler. It was considered "cool" by some skateboarders. 

In 1999, in Seattle, took place a WTO (World Trade Organisation) summit. There took place big demonstrations. Others summits took place in Prague (2000) and in Genoa (july 2001). The youth that demonstrate during this summit used "Absurd Propaganda", "culture jamming" and other artistic techniques to "reclaim the streets". After the president Georges W. Bush was elected and the 9/11 (september 2001), the absurd propaganda seemed to have a political meaning. So, critics came to the idea to call that phenomenon artivism. Someting part art and part activism.

In 1999, an artist called Space Invader (he took his name from a video game) started putting little mosaic work in Paris. He started by doing it in a museum called the Louvre. French television showed it. Then he started doing it in every city he could. So he met other artists in other cities. Because his work is not ephemeral but very discreet, the authorities let him do. Only in Amsterdam, the city council decided to officially remove them. 
In the same time he opened a web site so people from around the world could relay and participate. He invited Shepard Fairey in Paris in march 2003. Malcolm McLaren who invented punk was there to.

Bit synchronization

Bit synchronization

Synchronization is one of the most important techniques in the digital communication systems nowadays. The problem with bit synchronization is at the
receiver side. The receiver must be able to find the beginning and the end of coming bits(symbols). Then, the receiver can decide where is the middle
of the symbol. This is important to detect data correctly because the rise and fall edge of symbols are distorted. The receiver must also generate the
local synchronized clock. This clock must work at the same frequency as the transmitter clock. This whole process is called the bit synchronization.

Synchronization is a basic problem in digital communications. Synchronization depends on the initial error very much. If the error rate is high, the
synchronization becomes unstable. This means that the performance of the communication system gets worse. The receiver analyzes the incoming signal and
signal-to-noise ratio to make the bit synchronized clock.

There are two basic methods to ensure the bit synchronization - the pilot frequency method and the data-derived method.

The "pilot frequency method" is based on adding an extra signal to the frequency spectrum. This signal is called the pilot frequency. It carries
the information about the frequency(bit rate) of transmitted data. The receiver uses the pilot frequency to make local synchronized clock. This method is not used
very often because it needs extra power to transmit the pilot frequency.
In the "data-derived method", the receiver gets the bit-synchronized clock directly from the received signal. This method has one big advantage. It does
not need any extra energy and any extra frequency spectrum. This is, why this method is used more often than the first one.

Traditional bit synchronization methods have good performance if the signal-to noice ratio(SNR) is high. The performance gets worse when the SNR
becomes lower. the receiver cannot work correctly. In this case, the special synchronization methods must be used.

Simple English Wikipedia is one of the Wikipedia encyclopedias, written in Simple English. Articles in the Simple English Wikipedia use fewer words and easier grammar than the English Wikipedia. The Simple English Wikipedia is also for people with different needs, such as students, children, and adults who quite often find it hard to learn and people who are trying to learn English. Other people use the Simple English Wikipedia because the simple language helps them understand difficult ideas or topics they do not know about.

Wikipedia aims to offer "the sum of all human knowledge" which is legal to copy, change and share, at no cost. We hope you will find huge educational value within this project. Among our thousands of articles, you will find many about all areas of study. No encyclopedia should be the end of research, however, and we hope you'll find our articles useful guides for more study across a whole range of subjects.

The Simple English Wikipedia can be changed by anyone and everyone. Both mistakes and vandalism are problems that the project has to deal with every day. There are a number of safeguards in place. These include encouraging editors to cite , as well as patrolling for vandalism.

This page is intended to help you consider the best way to allow either your children, or children you are responsible for, to use the Simple English Wikipedia safely and enjoyably.

, which means that in relevant areas throughout the site, you will find possibly distressing content and pictures showing subjects like sex in context. Such material is only a very small part of the many articles here. It is possible to — set up Wikipedia to not display images. Editors range widely in both age and cultural background, and as such, there may also some offensive language at times. 

Pages which are normally suitable for children to use may be vandalized with rude words or content which may be offensive. Vandalism is normally noticed and removed within a few minutes, if not seconds (via the function); but sometimes it can remain unnoticed for days, and even if not, someone will have to see it before it can be removed, and this could be anyone.

You may also be interested in another independent project, the — a specific selection of about 5,500 articles from the English Wikipedia, suitable for school children, which has been checked and edited for this audience. It contains about the equivalent content of a 20-volume encyclopedia organized around school curriculum subjects, and is available online and as a free download.

Wikipedia does not have a "working with children" check on editors. It is possible for any editor to communicate with each other either on the wiki, or by email if the editor has an email account registered with Wikipedia. This communication may not be monitored by other Wikipedia editors. We strongly advise all editors not to give out private information such as full contact details. Personal information or contact details can be removed by , a form of extreme deletion that removes material from the database.

Most communication on the Simple English Wikipedia takes place in an open, public, reviewable manner (even personal "talk page" messages can be read by anybody). Note, however, that unlike some sites directed towards youth, Wikipedia does not have staff to patrol discussion pages or remove inappropriate comments. All administrators are volunteers, who may block people breaking rules, but who will not censor conversations, even if they deal with adult topics.

Children and their parents must understand that any person, no matter how well- or ill-motivated, is free to join the project. While some child-focused online communities will remove members who are found/suspected of being dangerous towards children in the "real/offline" world, Wikipedia does not, as a rule, make users reveal their real identities, and cannot remove them according to anything that concerns identity, including criminal or sex-offender records. A child, or anyone else, should never assume that if somebody has an account on Wikipedia, then they're safe to meet in person. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia project, not a social networking web site. Common sense must be used, and in particular it must be remembered that anyone can pass themselves off as anyone on the Internet.

Wikipedia will block the accounts of any users who appear to be using the site for inappropriate purposes, such as trying to form or legitimize relationships with children. For advice on what to do if such behavior is observed, please .

Earthquake performance simulation

Earthquake performance simulation is meant to study effect of earthquakes on building structures and is a practical way of seeing a thing to happen without it actually taking place in the same way. There are research institutions just devoted to earthquake performance simulations, like, e.g., "The George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation" or NEES.

The best way to do it is to put the structure on a shake-table that simulates the seismic loads and watch what may happen next (if you have no time to stand out in the field and wait for a real earthquake to strike, of course). The earliest experiments like this were performed more than a century ago

Another way is to evaluate the earthquake performance analytically. The very first earthquake simulations were performed by statically applying some "horizontal inertia forces", based on scaled peak ground accelerations, to a mathematical model of a building . With the further development of computational technologies, statics approaches began to give way to dynamics ones .

<doc id="277944" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=277944" title="Natron">
Natron

Natron is a natural mixture of sodium carbonate decahydrate (NaCO·10HO, a kind of soda ash) and about 17% sodium bicarbonate (also called nahcolite or baking soda, NaHCO) along with small amounts of household salt (halite, sodium chloride) and sodium sulfate. Natron is white or without color when it is pure. It can be gray or yellow with impurities. Natron deposits are sometimes found in saline (salty) lake beds which arose in arid environments. Throughout history natron has had many practical uses which are still used in the wide range of modern uses of its constituent mineral components.

In modern mineralogy the word "natron" has come to mean only the "sodium carbonate decahydrate" (hydrated soda ash) which makes up most of the historical salt.

The English word "natron" is a French cognate that came from the Spanish "natrón" through Greek νιτρων "nitron", which came from the Ancient Egyptian word "netjeri", meaning natron. The modern chemical symbol for sodium, Na, is an abbreviation of that element's New Latin name "natrium", which came from "natron".

Historical natron was harvested as a salt mixture from dry lake beds in Ancient Egypt and has been used for thousands of years as cleaning. Together with oil, it was an early form of soap. It softens water and removes oil and grease at the same time. Natron was also a cleanser for the teeth and an early mouthwash. The mineral was mixed into early antiseptics for wounds and minor cuts. Natron can be used to dry and preserve fish and meat. It was also an ancient household insecticide, was used for making leather and as a bleach for clothing.

The mineral was used in Egyptian mummification because it absorbs water and was a drying agent. Also, when exposed to moisture the carbonate in natron increases pH, which makes a good environment for bacteria. In some cultures, natron was thought to keep both the living and the dead spiritually safe. Natron was added to castor oil to make a smokeless fuel, which allowed Egyptian artisans to paint artworks inside ancient tombs without staining them with soot.

Natron is an ingredient for making a color called "Egyptian blue". It was used with sand and lime in ceramic and glass-making by the Romans and others at least until 640 CE. The mineral was also used as a flux to solder precious metals together.

Most of natron's uses both in the home and by industry were replaced in time with closely related sodium compounds and minerals. Natron's detergent properties are now commercially supplied by soda ash, the mixture's chief compound ingredient, along with other chemicals. Soda ash also replaced natron in glass-making. Some of its ancient household roles are also now filled by ordinary baking soda, natron's other meaningful ingredient.

Natron is also the mineralogical name for the compound sodium carbonate decahydrate (NaCO·10HO), which is the main component in historical natron. Sodium carbonate decahydrate has a specific gravity of 1.42 to 1.47 and a Mohs hardness of 1. It crystallizes in the monoclinic-domatic crystal system, typically forming efflorescences and encrustations.

The term "hydrated sodium carbonate" is commonly used to encompass the monohydrate (NaCO·HO), the decahydrate and the heptahydrate (NaCO·7HO), but is often used in industry to refer to the decahydrate only. Both the hepta- and the decahydrate effloresce (lose water) in dry air and are partially transformed into the monohydrate thermonatrite NaCO·HO.

Sodium carbonate decahydrate stays the same at room temperature, but it changes into the crystal material NaCO·7HO, then above to sodium carbonate monohydrate, NaCO·HO, if the temperature becomes . This releases a mostly clear, colorless salty kind of water with a little solid thermonatrite. The mineral natron is often found in association with other minerals such as gypsum and calcite.
Most human-made sodium carbonate is soda ash, sodium carbonate anhydrate NaCO, which is obtained by calcination (dry heating at temperatures of 150 to 200°C) of sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate monohydrate, or trona.

Jan Parandowski

Jan Parandowski (May 11, 1895 – September 26, 1978) was a Polish writer, essayist, and translator. He is best known for his works relating to classical antiquity, he was also the president of the Polish PEN Club between 1933 and 1978, with a break during World War II.

He was born in Lwów, Austria-Hungary and died in Warsaw.

Jan Parandowski graduated from Jan Długosz High School, in Lwów, Austria-Hungary. In 1913 he began studying about philosophy at the University of Lwów. There he also studied classical philology, archeology, art history, and Polish literature. However, he had to stop studying because of the World War I, and instead taught at schools in Voronezh and Saratov. From 1920 he was able to continue studying again, and in 1923 received his Master's degree in classical philology and archeology.

From 1922 to 1924 he was the literary chief for publisher Alfred Altenberg. He organized a series of translations of classical works and a further "great writers" series. Between 1924 and 1926 he travelled to Greece, France, and Italy. From 1929 he lived in Warsaw, where at first he was an editor for the monthly, "Warsaw Diary". In 1930 he became a member of the Polish PEN Club, and in 1933, he became its president.

At the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, he received a bronze medal for his book, "The Olympic Discus", and in 1937 he received the Polish Literary Academy's "Gold Laurels" for outstanding literary achievement. Between 1937 and 1938 he was an editor for the state publishing house for school books, and produced the educational series, "Great People". After World War II began, he participated in the cultural underground. The flames of the Warsaw uprising consumed his literary archives and his entire unpublished works.

During the years 1945 - 1950 he took over the Department of Classical Antiquity, then the Department of Comparative Literature at the Catholic University of Lublin (KUL). He became a regular member of Warszawskiego Towarzystwa Naukowego (Warsaw Association of Sciences), worked with publications such as the "Universal Weekly", "Meander", "Creation", and renewed his activities as chairman of the Polish PEN Club. In 1948 he organized a World Congress of Intellectuals in Wrocław, after which he went back to live in Warsaw. 

In 1958, Jan Parandowski organized an International Translators Convention in Warsaw, and in 1962 he became the vice-president of International PEN. In 1964 he received the Polish State Award of the First Degree, and in the same year he was a signatory to the "List of 34" scholars and writers in defense of freedom of speech. In 1975 he was honored for his lifetime achievement by Radio Free Europe. In 1976 he received an honorary doctorate in Christian Philosophy from the Catholic University of Lublin (KUL).

In 1988 a prize was founded in his honour, the Jan Parandowski prize, and is awarded annually by the Polish PEN Club to exemplary historical writers.

As a literary figure, Parandowski began writing in Lwow in 1913, though he came to experience international prominence after his much cited "Mythology" in 1924. His knowledge, crisp and engaging writing style, and ability to tackle the most controversial subjects contributed greatly to Parandowski's popularity. In Poland his works have become a staple of classical study in schools of all levels.

Together with they researched the way a cell is able to use glycogen for which they were given the 1947 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, together with Argentine physiologist Bernardo Houssay. 

They discovered the mechanism by which glycogen—a derivative of glucose—is broken down in muscle tissue into lactic acid. It is then resynthesized in the body, and stored as source of energy (this is known as the Cori cycle). They also identified the important catalyzing compound, the Cori ester. In 2004, their work was designated an ACS National Historical Chemical Landmark for carbohydrate metabolism.

Perciformes

The Perciformes is the largest order of vertebrates. They have about 40% of all bony fish. 

"Perciformes" means "perch-like". They belong to the class of ray-finned fish and have over 7,000 species in almost all aquatic environments.

They have the widest range of sizes of any order of vertebrates, ranging from the 7 mm "Schindleria brevipinguis" to the 5 metre "Makaira" species. They first appeared and diversified in the Upper Cretaceous.

Some well-known members of this group are angelfish, barracuda, bass, blenny, cichlids, damselfish, filefish, goby, grouper, remora, swordfish, mackerel, pufferfish, tilefish, tuna, whiting, and of course perch.

The dorsal and anal fins are divided into front spiny and back soft-rayed portions, which may be partially or completely separated. 

The pelvic fins usually have one spine and up to five soft rays, positioned unusually far forward under the chin or under the belly. Scales are usually ctenoid (rough-edged). 

They are grouped as in the text "Fishes of the World". The order is probably polyphyletic, and changes may occur in this and other teleost orders.

Recent morphological and DNA sequence analysis has shown that several of the higher-level groupings of teleosts are evolutionary grades rather than clades. Examples of demonstrably paraphyletic groups include the Perciformes.

Negative film

Negative film is the name for a photographic film that will give images which have their colors inverted, after development. This inversion means that the complementary color is used. A second process (usually called "making a print") is used to obtain any number of "photos", which can also be in different sizes. The other kind of film is called reversal film, where development results in exactly one "positive" image (which does not use complementary colors). 

Negative films that use colors have multiple layers. Each layer is sensitive to a different wavelength of light. 

Most amateur films in use today are negative films. 

The benefits of this kind of film is that it is very tolerant to exposure differences, without noticeable loss in quality. Another benefit is that getting the film developed is very easy.

Air navigation

Air navigation is special kind of general navigation. It is used by pilots in aircraft to know their exact position. That is very important. Because if they get lost, they can for example fly into some dangerous area or hit the mountain. There are generally two types of air navigation depending on weather. When there is a good weather outside, pilots navigate themselves visually with map. But when the weather is bad and they do not see the ground, they use the special radio navigational instruments, radar or the air traffic controller navigates them. First kind of navigation is called VFR (visual flight rules) navigation. The second is IFR (instrument flight rules) navigation. Also we cannot forget the effect of wind on the aircraft in the air. 

 When the pilot flies VFR flight, he uses his map, compass and he looks on the ground. During the preparation for a flight he chooses big visible points on the map, for example large cities, lakes, hills, rivers, roads or forests. Then when he is in the air, he seeks the chosen points to make sure he is on a good way. The weather must be good enough to let the pilot see the ground. He also cannot fly into clouds, because he can get lost. Pilots also have to look for the other aircraft. It is their responsibility to make sure they do not get too close to other aircraft.

 During IFR flight, pilots cannot fly wherever they want. They have to fly only on specified routes. Also the aircraft must have many special devices working with radio waves, GPS or radar. The air routes lead mostly from radio beacon to beacon. Pilot must set the correct frequency of the beacon and fly to it. GPS helps to find exact position of airplane. Each aircraft have special code that is indicated on air traffic controller’s radar screen. Because pilot does not see outside, he has to do what the controller says. And the controller makes sure that the aircraft does not crash. 

 The wind is a great problem in navigation. Imagine that pilot sets the plane to fly eastwards (90°). If the wind blows from the north, it will blow the plane to the south. And the aircraft will fly to south-east (135°). So, to fly exactly to the east, pilot must set the plane to north-east. This was just an example. In reality, wind can blow from any direction and at any speed. So pilots must also watch the wind and know how to compensate the effect of the wind on the aircraft.

The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe

The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a 2005 fantasy adventure movie directed by Andrew Adamson and based on "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe", the first published book in C. S. Lewis's children's series, "The Chronicles of Narnia". It was co-produced by Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures. William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes play Peter, Susan, Lucy and Edmund, the four British children that had to go to the countryside during the Blitz, and there they find a wardrobe that leads to the fantasy world of Narnia. There they join the Lion Aslan against the forces of Jadis, the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).

The movie was released on December 9, 2005, in both Europe and North America and was highly successful at the box office. It won the 2005 Academy Award for Best Make Up and various other awards and is the first movie in the series of movies based on the books. It was the best selling DVD in North America in 2006 taking in $332.7 million that year.

During the 1940 bombing of Finchley, London, the Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, run away to the country home of Professor Digory Kirke, their relative.

While they are playing hide-and-seek, Lucy finds a wardrobe that leads to a world called Narnia, where it is always winter. She spends a few hours in the home of the faun, Mr. Tumnus, who tells her about Jadis, the White Witch, and how she cursed Narnia into being only winter for one hundred years. If they ever met a human, they had to bring them to her. However, Tumnus likes Lucy and does not want to kidnap her, so he instead takes her safely back home. When she returns, hardly any time has passed in the normal world, and when the other children check the Wardrobe, it does not lead to "Narnia".

A few days later, Edmund follows Lucy into the wardrobe, meeting the White Witch and her dwarf Ginarrbrik. She offers him Turkish Delight and asks Edmund to bring his brother and sisters to her castle, so that he can become her heir and the rest will serve him. Edmund agrees, and she leaves, just as Lucy meets Edmund. They return together, and Lucy tells Peter and Susan about how she went to Narnia again (this time with Edmund), but Edmund denies it. The Professor talks with Peter and Susan, and he tells them that Lucy's story might be telling the truth.

While running away from the housekeeper after accidentally breaking a window, the four siblings hide in the wardrobe and enter Narnia. They find out that Mr. Tumnus has already been taken by the Witch's secret police, and meet Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who tell them about Aslan. They say that Aslan is on the move to take back Narnia from the Witch. The four must help Aslan, for there was a prophecy that if two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve sit in the four thrones, the White Witch would no longer be able to reign.

Edmund sneaks off to visit the Witch while they are at the Beaver's house. When he goes to her castle, she is angry that he came alone and without his siblings. The Witch sends wolves to find the children and the beavers, who barely escape. Edmund meets Tumnus while being chained in the Witch's dungeon. The Witch demands that Edmund reveal where his siblings are because the wolves could not find them, and Edmund hesitates before telling her. The Witch then turns Tumnus into stone and begins searching for the other children herself.

While Peter, Lucy, Susan and the beavers go to the Stone Table, they see what they think is the White Witch chasing after them, so they hide. It is actually Father Christmas, one of the signs that the Witch is getting weaker. Father Christmas gives Lucy a bottle of cordial that will cure any sickness and a dagger to defend herself with, Susan a bow and arrows and a magical horn, and Peter a sword and shield.

Pursued by wolves led by Maugrim, the group crosses a river. When they come to Aslan's camp, they meet Aslan, who is a huge and noble lion. Aslan promises to help Edmund in any way he can. Later, two wolves ambush Lucy and Susan while they are playing in the river. Then Peter comes and kills Maugrim with his sword, and some of the troops of Aslan follow the other wolf to the witch's camp and rescue Edmund.

The White Witch goes to Aslan's camp and tries to take back Edmund, but Aslan says he will sacrifice himself instead. That night, as Lucy and Susan secretly watch, Aslan is killed by the White Witch at the Stone Table. In the morning he is resurrected because "there is a magic deeper still the Witch does not know". Aslan takes Susan and Lucy to the Witch's castle, where he turns the stone prisoners back to real life.

Edmund persuades Peter to battle with the Witch. Peter's army begins losing, and to stop the witch from turning others to stone, Edmund destroys the Witch's wand and gets stabbed while he does so. Then, as the Witch fights Peter, Aslan comes and kills her with his roar. The Pevensies become Kings and Queens, staying in Narnia until they are adults. 

Fifteen years later they find the wardrobe and return to England, becoming children again. The professor enters the room and asks what they were doing. Peter replies, "You wouldn't believe us if we told you, sir." The professor tosses him the ball that broke the window and replies, "Try me." Lucy later goes to the wardrobe because she wants to return to Narnia, but the Professor tells her he has been trying for years, and that the wardrobe will probably not work again.


The radio-announcer that Peter listens to near the beginning of the movie is played by Douglas Gresham, co-producer of the movie and C. S. Lewis's stepson. Keynes' voice broke during filming, so some of his voice track had to be voiced again by his sister Soumaya. Mr. Pevensie is only glimpsed in a photo which Edmund tries to retrieve during the bombing, which is of Sim-Evan Jones' father.

With the exception of Tilda Swinton, who was the first choice to play Jadis, the White Witch, casting took a long time. Beginning in 2002, Adamson went through 2500 audition tapes and met 1800 children before coming down to the final four actors for the Pevensies. Moseley and Popplewell came from the very start of casting, whilst Henley and Keynes were rather late. Moseley quit school to learn all his lines and beat 3000 boys to the role of Peter.

Brian Cox was originally supposed to voice Aslan on December 9, 2004, but Adamson changed his mind.

IMMAGINE&amp;POESIA

IMMAGINE&POESIA is an international contemporary art movement that links images to the written word. 

It was founded at "Alfa Teatro", Torino, Italy in 2007, by a small group of poets and artists including Aeronwy Thomas, Dylan Thomas's daughter, Lidia Chiarelli, Gianpiero Actis and others, who believe that the power of the written word and the power of visual image, when joined, create a new work which is not only greater than the parts, but changed and magnified by the union.

The American poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti and the Italian artist Ugo Nespolo are members of IMMAGINE&POESIA’s Honorary Committee. Beverly Matherne, poet and a professor at the Northern Michigan University, is also a member of the movement. The official art critics of the movement are Mary Gorgy and Enzo Papa.
Since its inception, IMMAGINE&POESIA has continued to grow. Hundreds of poets and artists from all over the world have participated, and the movement now reaches international audiences through the web, through international art exhibitions, and through a series of broadsides published by "Cross Cultural Communications" in New York. Works from the several of the poets and artists of IMMAGINE&POESIA were presented at the "International Poetry Festival" in Swansea, Wales in June 2011.
The official song of the Movement is "Until the stars fall" by "Gavin Adam Wood", singer and songwriter from Cambridge, United Kingdom.

The Manifesto has been translated into 28 languages.

It consists of 10 points. The fourth point suggests "moments of cross fertilization" for artists and poets: a painter can inspire a poet or a poetic composition may inspire the creation of an art work, the result is a new and complete form of art.
Since 2007 the Movement has organized poetry readings and exhibitions where images and words are closely connected. The most important have been in Italy, in the U.K. and in the U.S.A.

Feria del Sol (Mérida)

Feria Del Sol (), or Carnaval Taurino de America (), is an international cultural festival held in the city of Mérida every February of the year. The Feria festival is held alongside the carnival feast. The festival includes bull competitions, cultural expositions, commercial and zootechnic expositions, concerts, parades, sports, and a voting competition for "La Reina Del Sol" ().

In the city of Mérida; celebrates a more ancient interest of Venezuela, but in the City of the Knight, which did not celebrate fairs similar to the cities of San Cristóbal, Barquisimeto, Maracaibo, Táriba. Therefore, a group of amateurs had the idea to build a Plaza de Toros, so that Mérida had a taurine calendar and was added to the most important fairs of the country, which already had a peak imponente in all the national territories. At the beginning the fairs, who was set up the first days of December, had the function of celebrate the day of the "Immaculate Conception", therefore the people set the date of the fairs on 9 December and 10 December. For the bullfighting, César Faraco, Manuel Benítez "El Cordobés", Francisco Rivera "Paquirri", Julio Aparicio, Curro Girón, Paco Camino and the mounted bullfighter, Juan Cañedo, who is of Mexican origin, and fought bulls of Félix Rodríguez, "Achury Vejo" and "Ambaló" who all originated in the country of Colombia.

For the first run, heavy rainfall prevented the inauguration, which resulted in two runs, which had to be held on the second day: one in the morning hours and the other during the afternoon, which was, the first time this had happened in a same square, in the same day in Venezuela. Previously in Caracas, which celebrated two runs in the same day, but in two different squares, in the "Circo Metropolitano" and the "Nuevo Circo", but in the same square, during the same day, which also, was the first time that this had happened.

In 1968, the fair was not celebrated, but a bullfighting occurred on 13 April 1968 in coincidence of the Holy Saturday. Was fought a stupendous closing of "Dosgutiérrez" and acted Alfredo Leal, Curro Girón and Pepe Cáceres. Then, decided celebrate the fairs so that they coincided with the carnivals under the name of "Feria del Sol" and like this was as in 1969 celebrated the first fair with three run of bulls the days 15, 16 and 17 February of said year. The first poster was composed by bulls of "Valparaíso" for Alfredo Leal, Daniel "Matatoba" Santiago, Manuel Benítez "El Cordobés" and the Venezuelan Lucio Requena. The first ear of the fair was for Alfredo Leal.

At the end, the fair has transformed into one of the most important fairs of Venezuela and, also, the taurine world. Regarding the fair of the "Immaculate" which, has celebrated in these years, 1990, 1991, and 1997 but with very little acceptance.

Extratropical cyclones

An extratropical cyclone is a weather system of low pressure. It is a huge whirling wind which turns anticlockwise in the Northern Hemisphere. The shape is circular or oval. The usual size in diameter is about 1000 km. They originate in latitudes 30° – 60° from the equator. We can call also them mid-latitude cyclones.

These cyclones are usually connected with fronts. A front is a system of changes in weather. It is caused by a very cold air mass meeting a very hot air mass. In the cyclone, there is a system of warm and cold front. 

The closer we come to the centre of a cyclone, the cloudier it is. There is also a very high chance of precipitation. The wind is strong and changes its direction, as the warm front passes. The weather is stable and fog is usual. As the cold front passes, there is a change of wind, the temperature decreases and rain is also common. 

Cyclonal defects usually occur in series. We call them "the families of the cyclones". Usually, there is a belt of 3 or 4 cyclones in different stages. The cyclone has several stages of evolution. First, there is a stage of the origin of a cyclone. Second stage means that the cyclone is strengthening. At that moment, both the warm and cold front are very large. The system is moving very fast. The cold front is generally faster, which means that it runs down the warm one. This causes an occluded front. The weather is similar to both types of fronts. The third stage ends with filling of the area with air. The pressure rises. Stage four means that the signs of cyclonal weather disappear.

Grameen Foundation Australia

Grameen Foundation Australia (GFA) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in Sydney (Australia) create to support the poverty alleviation work and mission of the Grameen Bank, Grameen Trust and their affiliate organisations by giving access to the poorest people to microfinance and as a result of access to these services, move themselves out of poverty. 
"The poor themselves can create a poverty-free world … all we have to do is to free them from the chains that we have put around them." -Muhammad Yunus

Grameen Foundation Australia (“GFA”) takes its inspiration from the poverty alleviation work done by Professor Muhammad Yunus and his colleagues at Grameen Bank in Bangladesh.

In 2006, Prof. Yunus and Grameen Bank were awarded the Nobel peace prize for “their efforts to create economic and social development from below”. According to the Norwegian Nobel Committee “…Every single individual on earth has both the potential and the right to live a decent life. Across cultures and civilizations, Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that even the poorest of the poor can work to bring about their own development”.

GFA’s predecessor in Australia, the Grameen Bank Support Group, was started by 10 co-founders (including the current CEO of GFA, Shan Ali) in Sydney in 1994. The purpose of this group was to promote the work and vision of Grameen Bank amongst the Australian public, media and policy makers. 

Between 1994 and 1998 the Support Group engaged with the Grameen Bank in a number of ways. The most fruitful instances of this engagement were:


During Prof. Yunus’ visit to Sydney in 1998 to receive the Sydney Peace Prize, he met with members of the Grameen Bank Support Group and their pro-bono lawyer David Ford, and gave detailed guidance on setting up GFA. Whilst there are no formal protocols in place for a country to establish a Grameen Foundation, this personal imprimatur from Prof. Yunus became the mandate underpinning the existence of GFA. In 1999 the Grameen Bank Support Group was disbanded in Australia and replaced by the newly incorporated GFA.
In the first 5 years of GFA’s existence GFA carried out AusAID projects in East Timor, Nepal, Vietnam, the Philippines and Bangladesh. In the last few years GFA has been heavily involved in poverty alleviation in the Philippines (see below).

In 1994, a similar foundation, Grameen Foundation USA (“GFUSA”) was started in the United States by Alex Counts (www.grameenfoundation.org). 

N.B: It is important to recognize that there are no formal relationships between the various members of the “Grameen Family”, namely Grameen Bank and Grameen Trust in Bangladesh, GFA in Australia and GFUSA in the United States. However, there is a strong informal association between these organizations. They draw upon each others expertise when required and they are all inspired by Prof. Yunus’ philosophy of alleviating poverty through driving scalable efficiencies in service delivery to the poor and supporting the skills and entrepreneurship of the poor.

The mission of GFA is to see poor people, especially the poorest and those living in harder to reach areas, to extract themselves from poverty trough micro finance, and lead lives of respect, dignity and opportunity for the long-term. GFA works for empowerment of targeted populations, not dependence (non paternalist organization).

Rather than provides funds and technical assistance to local and regional microfinance organizations directly administering microfinance programs, GFA directly administers microfinance programs.
The Current GFA Projects are :
1. Poverty alleviation in Northern Samar, the Philippines (see separate presentation)
2. Poverty alleviation in the Manila Slums (trial project) (see separate presentation)
3. Scoping work (early stages) in the State of Andhra Pradesh in India 
4. Scoping work (early stages) in East Timor 

Every action made by GFA follows the core principles that the foundation impose to herself and which are:
§ A holistic approach to assisting development in a targeted region (i.e. not just micro-finance)
§ Effective use of partnerships (e.g. Rotary clubs, Farm Africa, local governments) which can bring particular skills, resources and local knowledge to help maximise project outcomes 
§ Hard work, efficiency, innovation, cost-effectiveness
§ Honesty, transparency, accountability 
§ Constant improvement in the way that we operate
§ Maximizing the organization's leverage at all times so that we can have the maximum substantive effect on helping poor people in poor developing countries.
§ Empowerment of targeted populations, not welfare and dependence
§ Remain secular and respectful to others’ values and beliefs.

All India Muslim League

The All-India Muslim League was a political party in British India. It was founded at Dacca (now Dhaka, Bangladesh), in the Bengal Presidency, in 1906. The party played an important role during the 1940s in the Indian independence movement. It developed into the driving force behind the creation of Pakistan as a Muslim state on the Indian subcontinent. After the independence of India and Pakistan, the League continued as a minor party in India, especially in Kerala, where it is often in government within a coalition with others. In Pakistan, the League formed the country's first government, but disintegrated during the 1950s after an army coup. One or more factions of the Muslim League have been in power in most of the civilian governments of Pakistan since 1947. In Bangladesh, the party was revived in 1976 and won 14 seats in 1979 parliamentary election. Its importants has decreased since then, it is no longer significant in the political landscape of the country, in 2011.

Islamic studies is a term that can mean two different things.

"Islamic studies" can mean researching or learning any topic in a way that agrees with Islamic knowledge. It includes all the traditional forms of religious thought, such as Kalam (Islamic theology) and Fiqh (Islamic law). It also looks at areas of study that look at secular topics from an Islamic understanding. For example, Islamic science and Islamic economics.

"Islamic studies" can also mean studying the history of Islam and Islamic philosophy. Academics from many different disciplines (areas of study) study and share knowledge on Muslim societies as it is today and as it has been in the past. Some non-Muslim scholars have written works which are read by many Muslims. Before 1980, such non-Muslim scholars in this field had been called "Islamicists". The field of study was often a part of Oriental studies It is now more often said to be a part of Asian studies. Many universities have degrees on the subject of Islamic studies.

Liquid scintillation counting

Liquid scintillation counting

Liquid scintillation counting is an analytical technique. It is used to measure radiation from beta (alpha) - emitting nuclides. It can also detect the auger electrons emitted from Chromium-51 (Cr) and Iodine-125 (I) samples. Samples of nuclides are dissolved or suspended in a "cocktail". The "cocktail" is containing an aromatic solvent and small amounts of other additives known as fluors. Beta (alpha) particles emitted from the sample transfer energy to the solvent molecules. The molecules in turn transfer their energy to the fluors. The excited fluor molecules dissipate the energy by emitting light. Scintillation cocktails often contain additives that shift the wavelength of the emitted light. It makes it more easily detected. 

The samples are placed in small transparent (often glass or plastic) vials. They are loaded into a liquid scintillation counter. The counter has two photomultiplier tubes. They are connected in a coincidence circuit. The coincidence circuit assures that genuine light pulses are counted. 
Counting efficiencies under ideal conditions is about 30% for tritium. Tritium is a low-energy beta emitter. It is nearly 100% for phosphorus-32 (P). Phosporus is a high-energy beta emitter. Some chemical compounds and highly colored samples can interfere with the counting process. This interference is known as "quenching". It can be overcome through data correction or through careful sample preparation. P can also be counted in a scintillation counter without the cocktail. This technique is known as Cherenkov counting. It relies on the Cherenkov radiation being detected directly by the photomultiplier tubes. Cherenkov counting in this experimental context is normally used for quick rough measurements.

Iran Air is an airline based in Iran. It is the flag carrier of Iran, and is owned by the government of Iran.

The airline was started in 1944, and was called the Iranian Airways Company. In 1946, the airline made its first flight. It started by flying only to places in Iran, but soon started flights to other countries. It started by flying Douglas DC-3 airplanes. Later, it bought other types of airplanes. By the late 1950s, Iran Air was moving 80,000 people each year.

In 1961, because the government ordered it, Iran Air combined with another Iranian airline, Persian Air Services. This combined company was owned by the government and called United Iranian Airlines, but it changed its name to Iranian National Airlines. The new airline carried about 142,000 people a year, and by the late 1960s carried 403,000 people.

In the early 1970s, the airline bought five Boeing 747s. After the Islamic Revolution, Iran Air was not allowed to buy planes from the United States, but it still bought planes from Airbus. By the mid 2000s, though, the airline was not able to get enough parts to keep its planes flying, and had to stop flying some of them.

During the early 2000s, Iran Air carried about six million people a year, and an airline it owned, Iran Air Tours, carried two million people. Iran Air had 9,000 people working for it, and made about $407.44 million.

Iran Air has the following types of aircraft in its fleet, as of September 2009:

<doc id="278320" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=278320" title="Edmund Pevensie">
Edmund Pevensie

Edmund, or "Ed" Pevensie, is a fictional character in C. S. Lewis's "Chronicles of Narnia". He comes out in three of the seven books ("The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe", "Prince Caspian", and "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"), and a smaller character in two other books ("The Horse and His Boy", and "The Last Battle").

In the live-action films, "", "" and "", Edmund is portrayed by actor Skandar Keynes. Actor Mark Wells portrays an older Edmund at the end of the first film.

In "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe", he betrays his siblings to Jadis, the White Witch while under her influence, but as the story goes on he accepts that he has done wrong. In the book, Edmund is described as having ash blonde hair, grey eyes and dimples like his siblings. He is the only one out of brother and sisters to have light hair which as Lewis states represents him being an outsider.

In "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe", Edmund is one of the main characters, at the age of 10 years old, and the character who develops the most over the story.

It is said in the book that Edmund started his life as a likeable person, but then changed for the worse and began to act meanly after moving into a new school. However, in the 2005 film adaptation of the book, it is said that he is upset that they are sent away from home, on account of their father forced to serve the war.

Edmund talks cruely to Lucy when she first finds the entrance to Narnia through a wardrobe, and is the second of the Pevensie children to go to Narnia, after following Lucy so he could tease her. While there, he meets Jadis, the White Witch (who introduces herself as the Queen of Narnia) and he gets to eat some magical Turkish delight, which causes an addiction in the person who eats it. After that, he promises the White Witch that he will bring his brother and sisters to her castle, not knowing that she was intending to kill them all to prove a Narnian prophecy. Lucy did mention the White Witch in a conversation and Edmund realizes that the witch was none other than the "Queen of Narnia", but the magic of the Turkish Delight was so strong that he decided to go to the castle for more.

When Edmund returns to the normal world, he refuses having been in Narnia, not wanting to admit that Lucy was speaking the truth.

When the four of the Pevensie children later go through the wardrobe he says that he has been in Narnia before. He and the other siblings are protected by Mr and Mrs Beaver. But when the Beavers and the other three Pevensie children are having a conversation about the arrival of Aslan, Edmund sneaks away to the White Witch's castle, where he hopes to be made a prince and later on a king.

However, his thoughts of the Witch changes when she berates him for coming without his siblings, and even more so when on their journey to the Stone Table they find a small group of creatures enjoying a feast made by Father Christmas. When the creatures continue to say that Father Christmas is their benefactor and has entered Narnia, a sign that her power is weakening, she turns them to stone.

Edmund now finds to his horror that the White Witch was evil, and would give anything to be with his brother and sisters. The White Witch's sledge eventually stops as the snow melts (another sign of the witch's crumbling power), so they have to continue their journey on foot. They stop in a wooded valley, where the Witch prepares to kill Edmund, on account of his betraying her. She ties Edmund to a tree and takes out a dagger, but a rescue party sent by Aslan arrives, frees him and brings him to his siblings and the rest of Aslan's troop. Edmund becomes fully sorry after a long talk with Aslan who afterward commands the Pevensies to agree the matter of their brother's misdeeds forgotten. The next day, the Witch claims that Edmund's life is hers. She and Aslan work out an agreement that Aslan will die in Edmund's place (though the other Narnians do not know this), but unknown to her, the magical nature of this agreement allows Aslan to be brought back to life. Susan and Lucy witnessed Aslan's resurrection.

While Aslan and Lucy and Susan race to free the stone prisoners in the Witch's castle, Edmund joins Peter's army in the battle, where he plays a role in breaking the White Witch's dangerous wand, and is wounded in the attempt. Then the Witch's army outnumbered very quickly, and she is soon killed by Aslan, while the leftover of the enemies either give themselves up or take to flight.

However, Edmund is saved from death by the arrival of Aslan, and of Lucy, who gives Edmund a few dropse of a magic cordial which can quickly heal any sickness.

Eventually, Edmund heals is crowned to the Great Western Wood by Aslan as King Edmund the Just, co-ruler of Narnia with Queen Lucy, Queen Susan and High King Peter, and is knighted as Duke of Lantern Waste, Count of the Western March, and Knight of the Noble Order of the Table.

15 years later, he and his siblings return to England, where they all appear as children again.

Edmund and his siblings return to Narnia to meet Caspian, rightful King of Narnia, against King Miraz. He convinces Trumpkin the dwarf that they are the Kings and Queens from the legend by defeating him in a sword-fighting practice. Later, he helps Peter and Trumpkin defend Caspian against Nikabrik (the black dwarf), the hag, and the were-wolf. Edmund is also there to see Peter's sword duel against King Miraz.

Edmund has since become more caring for Lucy, and is the first one to believe her when she "sees" Aslan, going on her side against the disbelief comments of Trumpkin and her other siblings. Edmund is shown in the book more nicer than in "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe".

In the movie, Edmund proves to be much more mature than Peter and Caspian both, but he stays out of their arguments. Also in the movie, he is able to stop the White Witch from being brought back from the dead by crashing the ice wall she is slipping out of.

Edmund, Lucy and their cousin Eustace come back to Narnia again by a painting, and end up in the ocean. They are saved and brought on board the Dawn Treader by King Caspia who is on a journey to find the three Lords that disappeared. This was Edmund and Lucy's last adventure in Narnia, because Aslan told them they were getting too old to come back. By this point Edmund had matured a great deal which can be seen in the way he deals with Eustace (cousin) and in the fights with King Caspian. Also, Edmund has completely stopped insulting Lucy. When Eustace (cousin) changes his behavior after being changed back from a dragon, Edmund mentions his own betrayal and says that Eustace was not worse than he was with the words "You are an ass, but I was a traitor".

King Edmund, Queen Susan and Mr. Tumnus the Faun are visitors in the country of Calormen, where Prince Rabadash wants Susan to marry him. Thinking that Shasta is the missing Prince Corin of Archenland, Narnia's ally, Edmund scolds the boy for running off and making everybody worried sick of him. The Narnians escape, thanks to Tumnus' cloever plan, which leads Rabadash to make his father agree that they should take Narnia by invading Archenland.

Shasta meets Edmund once again in Anvard. Edmund reminds Shasta that he should not eavesdrop. Edmund and King Lune of Archenland lead the fight against the Calormene army and they manage to win.

After dreaming of King Tirian in Narnia begging for their help in England, Peter and Edmund go to the Ketterleys' old home in London to dig up the magic rings that Professor Kirke buried in the yard as a boy in "The Magician's Nephew" to be used by Eustace and Jill to reach Narnia. They are waiting for the others on the train platform when an accident happens.

When King Tirian sees the Seven Friends of Narnia in his dream, he thinks that Edmund and Peter 'had already the face of a King and a warrior'.

Edmund joins everyone, except Susan, into Aslan's country. Like his Peter and Lucy, he is killed in the train crash and goes back to Aslan's country, where they can all live forever in a peaceful way.

"When the [[Pawn [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] hits the [[fight|conflicts]] he thinks like a [[King (chess)|king]]<br>
What he knows throws the blows when he goes to the fight<br>
And he'll win the whole thing 'fore he enters the ring<br>
There's no body to batter when your mind is your might<br>
So when you go solo, you hold your own hand<br>
And remember that depth is the greatest of heights<br>
And if you know where you stand, then you know where to land<br>
And if you fall it won't matter, cause you'll know that you're right"

The Sea of Monsters

The Sea of Monsters is a fantasy-adventure novel based on Greek mythology. It was written by Rick Riordan and published in 2006. It is the second novel in the "Percy Jackson & the Olympians" series and is the sequel to "The Lightning Thief". This book is about the adventures of thirteen-year-old demigod Percy Jackson. It describes how he and his friends rescue his satyr friend Grover from the Cyclops Polyphemus. They also save Camp Half-Blood, a summer camp for demigods, from the attack of a Titan's attack. They bring the Golden Fleece from Polyphemus' island which cures Thalia's poisoned pine tree, that protected the camp.

"The Sea of Monsters" received good reviews and was nominated for many awards such as the 2006 Book Sense Top Ten Summer Pick and the 2009 Mark Twain Award. It sold over 100,000 copies in paperback. It was released as an audiobook on September 6, 2006. "The Sea of Monsters" is followed by "The Titan's Curse", which is the third book of the five in the series.

Like the first book, "The Lightning Thief", this novel is of the fantasy genre. Reviewers have called it a "fast paced" book with humor and action, which discusses acceptance and family love.

Percy Jackson is a 13 year-old demigod. He is playing dodgeball against large seventh graders. He discovers they are Laistrygonians (a kind of monster in Greek mythology). They try to kill Percy with explosive fireballs. He is protected by Tyson, a friend. The Laistrygonians' fireballs do nothing to Tyson, which surprises Percy. Annabeth rescues Percy and takes Percy and Tyson to Camp Half-Blood. They find the camp is under attack. This is because Thalia's tree, which protects the camp, has been poisoned by an unknown intruder. Chiron, the activities director, has been sacked. This is because he is suspected to have poisoned the tree. He is replaced by Tantalus, a spirit from the Fields of Punishment.

Percy finds out that Tyson is a Cyclops. Poseidon claims Tyson as his son, making him Percy's half-brother. Annabeth and Percy ask Tantalus to send somebody on to find the Golden Fleece (the wool of a golden-haired sheep in Greek mythology). Tantalus sends Clarisse, the daughter of the god of war, Ares, to get the Fleece. Poseidon gives Percy and his friends three Hippocampi. Together with Annabeth and Tyson, Percy find a cruise ship called the "Princess Andromeda". They discover it is owned by Luke. They are captured by Luke in the ship. There, they learn that Luke is trying to reform Kronos. Kronos is an evil Titan lord. They manage to escape from the ship. 

Later, they are saved by Clarisse. Clarisse was traveling on her own boat. Her father, Ares, had given her the boat as a gift. The boat is destroyed when they enter the Sea of Monsters. The book says that mortals know the Sea of Monsters as the Bermuda Triangle.

Along the way, they land at the island of Circe, a magician. She changes Percy into a guinea pig. Annabeth saves Percy and they manage to leave in a ship. They pass the land of the Sirens. Annabeth knows that the Sirens tell a person of their innermost wishes. She tells Percy that she wants to listen to the Sirens' songs. So, she asks Percy to tie her to the mast of the ship. But, Percy forgets to remove her knife. So, she manages to free herself. She almost manages to reach the land. However, Percy saves her. This way, he learns what that the Sirens' song made Annabeth see. The monsters showed her parents together again and Luke having become good. They are all having a picnic, in a new Manhattan, built by Annabeth. From the Sirens' song, Annabeth understands that her fatal fault is hubris (arrogance or too much pride).

After this, they reach the island of Polyphemus. Tyson and Clarisse help them save Grover. They also get back the Fleece. Annabeth is injured in the island. But the Fleece helps her to become better. They return to Florida on the hippocampi. Percy sends Clarisse back to camp with the Fleece. Then, Luke captures Percy, Annabeth, Grover and Tyson. Percy manages to contact camp with an Iris-message. In this way, he tricks Luke into saying he poisoned Thalia's tree. Luke almost kills Percy in a fight. Chiron and his relatives, the Party Ponies, save Percy and the others. Chiron becomes the activities director again as everyone knows he is not guilty. The Fleece cures Thalia's tree of its poison. It even makes Thalia live again.


"The Sea of Monsters" received mostly positive reviews. Reviewers praised the plot, the themes and the author's style of writing. "Publishers Weekly" in their review said the book was better than its prequel, "The Lightning Thief". "School Library Journal" praised the novel's plot and its characters. They said that Percy was an appealing character and said readers would like the "chilling prophecy" which was a part of the plot. "Child" magazine also praised the style of the book. They said it was similar to "The Lightning Thief", and added that the series would get many new readers. "Children's Literature" said the writing was "extraordinary" and added, "...[t]his book, sequel to "The Lightning Thief", is an amazing mixture of mythology and young adult fiction." Matt Berman, of Common Sense Media, praised the book, saying "The Percy Jackson series continues to be pure fun, with the author doing nearly everything right to produce a book that few kids will be able to resist." Norah Piehl of Kidsreads.com also gave a positive review. She praised the book's style and said it was similar to the previous book in the series It sold over 100,000 copies in hardcover by the time paperback copies were released in April 2007.

However, "Kirkus" was not positive about the book, saying that "it's doubtful Percy wouldn't guess Tyson's otherworldly connection (his connection with the world of Greek gods) immediately after the dodgeball game [...] some of the humor will zip over the heads of the target audience" However, they praised the style of the novel, particularly the way in which Percy makes humorous comments.


On September 6, 2006, a seven hour and 54 minute audiobook version of "The Sea of Monsters", read by actor Jesse Bernstein was published worldwide by Listening Library. Bernstein had also narrated "The Lightning Thief"s audiobook,

"AudioFile" magazine praised the audiobook. They said that the "[...]action-packed book (second in a series) will delight fans of Percy Jackson, the half-blood son of Poseidon, as Percy once again battles mythical monsters in modern-day settings while on his mission to save the tree that guards Camp Half-Blood." They also praised Bernstein, saying "[n]arrator Jesse Berns helps listeners slip right into the oddly engaging world that Riordan creates, in which contemporary (modern) teen characters and those from classical mythology intermingle (get mixed)." They mentioned that he could successfully portray teenagers, while keeping the pace fast. This allowed to enjoy the book's humor. The magazine "Publishers Weekly" praised Bernstein's "snappy (quick) delivery and all the right funny touches" that made the "action-packed fantasy such fun."

After the movie "" was somewhat successful, a film of "The Sea of Monsters" was planned. This was reported in early 2011. In fall 2011, it was confirmed that 20th Century Fox will release the film on March 27, 2013.

The novel was followed by "The Titan's Curse", released on May 1, 2007. In "The Titan's Curse", Percy, Grover, Annabeth and Thalia go to a school to recruit two powerful demigods. Like the earlier two books in the series, this book was well received. Reviewers praised its humorous style and the plot of the story.

Huntingdon College, founded in 1854, is a liberal arts college in Montgomery, Alabama, United States. It is known for its business and science programs. The college has recently made a football team and marching band.

Huntingdon College was first started on February 2, 1854, as "Tuskegee Female College". A decision was made in the late 19th century to move the campus to a larger city. The college, renamed the "Woman's College of Alabama" moved in 1910 to a 58 acre section of Montgomery. Several new buildings were built for the "Gothic" style of the main college building, Flowers Memorial Hall.

The college admitted its first male student in 1934 and changed its name the next year to Huntingdon College in honor of Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, a person who supported Methodism

Huntingdon is ranked a fourth school by "U.S. News and World Report". Huntingdon College is also ranked by the "Princeton Review" as one of the best liberal arts colleges in the Southeast.

<doc id="278535" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=278535" title="Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein">
Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein

Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, KG, GCB, DSO, PC (; 17 November 1887 – 24 March 1976), often referred to as "Monty", was a British Army officer. He fought in World War I, and during World War II he successfully commanded Allied forces at the Battle of El Alamein, a major turning point in the Western Desert Campaign. He was later an important commander in Italy and in North-West Europe, where he was in command of all Allied ground forces during Operation Overlord until after the Battle of Normandy, and was the principal commander for Operation Market Garden . After the War he became Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces of Occupation in Germany and then Chief of the Imperial General Staff.

Montgomery was born in Kennington, London, in 1887. He was the fourth child of nine. His parents were The Reverend Henry Hutchinson Montgomery, an Anglo-Irish Anglican priest, and Maud Montgomery (née Farrar). Henry Montgomery was the second son of the noted British Indian Empire official, Sir Robert Montgomery, who died a month after Bernard's birth. Bernard's mother Maud was the daughter of the well-known preacher Frederic William Farrar, and was eighteen years younger than her husband. After the death of Sir Robert Montgomery, Henry inherited the Montgomery ancestral estate of New Park at Moville, a town on the Inishowen Peninsula of north County Donegal in the west of Ulster.

However, there was still £13,000 to pay on the mortgage, a large amount of money in the 1880s, and Henry was at the time still only a parish priest. Despite selling off farms at Ballynally, "there was barely enough to keep up New Park and pay for the summer holiday" (i.e., at New Park). It was lucky that in 1889 Henry was made Bishop of Tasmania, then still a colony. He thought he had to spend as much time as possible in rural Tasmania and was away six months at a time. While he was away his wife, still in her mid-twenties, gave her children "constant" beatings, or ignored them most of the time as she carried out the public duties of the bishop's wife. Of Bernard's brothers and sisters, Sibyl would die when she was very young in Tasmania, and Harold, Donald and Una would all emigrate. When her husband was absent, Maud Montgomery took little active interest in the education of her young children. She had them taught by tutors brought across from England. The loveless environment made Bernard something of a bully, as he himself later recalled "I was a dreadful little boy. I don't suppose anybody would put up with my sort of behaviour these days."
Later in life Montgomery refused to allow his son David to have anything to do with his grandmother and he refused to attend her funeral in 1949.

The family returned home once for the Lambeth Conference in 1897, and Bernard and his brother Harold were educated for a term at The King's School, Canterbury. In 1901, Bishop Montgomery became secretary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and the family returned to London. Montgomery went to St Paul's School and then the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, from which he was almost expelled for setting fire to a fellow cadet during a fight with pokers. On graduation he joined the 1st Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment in September 1908 as a second lieutenant, first seeing service in India until 1913. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1910.

The First World War began in August 1914 and Montgomery moved to France with his regiment that month. Half his battalion was destroyed during the retreat from Mons. At Méteren, on 13 October 1914, during an Allied counter-offensive, he was shot through the right lung by a sniper and was so badly injured that a grave was dug because he was expected to die.

A Platoon sergeant came to assist him but was killed. He fell on Montgomery. The German sniper fired at him until sunset. The body of the sergeant protected Montgomery and took most of the enemy fire. Montgomery was hit once more though, in the knee. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for gallant leadership. The citation for this award, published in the "London Gazette" in December 1914 reads: 

In early 1915, he was appointed to be brigade major training Kitchener's New Army and returned to the Western Front in early 1916 as an operations staff officer during the battles of the Somme, Arras, and Passchendaele. During this time he came under IX Corps, part of General Sir Herbert Plumer's Second Army. Because the infantry, artillery and engineers were trained together, rehearsed together, and worked together they were able to do what they were asked efficiently and without unnecessary casualties.

Montgomery served at the battles of the Lys and Chemin-des-Dames before finishing the war as General Staff Officer 1 and effectively chief of staff of the 47th (2nd London) Division, with the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel. A photograph from October 1918 shows the then unknown Lt.-Col. Montgomery standing in front of Winston Churchill (Minister of Munitions) at the victory parade at Lille.

Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939. The 3rd Division was sent to Belgium as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). Montgomery predicted a disaster similar to that in 1914, and so spent the Phoney War training his troops to retreat safely rather than offensive operations. During this time, Montgomery faced serious trouble from his superiors for his attitude regarding the sexual health of his soldiers. However, he was defended from dismissal by his superior Alan Brooke, commander of II Corps. Montgomery's training paid off when the Germans began their invasion of the Low Countries on 10 May 1940 and the 3rd Division advanced to the River Dijle and then withdrew to Dunkirk with great professionalism, returning to Britain intact with minimal casualties. During Operation Dynamo — the evacuation of 330,000 BEF and French troops to Britain — Montgomery had assumed command of the II Corps after Brooke had taken acting command of the whole BEF.

On his return Montgomery annoyed the War Office by criticising the way the BEF was run and he was put in charge of a smaller group of soldiers. He was however made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. In July 1940, he was appointed acting lieutenant-general, placed in command of V Corps, responsible for the defence of Hampshire and Dorset, and started a long-running feud with the new commander-in-chief, Southern Command, Claude Auchinleck. In April 1941, he became commander of XII Corps responsible for the defence of Kent. During this period he instituted a regime of continuous training and insisted on high levels of physical fitness for both officers and other ranks. He was ruthless in sacking officers he considered would be unfit for command in action. In December 1941 Montgomery was given command of South-Eastern Command overseeing the defence of Kent, Sussex and Surrey. He renamed his command the South-Eastern Army to promote offensive spirit. During this time he further developed and rehearsed his ideas and trained his soldiers, culminating in Exercise Tiger in May 1942, a combined forces exercise involving 100,000 troops.

In 1942, a new field commander was needed in the Middle East. Auchinleck was acting as both the commander-in-chief Middle East Command and commander Eighth Army. He had fixed the Allied position at the First Battle of El Alamein, but after a visit in August 1942, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, replaced him as C-in-C with Alexander and William Gott as commander of the Eighth Army in the Western Desert. After Gott was killed flying back to Cairo Churchill was persuaded by Brooke, who by this time was Chief of the Imperial General Staff to appoint Montgomery, who had only just been nominated to replace Alexander as commander of the British ground forces for Operation Torch.

Montgomery was very popular with the men of the Eighth Army, and when he took command Army's fighting spirit and abilities got better. Taking command on 13 August 1942, he immediately became a whirlwind of activity. He ordered the creation of the X Corps, which contained all armoured divisions to fight alongside his XXX Corps which was all infantry divisions. This was in no way similar to a German Panzer Corps. One of Rommel's Panzer Corps combined infantry, armour and artillery units under one division commander. The only common commander for Montgomery's all infantry and all armour corps was the Eighth Army Commander himself. Correlli Barnett said that Montgomery's solution "...was in every way opposite to Auchinleck's and in every way wrong, for it carried the existing dangerous separatism still further." Montgomery spent two months making the long front line at El Alamein stronger. He asked Alexander to send him two new British divisions (51st Highland and 44th) that were then arriving in Egypt and were scheduled to be deployed in defence of the Nile Delta. He moved his field HQ to Burg al Arab, close to the Air Force command post in order better to coordinate combined operations. Montgomery wanted the Army, Navy and Air Force to fight together from the same detailed plan. He ordered immediate reinforcement of the vital heights of Alam Halfa, just behind his own lines, expecting the German commander, Erwin Rommel, to attack with there, something that Rommel soon did. Montgomery ordered all plans for retreat be destroyed. "I have cancelled the plan for withdrawal", he told his officers at the first meeting he held with them in the desert. "If we are attacked, then there will be no retreat. If we cannot stay here alive, then we will stay here dead."

Montgomery made a great effort to appear before troops as often as possible, frequently visiting various units and making himself known to the men, often arranging for cigarettes to be distributed. Although he still wore a standard British officer's cap on arrival in the desert, he briefly wore an Australian broad-brimmed hat before switching to wearing the black beret (with the badge of the Royal Tank Regiment next to the British General Officer's badge) for which he became notable. The black beret had been given to him by a soldier when he climbing into a tank to get a closer look at the front lines. Both Brooke and Alexander were astonished by the change in atmosphere when they visited on 19 August, less than a week after Montgomery had taken command.

Rommel attempted to turn the left side of the Eighth Army at the Battle of Alam Halfa from 31 August 1942. The German/Italian armoured Corps infantry attack was stopped in very heavy fighting. Rommel's forces had to withdraw quickly so that they could escape though the British minefields be cut off. Montgomery was criticised for not counter-attacking the retreating forces immediately, but he felt strongly that his build-up of British forces was not yet ready. A hasty counter-attack risked ruining his strategy for an offensive on his own terms in late October, planning for which had begun soon after he took command. He was confirmed in the permanent rank of lieutenant-general in mid October.

The conquest of Libya was essential for airfields to support Malta and to threaten the rear of Axis forces opposing Operation Torch. Montgomery prepared meticulously for the new offensive after convincing Churchill that the time was not being wasted. (Churchill sent a telegram to Alexander on 23 September 1942 which began, "We are in your hands and of course a victorious battle makes amends for much delay.) He was determined not to fight until he thought there had been enough preparation for a victory, and put into action his beliefs with the gathering of resources, detailed planning, the training of troops — especially in clearing minefields and fighting at night — and in the use of 252 of the latest American-built Sherman tanks, 90 M7 Priest self-propelled howitzers, and making a personal visit to every unit involved in the offensive. By the time the offensive was ready in late October, Eighth Army had 231,000 men on its ration strength including British, Australian, South African, Indian, New Zealand, Greek and Free French units.

The Second Battle of El Alamein began on 23 October 1942, and ended twelve days later with the first large-scale, decisive Allied land victory of the war. Montgomery correctly predicted both the length of the battle and the number of casualties (13,500). However, soon after British armoured units and infantry broke through the German and Italian lines and were pursuing the enemy forces at speed along the coast road, a violent rainstorm burst over the region, bogging down the tanks and support trucks in the desert mud. Montgomery, standing before his officers at headquarters and close to tears, announced that he was forced to call off the pursuit. Corelli Barnett has pointed out that the rain also fell on the Germans, and that the weather is therefore an inadequate explanation for the failure to exploit the breakthrough, but nevertheless the Battle of El Alamein had been a great success. Over 30,000 prisoners were taken including the German second in command, General von Thoma, as well as eight other general officers. Rommel, having been in a hospital in Germany at the start of the battle, was forced to return on 25 October 1942 after General Stumme - his replacement as German commander - died of a heart attack in the early hours of the battle.

Montgomery was knighted and promoted to full general. The Eighth Army's later advance as the Germans retreated hundreds of miles towards their bases in Tunisia used the logistical as well as the firepower advantages of the British Army while avoiding unnecessary risks. It also gave the Allies an indication that the tide of war had genuinely turned in North Africa . Montgomery kept the initiative, applying superior strength when it suited him, forcing Rommel out of each successive defensive position. On 6 March 1943, Rommel's attack on the over-extended Eighth Army at Medenine (Operation Capri) with the largest concentration of German armour in North Africa was successfully repulsed. At the Mareth Line, 20 March to 27 March, when Montgomery encountered stronger opposition than he had expected, he switched to trying to move around the side of the Germans, backed by low-flying RAF fighter-bomber support.

This campaign demonstrated the battle-winning ingredients of morale (sickness and absenteeism were virtually eliminated in the Eighth Army), co-operation of all arms including the air forces, first-class logistical back-up and clear-cut orders. For his role in North Africa he was awarded the Legion of Merit by the United States government in the rank of Chief Commander.

The next major Allied attack was the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). Montgomery considered the initial plans for the Allied invasion, which had been agreed in principle by Eisenhower and Alexander, to be unworkable because of the way troops and effort were separated. He managed to have the plans changed to concentrate the Allied forces, having Patton's Seventh US Army land in the Gulf of Gela (on the left side of Eighth Army, which landed around Syracuse in the south-east of Sicily) rather than near Palermo in the west and north of Sicily. Inter-Allied tensions grew as the American commanders Patton and Bradley (then commanding II US Corps under Patton), got annoyed because they saw Montgomery as boastful. They resented him, while accepting his skills as a general.

During the autumn of 1943, Montgomery continued to command the Eighth Army during the landings on the mainland of Italy itself. In conjunction with the Anglo-American landings at Salerno (near Naples) by Mark Clark's Fifth Army and seaborne landings by British paratroops in the heel of Italy (including the key port of Taranto, where they disembarked without resistance directly into the port), Montgomery led the Eighth Army up the toe of Italy. Some criticism was made of the slowness of Montgomery's advance. The Eighth Army, responsible for the eastern side of the Allied front, from the central Apennine mountain spine to the Adriatic coast, fought a succession of engagements alternating between opposed crossings of the rivers running across their line of advance and attacks against the cleverly constructed defensive positions the Germans had fashioned on the ridges in between. The Eighth Army crossed the Sangro river in mid-November and penetrated the German's strongest position at the Gustav Line but as the winter weather deteriorated the advance ground to a halt as transport bogged down and air support operations became impossible. Montgomery hated the lack of coordination, the dispersion of effort, and the strategic muddle and opportunism he perceived in the Allied effort in Italy and was glad to leave the "dog's breakfast" on 23 December.

Montgomery returned to Britain to take command of the 21st Army Group which consisted of all Allied ground forces that would take part in Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy. Preliminary planning for the invasion had been taking place for two years, most recently by COSSAC staff (Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander). 

Montgomery's initial plan was, most likely, for an immediate breakout toward Caen. He did not have enough men at first, so started a series of battle in which the British, Canadian and American armies trapped and defeated the German forces in Normandy in the Falaise pocket. By the middle of July the Cotentin Peninsula was occupied and Caen captured..

The increasing number of American troops in the European theatre (from five out of ten divisions at D-Day to 72 out of 85 in 1945) made it a political impossibility for the Ground Forces Commander to be British. After the end of the Normandy campaign, General Eisenhower himself took over Ground Forces Command while continuing as Supreme Commander, with Montgomery continuing to command the 21st Army Group, now consisting mainly of British and Canadian units. Montgomery bitterly resented this change, although it had been agreed before the D-Day invasion. Winston Churchill had Montgomery promoted to Field Marshal by way of compensation. 

Montgomery was able to persuade Eisenhower to adopt his strategy of a single thrust to the Ruhr with Operation Market Garden in September 1944. It was uncharacteristic of Montgomery's battles: the offensive was strategically bold, but poorly planned. Montgomery either did not receive or ignored ULTRA intelligence which warned of the presence of German armoured units near the site of the attack. As a result, the operation failed with the destruction of the British 1st Airborne Division at the Battle of Arnhem and the loss of any hopes of invading Germany by the end of 1944.

Montgomery's preoccupation with the push to the Ruhr had also distracted him from the essential task of clearing the Scheldt during the capture of Antwerp; and so, after Arnhem, Montgomery's group was instructed to concentrate on doing this so that the port of Antwerp could be opened.

When the surprise attack on the Ardennes took place on 16 December 1944, starting the Battle of the Bulge, the front of the U.S. 12th Army Group was split, with the bulk of the U.S. First Army being on the northern shoulder of the German 'bulge'. The Army Group commander, General Omar Bradley, was located south of the penetration at Luxembourg and command of the U.S. First Army became problematic. Montgomery was the nearest commander on the ground and on 20 December, Eisenhower (who was in Versailles) transferred Courtney Hodges' U.S. First Army and William Simpson's U.S. Ninth Army to his 21st Army Group, despite Bradley's vehement objections on national grounds. Montgomery grasped the situation quickly, visiting all divisional, corps, and army field commanders himself and instituting his 'Phantom' network of liaison officers. He grouped the British XXX Corps as a strategic reserve behind the Meuse and reorganised the US defence of the northern shoulder, shortening and strengthening the line and ordering the evacuation of St Vith. The German commander of the 5th Panzer Army, Hasso von Manteuffel said:

Eisenhower had then wanted Montgomery to go on the offensive on 1 January to meet Patton's army that had started advancing from the south on 19 December and in doing so, trap the Germans. However, Montgomery refused to commit infantry he considered underprepared into a snowstorm and for a strategically unimportant piece of land. He did not launch the attack until 3 January, by which point the German forces had been able to escape. A large part of American military opinion thought that he should not have held back, though it was characteristic of him to use drawn-out preparations for his attack. After the battle the U.S. First Army was restored to the 12th Army Group; the U.S. Ninth Army remained under 21st Army Group until it crossed the Rhine. 

Montgomery's 21st Army Group advanced to the Rhine with operations Veritable and Grenade in February 1945. A carefully-planned Rhine crossing occurred on 24 March. While successful it was weeks after the Americans had unexpectedly captured the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen and crossed the river. Montgomery's river crossing was followed by the encirclement of the German Army Group B in the Ruhr. Initially Montgomery's role was to guard the flank of the American advance. This was altered, however, to forestall any chance of a Red Army advance into Denmark, and the 21st Army Group occupied Hamburg and Rostock and sealed off the Danish peninsula.

On 4 May 1945, on Lüneburg Heath, Montgomery accepted the surrender of German forces in northern Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands. This was done plainly in a tent without any ceremony. In the same year he was awarded the Order of the Elephant, the highest order in Denmark.

After the war Montgomery became the C-in-C of the British Forces of Occupation and the British member of the Allied Control Council. He was made 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein in 1946. He was Chief of the Imperial General Staff from 1946 until 1948, succeeding Alanbrooke, but was largely a failure as it required strategic and political skills he did not have. He rarely spoke with his fellow commanders-in-chiefs, and sent his deputy to their meetings. He clashed particularly with Arthur Tedder, who as Deputy Supreme Commander had wanted Montgomery sacked during the Battle of Normandy, and who was by now Chief of the Air Staff. When Montgomery's term of office expired, Prime Minister Clement Attlee appointed General (later Field-Marshal) William Slim as his successor; when Montgomery protested that he had already promised the job to his protegé General Crocker, a former corps commander from the 1944-5 campaign, Attlee is said to have given the memorable retort "Untell him".

Montgomery then became Chairman of the Western European Union's commanders-in-chief committee. Volume 3 of Nigel Hamilton's "Life of Montgomery of Alamein" gives a good account of the bickering between Montgomery and his land forces chief, a French general, which created splits through the Union headquarters. He was thus pleased to become Eisenhower's deputy in creating the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's European forces in 1951. He was an effective inspector-general and mounted good exercises, but out of his depth politically, and his exacting manner and emphasis on efficiency created ill-feeling. He continued to serve under Eisenhower's successors, Matthew Ridgway and Al Gruenther, until his retirement, aged nearly 71, in 1958. His mother died in 1949; Montgomery did not attend the funeral, claiming he was "too busy". He was chairman of the governing body of St John's School, Leatherhead, Surrey from 1951 to 1966 and a generous supporter. Montgomery was an Honorary Member of the Winkle Club, a noted charity in Hastings, East Sussex, and introduced Winston Churchill to the club in 1955.

In 1953, the Hamilton Board of Education in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, wrote to Montgomery and asked permission to name a new school in the city's east end after him. Viscount Montgomery Elementary was billed as "the most modern school in North America" and the largest single-storey school in Hamilton, when the sod was turned on 14 March 1951. The school officially opened on 18 April 1953, with Montgomery in attendance among almost 10,000 well-wishers. At the opening, he gave the motto "Gardez Bien" from his own family's coat of arms.

Montgomery referred to the school as his "beloved school" and visited on five separate occasions, the last being in 1960. On his last visit, he said to "his" students:
Before retirement, Montgomery's outspoken views on some subjects, such as race, were often officially suppressed. After retirement these outspoken views became public and his reputation suffered. He supported apartheid and Chinese communism under Mao Zedong, and spoke against the legalisation of homosexuality in the United Kingdom, arguing that the "Sexual Offences Act 1967" was a "charter for buggery" and that "this sort of thing may be tolerated by the French, but we're British — thank God." However, several of Montgomery's biographers, including Chalfont (who found something "disturbingly equivocal" in "his relations with boys and young men" ) and Nigel Hamilton (2002) have suggested that he may himself have been a repressed homosexual; in the late 1940s he conducted an affectionate friendship with a 12-year-old Swiss boy.

Montgomery's memoirs (1958) criticised many of his wartime comrades in harsh terms, including Eisenhower, whom he accused, among other things, of prolonging the war by a year through poor leadership — allegations which ended their friendship, not least as Eisenhower was still US President at the time. He was stripped of his honorary citizenship of Montgomery, Alabama, and was challenged to a duel by an Italian officer. He was threatened with legal action by Field-Marshal Auchinleck for suggesting that Auchinleck had intended to retreat from the Alamein position if attacked again, and had to give a radio broadcast (20 November 1958) expressing his gratitude to Auchinleck for having stabilised the front at the First Battle of Alamein. The 1960 edition of his memoirs contains a publisher's note (opposite page 15) drawing attention to that broadcast, and stating that in the publisher's view the reader might assume from Montgomery's text that Auchinleck had been planning to retreat and pointing out that this was in fact not the case. 

Montgomery was never raised to an earldom like other wartime commanders Harold Alexander, Louis Mountbatten and even Archibald Wavell, but unlike them he had never been a Theatre Supreme Commander or held high political office. An official task he insisted on performing in his later years was bearing the Sword of State during the State Opening of Parliament. His increasing frailty, however, raised concerns about his ability to stand for long periods while carrying the heavy weapon. Ultimately, those fears were borne out when he collapsed in mid-ceremony in 1968 and did not perform this function again.

Generation Y is made up of people born in and after 1976-or the early 1980s and afterward-until the early or mid 1990s, according to various sources. People in this generation period are known as Millennials or Echo Boomers. The famous people born during this period include Katie Holmes, Sarah Michelle Geller, Colbie Caillat and Britney Spears. The Generation Y period is known as the Echo Boom generation because of the high birth rate during this period. The high birth rate almost matches that of the Baby Boom period after World War II.

Hornblende

Hornblende is a complex series of silicate minerals. 

Hornblende is not a recognized mineral in its own right, but the name is used as a general or field term, to refer to a dark amphibole. 

It is an isomorphous mixture of three molecules; a calcium-iron-magnesium silicate, an aluminium-iron-magnesium silicate, and an iron-magnesium silicate. 

Hornblende has a hardness of 5–6, a specific gravity of 2.9–3.4 and is typically an opaque green, greenish-brown, brown or black color. It is most often confused with the minerals augite and biotite mica, both of which are black and can be found in granite.

Hornblende is a common constituent of many igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite, diorite, gabbro, basalt, andesite, gneiss, and schist. It is the principal mineral of amphibolites. 

Very dark brown to black hornblendes that contain titanium may be called basaltic hornblende, from the fact that they are usually a constituent of basalt and related rocks. 

The word hornblende is derived from the German "horn" and "blenden", to 'blind' or 'dazzle'. The term "blende" is often used to refer to a brilliant non-metallic luster, for example, zincblende and pitchblende, the ore of uranium.

Echidna (mythology)

Echidna (Greek: from “Snake”) is a monster of Greek mythology, half woman, half serpent. Her parents were either the sea deities Phorcys and Ceto (according to Hesiod’s Theogony) or Tartarus and Gaia (in the account of the mythographer Apollodorus); in Hesiod, Tartarus and Gaia are the parents of Echidna’s husband, Typhon. Among Echidna’s progeny by the 100-headed Typhon, were Ladon (the dragon who protected the Golden Apples of the Hesperides), another dragon who protected the Golden Fleece, the Hydra, the goatlike Chimera, and the infernal hounds Orthus and Cerberus. The Sphinx and the Nemean lion, both sired by Orthus, were also among her offspring.

Ultrarelativistic limit

Particles which go near the speed of light are called ultrarelativistic.

The ultrarelativistic limit is the maximum velocity that a particle can move at. Albert Einstein found the equation for energy: E=mc². This means that energy is equal to a certain amount of mass. However, this is a simplified version of his equation. The longer version of his equation is E=mc+pc. (Mathematically, if you ignore the pc and take the square root of the equation, you get E=mc). pc refers to the velocity of a particle multiplied by a very large number. 

Einstein then went on to show that a particle can never achieve the speed of light, because you get a divide by zero error from the equation for kinetic energy, formula_1.
Look at the denominator (bottom) of the equation, formula_2. "v" refers to the velocity of the particle. If its velocity reaches the speed of light (which is "c" in this equation), formula_3 will equal one, and since that would leave one minus one in the denominator, there would be a divide by zero error.

Particles which go below the speed of light (all particles which have mass) are called tardyons. Theoretical particles which go above the speed of light are called tachyons.

<doc id="278579" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=278579" title="Atmospheric circulation">
Atmospheric circulation

Atmospheric circulation

The atmospheric circulation is a large-scale movement of masses of air. The origin of these processes is the sun radiation. The sun waves radiate the short-wave radiation. The earth absorbs only a part of this energy. The other part is radiated back to the atmosphere and to the universe. The back radiation is long-waved. The thermal energy is distributed thanks to the circulation of the air on the surface of the earth. 
The demonstration of circulation varies from year to year, but the basic climatologic structure is almost constant. We recognize 3 cells: The Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell and the Polar cell. The movement of air masses is influenced by Coriolis Force. It means that the air diverts to the west.

"The Hadley cell"

The earth and ocean are intensively radiated in the equatorial areas. The hot and usually moist air rises. It is called convection. This process creates a low pressure area along the equator. The area is also called the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The hot air goes to both south and north and gets colder. As the air is cold enough, it goes down to the surface again. This creates and semi-deserts. The masses of air from the 30 degrees go back to the equator. 

"The Pollar cell"

The air on 60 degrees of latitude is colder and drier than the air on the equator. On the other hand, the rising movements are still possible. The character of processes is similar to the Hadley cell. The warmer air goes up, and falls down on the poles. This air comes back to the equator. 

"The Ferrell cell"

The movements between 30 and 60 degrees are more compounds. The temperature is not the main reason of this circulation. The air in this cell moves according to the differences between moving masses in Hadley and Polar cells. The interchange of high and low areas is typical.

Firestar's Quest (Warriors)

All seems well in the land of the four Clans. Firestar, the leader of ThunderClan, is proud that the Clans are at peace and thriving. But his dreams are being haunted by wailing cats, fleeing some terrible disaster. With some help from an old kittypet friend he discovers a shocking secret: StarClan, his ancient ancestors, have lied to him. Now he faces a hard decision. Can he really abandon his Clan in search of a dark secret, hidden from memory? With Sandstorm at his side he foes on a perilous journey to recover a missing Clan. Nothing will ever be the same again.

As it is a "Warriors" book, it is written by Erin Hunter.

At first it takes place at the New Forest. Soon, it's a journey.

The story begins with Firestar out in the forest. He gets caught by his own apprentice, Bramblepaw. The next day he becomes a warrior, Brambleclaw. Meanwhile, Firestar's dreams become disturbed by wailing cats, and he eventually goes to the Moonstone, looking for answers. He finds out that the cats are SkyClan cats, the lost Clan from many moons ago. There, he has a discussion with his closest friends, who are his deputy, Graystripe, his medicine cat, Cinderpelt, and his mate, Sandstorm. They decide that Firestar must go. He picks up Sandstorm on his way out of the camp, and heads off along the river.

He now goes along through a storm, and loses Sandstorm. Because of that, he stays a few days in the nearby village to look for her. One he finds her, the pair continue, and find the end of the stream. There, they seek out the last descendant of SkyClan, and talk to him. They are then given their mission: Rebuild SkyClan before it is gone forever. They find many cats, join them up if they choose, and teach them about the ways of the Clans. 

They pick up more and more cats, and eventually, the newly rebuilt SkyClan along with Firestar and his mate fight a gigantic swarm of rats. There, their mission is complete. The first SkyClan's enemies are gone, SkyClan is rebuilt, and the modern SkyClan is now the fifth Clan. There are six Clans once again. ThunderClan, RiverClan, ShadowClan, WindClan, SkyClan, and StarClan are once again all the Clans in history.

The end shows Sandstorm and Firestar with their two kits, Leafkit, named for Leafstar, leader of SkyClan, and Squirrelkit, named for her bushy tail.

Monitor lizard

Monitor lizards, also known as biawak or goannas, genus Varanus, are members of the family Varanidae. They are, as the name says, lizards. They have a distinctive upper set of teeth to intimidate their predators when in danger. "Varanus" is a group of largely carnivorous lizards which includes the largest living lizard, the Komodo dragon, and the crocodile monitor. The closest living relatives are the anguid and helodermatid lizards.

Monitor lizards are usually large reptiles, although some can be as small as 12 centimeters in length. They have long necks, powerful tails and claws, and well-developed limbs. Most species are terrestrial, but arboreal and semi-aquatic monitors are also known.

Musado

The musado is a modern martial art which is divided into two branches: the traditional musado destined for civil persons and the Musado MCS ("Military Combat System") destined for the army and the police. The term "musado" (from Korean language) means "the way of warrior". Nevertheless, the musado is a German martial art, based on the Korean arts.

The international centre of the musado is localized in Dortmund.
The grand master of the musado is Herbert Grudzenski from Germany, the main instructors for the Czech Republic are Oldřich Šelenberk and Antonín Sokol.

The traditional musado derives from Korean traditional martial arts.

The beginning of the musado is dated as from 1968.

The traditional musado has 6 levels (1.-6. "kup") of student which are marked by colour (see the table). Differently from the majority of the martial arts the student does not have a belt since the beginning. Only to the term of the course which lasts 2-4 months there is capacity to pass examination for the white belt.
The belts go up until ninth "dan", "dan" is marked on the belt with Roman numeration written with golden letters. In the Czech Republic, the most graduated is Antonín Sokol (4. "dan").

The code of honour is a modern version of the code of ancient Korean units Hwarang.
After taking oath the student must adhere to these moral and ethical principles ("kyohun"; Korean terms):

The Musado MCS is a military system of personal defence and of body-to-body combat, designed especially for training of the army, of the police and of other forces of security.

The musado also is used in training of the special units, for example of the units of aerial war, of the brigades of rapid reaction and of the brigades of the UNO.

In the army of the Czech Republic this system was introduced in 1993. 

Musado MCS does not have any rules precisely given. However, with its vast extension it provides more than 4000 techniques and skills which with good mastery enable the warrior to stop an attack.

Chris Oddleifson

Christopher Roy Oddleifson (born September 7, 1950 in Brandon, Manitoba) is a retired professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League from 1972 until 1981. He is best known for his time with the Vancouver Canucks, where he was one of the team's top players for much of the 1970s and served as team captain in 1976–77.

Oddleifson was selected 10th overall in the 1970 NHL Amateur Draft by the California Golden Seals following a final junior season with the Winnipeg Jets of the WCHL, during which he finished with 95 points (including a league-leading 64 assists) and 243 penalty minutes. However, he was assigned to the minor leagues and would never play an National Hockey League game for the Seals, and was dealt to the Boston Bruins mid-way through the 1971–72 season. 

In 1972–73, Oddleifson finally made his NHL debut, appearing in 6 games for Boston without recording a point. He managed to crack the Bruins full-time in 1974–75, highlighted by a four-goal game against the Golden Seals, the team that had given up on him two years earlier. Late in the season, he was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks in a deal for sniper Bobby Schmautz, and he finished out his rookie season with decent totals of 13 goals and 29 points in 70 games between Boston and Vancouver. 

Oddleifson would have his breakout year in 1974–75, as he emerged as a leader on a young Canuck team which surprised by winning their division and making the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. He proved himself to be an exceptional all-around player who possessed size, toughness, and playmaking ability, as well as the ability to play both at center and on the wing. He lead the Canucks in scoring through the early part of the season, until a fractured jaw forced him to miss 20 games. Nevertheless, he finished with career highs of 16 goals and 35 assists for 51 points in just 60 games.

In 1975–76, Oddleifson would have his finest NHL season, as he notched 16 goals and a club-leading 46 assists for a career high 62 points. Although his production waned somewhat in the next few seasons, he remained one of the team's top all-around forwards and most popular players. He was named team captain for 1976–77, although he was replaced by Don Lever the following year. In 1977–78, he recorded a career-high 17 goals for the club. 

By the 1979–80 season, the emergence of young stars like Thomas Gradin, Stan Smyl and Curt Fraser, as well as the acquisition of several skilled veterans, had pushed Oddleifson into a mainly defensive role, and he finished the season with career lows of just 8 goals and 28 points. Early in the 1980–81 campaign, he was assigned to the Dallas Black Hawks, effectively ending his NHL career. 

Oddleifson spent two more seasons playing in Switzerland before retiring in 1983. He finished his NHL career with totals 95 goals and 191 assists for 286 points in 524 games, along with 464 penalty minutes.

Following his career, Oddleifson returned to Vancouver and became a successful real estate agent. He remains active with the Canuck Oldtimers squad.

Alex Plante

Alexandre "Alex" Plante (born May 9, 1989) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who is currently playing for the Oklahoma City Barons of the American Hockey League. He was selected by the Edmonton Oilers 15th overall in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft and made his National Hockey League (NHL) debut in 2009–10. He is the son of former professional defenceman Cam Plante, while his brother, Tyler, is a goaltender in the Florida Panthers organization.

Plante played junior hockey for the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League (WHL). The Hitmen selected him with their second round pick, 21st overall, in the 2004 WHL Bantam Draft. He established himself as a regular on Calgary's blue line in 2005–06, playing in 54 games. He appeared in 58 more in 2006–07 and attracted greater attention from NHL scouts in the 2007 playoffs, scoring 11 points in 13 games. As a result, the Edmonton Oilers selected him 15th overall in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, a higher position than he was initially expected to go. Several injuries limited Plante to 36 games in 2007–08 and he failed to report to Calgary's training camp prior to the 2008–09 WHL season, claiming that the team had treated him poorly the previous year. While he initially demanded a trade out of Calgary, Plante ultimately recanted and returned to the Hitmen early in the season. He rebounded from his "nightmare season" in 2007–08 to rank among the leaders of the Hitmen defence with 45 points in the regular season and another 15 in the playoffs before Calgary was upset in the league championship series by the Kelowna Rockets.

The Oilers signed Plante to a three-year contract following the season. He began his professional career in 2009–10 with Edmonton's top minor league affiliate, the Springfield Falcons of the American Hockey League (AHL). Several injuries on Edmonton's defence led the Oilers to recall Plante, and he made his NHL debut on February 1, 2010 against the Carolina Hurricanes and recorded an assist. He was returned to Springfield as injured players returned to the Oilers' lineup.

A Group 11 element is one in the series of elements in group 11 (IUPAC style) in the periodic table, consisting of transition metals which are the traditional coinage metals of copper (Cu), silver (Ag), and gold (Au). Roentgenium (Rg) belongs to this group of elements based on its electronic configuration, but it is a short-lived transactinide with a 22.8 seconds half-life that has only been observed in laboratory conditions. The name "coinage metals" is often used in casual speech to refer to these elements, but various cultures have used many other metals in coinage including aluminium, lead, nickel, stainless steel, and zinc.

All the elements of the group except Roentgenium have been known since prehistoric times, as all of them occur in metallic form in nature and no extraction metallurgy has to be used to produce them.

Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in its electron configuration, especially the outermost shells resulting in trends in chemical behavior:

They are all relatively inert, corrosion-resistant metals. Copper and gold are colored.

These elements have low electrical resistivity so they are used for wiring. Copper is the cheapest and most widely used. Bond wires for integrated circuits are usually gold. Silver and silver plated copper wiring are found in some special applications.

These metals, especially silver, have unusual properties that make them essential for industrial applications outside of their monetary or decorative value. They are all excellent conductors of electricity. The most conductive of all metals are silver, copper and gold in that order. Silver is also the most thermally conductive element, and the most light reflecting element. Silver also has the unusual property that the tarnish that forms on silver is still highly electrically conductive. 

Copper is used extensively in electrical wiring and circuitry. Gold contacts are sometimes found in precision equipment for their ability to remain corrosion-free. Silver is used widely in mission-critical applications as electrical contacts, and is also used in photography (because silver nitrate reverts to metal on exposure to light), agriculture, medicine, audiophile and scientific applications.

Gold, silver, and copper are quite soft metals and so are easily damaged in daily use as coins. Precious metal may also be easily abraded and worn away through use. In their numismatic functions these metals must be alloyed with other metals to afford coins greater durability. The alloying with other metals makes the resulting coins harder, less likely to become deformed and more resistant to wear.

Gold coins: Gold coins are typically produced as either 90% gold (e.g. with pre-1933 US coins), or 22 carat (92%) gold (e.g. current collectible coins and Krugerrands), with copper and silver making up the remaining weight in each case. Bullion gold coins are being produced with up to 99.999% gold (in the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf series).

Silver coins: Silver coins are typically produced as either 90% silver - in the case of pre 1965 US minted coins (which were circulated in many countries), or sterling silver (92.5%) coins for pre-1920 British Commonwealth and other silver coinage, with copper making up the remaining weight in each case.

Copper coins: Copper coins are often of quite high purity, around 97%, and are usually alloyed with small amounts of zinc and tin.

Inflation has caused the face value of coins to fall below the hard currency value of the historically used metals. This had led to most modern coins being made of base metals - copper nickel (around 80:20, silver in color) is popular as are nickel-brass (copper (75), nickel (5) and zinc (20), gold in color), manganese-brass (copper, zinc, manganese, and nickel), bronze, or simple plated steel.

Calvin cycle

The Calvin cycle (also known as the Calvin–Benson cycle) is the set of chemical reactions that take place in chloroplasts during photosynthesis. 

The cycle is light-independent because it takes place after the energy has been captured from sunlight. 

The Calvin cycle is named after Melvin Calvin, who won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for finding it in 1961. Calvin and his colleagues did the work at the University of California, Berkeley.

Using the radioactive carbon-14 isotope as a tracer, Calvin, Andrew Benson and their team mapped the complete route that carbon travels through a plant during photosynthesis. They traced the carbon-14 from its absorption as atmospheric carbon dioxide to its conversion into carbohydrates and other organic compounds. The single-celled algae "Chlorella" was used to trace the carbon-14.

The Calvin group showed that sunlight acts on the chlorophyll in a plant to fuel the manufacture of organic compounds, not directly on carbon dioxide as previously believed.

"Source:"

1. Grab: A five-carbon carbon catcher catches one molecule of carbon dioxide and forms a six-carbon molecule.

2. Split: the enzyme RuBisCO (with the energy of ATP and NADPH molecules) breaks the six-carbon molecule into two equal parts.

3. Leave: A trio of three carbons leave and become sugar. The other trio moves on to the next step.

4. Switch: Using ATP and NADPH, the three carbon molecule is changed into a five carbon molecule.

5. The cycle starts over again.

The carbohydrate products of the Calvin cycle are three-carbon sugar phosphate molecules, or 'triose phosphates' (G3P). Each step of the cycle has its own enzyme which speeds up the reaction.

King John had lost mainland Normandy in 1204, and kept only the Channel Islands. Today the Channel Islands still owe allegiance to the King or Queen of Britain.

In 1660 when King Charles II was restored to the throne, the King of France, Louis XIV, created Charles brother James Duke of Normandy, probably as a show of support for monarchy and to stop Charles claiming the title himself.

2010–2011 Queensland floods

The 2010–2011 Queensland floods were a series of floods in Australia which began in November 2010. Most of the floods were in Queensland including its capital city, Brisbane. The rain also caused floods further south in central and western Victoria with more than 70 towns flooded. A huge area of Queensland, the size of Germany and France combined, was flooded. The floods forced thousands of people to leave their homes. At least 70 towns In Queensland and over 200,000 people were affected. Three-quarters of the state of Queensland has been declared a disaster zone. The 2010–2011 floods have killed 30 people across Queensland since November and 14 are still missing. More than 20 people have died in flash floods between Brisbane and Toowoomba.. The cost of the floods is said to be A$30 billion.
The floods were caused by heavy rain from tropical cyclone "Tasha" that joined with a trough during a La Niña event. La Niña is an unusual weather pattern, which brings wet weather to eastern Australia. The 2010 La Niña was the strongest since 1973. This caused heavy rainfall across Queensland. December 2010 was the wettest on record, with 107 places getting their highest rainfalls ever. The state average rainfall level of 209.45mm was much bigger the old record of 200.1mm set in 1975. 2010 was also recorded as the state's wettest spring since 1900 and the Australia's third wettest year. Flooding started across parts of the state in early December. On 24 December a monsoonal trough crossed the coast from the Coral Sea, bringing very heavy rain from the Gulf of Carpentaria to the Gold Coast.

About 300 roads were closed, including nine major highways. Many places, including Condamine and Chinchilla were flooded several times. Coal railway lines were closed and many mine sites flooded. The floods have caused fruit and vegetable prices to rise as crops have been destroyed.. The wet conditions have also led to a large number of snakes seeking safety on the higher ground or in houses with people. Saltwater crocodiles and sharks were seen in some flooded areas of towns.
The flooding forced 1,000 people to leave Theodore and other towns. The military transported people by helicopter to an evacuation centre at Moura. The total evacuation of a Queensland town had never happened before.

Emerald was cut-off by road on 29 December as the Nogoa River rose. The next day, the river level rose above the 2008 flood peak level of . At the peak of the flooding, 80% of the town was flooded, the worst the town ever experienced. 1,200 people from Emerald were listed as evacuees.
Rockhampton had nearly a week to get ready for the flood peak from the Fitzroy River, which flows through the centre of the city. The airport was closed on 1 January. A metal flood barrier was set up to protect the buildings. An evacuation centre was set up at the Central Queensland University. The Bruce Highway leading south out of Rockhampton was closed to traffic. The river reached just short the of the predicted maximum.

The Port of Gladstone cut back its coal exports because the coal piles at the port were too wet and further coal deliveries could not be made by rail. The Goonyella railway line which is used by a number of coal mines in the Bowen Basin was closed for one week and shipments of grain were also stopped.

The towns of Gayndah and Mundubbera when the Burnett River flooded on 28–29 December. The river peaked at at Mundubbera. This was the highest river height since 1942 and flooded more thane than 20 houses. Downstream at Gayndah, the river peaked at with floodwaters reaching two houses. Both towns were isolated for several days and there was major disruption to the drinking water supply and local agricultural production.

Bundaberg had its worst flooding in 40 years, after the Burnett River flooded the city. Floodwater forced 300 households to leave their homes.

Chinchilla and Jericho were also flooded. At least 40 people were evacuated from Chinchilla.

Flooding in Dalby was the worst since 1981. The town's water purification system was flooded, resulting in water restrictions that have not helped clean-up efforts. 112500 litres of water were transported to the town of 14,000 residents. Warwick was isolated when all roads into the town were cut-off.

The Condamine River reached on 30 December, its highest level ever recorded. People were forced to leave Condamine on 30 December.

Floodwaters are passing downstream along the Balonne River and towards the towns of Surat and St George. The river is expected to peak at at Surat and at St George. The New South Wales towns of Angledoo, Goodoga and Weilmoringle are expected to be isolated when floodwaters from the Balonne reach the Culgoa and Bokhara Rivers.

More rain on 9–10 January saw floodwaters again threaten Chinchilla and Condamine with Chinchilla residents again asked to leave.

The Macintyre River, which forms part of the border between the Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland, began to threaten the town of Goondiwindi on 13 January. The town is protected by a levee, but the local hospital and aged care home have been evacuated and an evacuation centre established.

Heavy rain in the Mary River area on 8–9 January 2011 lead to flooding at Maryborough and Gympie. The Mary River at Maryborough was expected to initially peak at at midday 9 January with some houses and businesses flooded. A second peak is expected to arrive from rain falling upstream later that day. At Gympie, the Mary River is expected to peak at , possibly increasing to —over the major flood level—if rain continues to fall.

The city of Toowoomba, in the Darling Downs, was hit by flash flooding after more than of rain fell in 36 hours to 10 January 2011. This event caused four deaths in a matter of hours. Toowoomba is located on the Great Dividing Range, some above sea level. A three week period where it had rained on all but three days had left the soil around Toowoomba very wet. When a line of storms hit the city on 10 January, the heavy rain rapidly ran off down gullies and streets. The central business district of the city sits in a small valley where East Creek and West Creek meet to form Gowrie Creek. With so much water the creeks burst their banks, pushing a devastating wall of water through the city centre.
Nearby Gatton saw people leave their homes as the Lockyer Creek rose to a record height of , higher than the previous record set in the 1893 Queensland floods. The flood passed through the Lockyer Valley town of Withcott, where the force of the water pushed cars into shops and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people. The scene was described by an onlooker as "like Cyclone Tracy has gone through it ... If you dropped an atom bomb on it, you couldn't tell the difference." Grantham was also hit hard by the flooding rains. Houses were left crumpled by what Premier of Queensland Anna Bligh described as an "inland tsunami". According to local media, the flood waters had reached a height of by the time it struck Grantham. Nine people died, and 66 reported missing. The body of one victim washed away at Grantham was found downstream. The Queensland Police Commissioner Bob Atkinson warned that some bodies may never be found.

On 11 January 2011 at around 2:30 pm EST, the Brisbane River broke its banks leading to evacuations in the Brisbane CBD and the suburbs of Fortitude Valley and West End. An evacuation centre was set up at the RNA Showgrounds in Bowen Hills. According to media, people living in 2100 Brisbane streets had been told to leave before the arrival of floods, which struck the city on 12 January. Brisbane Mayor Campbell Newman stated than about 20,000 homes would be affected when the river peaks on 14 January Newman also stated that the Brisbane River transport system had been "substantially destroyed".

On 13 January the Brisbane River did not reach anticipated heights but still 20,000 houses in Brisbane were flooded. Some of the Brisbane neighbourhoods worst affected by the floods include St Lucia, West End, Rocklea and Graceville. The floods have damaged some of Brisbane's icons. The Brisbane Riverwalk—a floating walkway over the Brisbane River linking the inner city neighbourhoods of Fortitude Valley and New Farm broke up. One section formed a "floating missile" that threatened the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges. The largest part of the floating boardwalk was safely guided under the bridge by a tugboat and past other infrastructure before being safely secured. Brisbane's major Association football and Rugby league venue, Suncorp Stadium filled with water up to deep, reaching the third or fourth row of seats.

With the flood peaking at 4.46 m in Brisbane, the floods were the sixth highest in the city's history. Parts of the western suburbs of Brisbane were cut off for three days. People in suburbs including Bellbowrie, Moggill and Pullenvale were running low on food and other items when Moggill Road was cut until the Australian Army was able to reach the area on 15 January with much needed supplies.
The Bremer River at Ipswich— west of Brisbane—reached a height of on 12 January, flooding the central business district and at least 3,000 houses. One third of the city was said to be underwater and over 1100 people had taken shelter at evacuation centres. At nearby Marburg, a 4 year old boy was swept away by floodwaters when he fell from a rescue boat. A man in his 50s died when he accidentally drove into floodwaters in the Ipswich suburb of Wulkuraka. The worst affected areas of Ipswich were the suburbs of Goodna and Gailes.

In South East Queensland, the Wivenhoe Dam filled to a level equivalent to 191% of its supply capacity on 11 January 2011. Brisbane experienced its wettest December since 1859. Wyaralong Dam, near Beaudesert, had recently been completed and is receiving praise for reducing flooding in downstream Logan, having exceeded 80% of its capacity.

In North Queensland, the town of Ingham became isolated as the Herbert River peaked. Homes at Babinda, and Gordonvale were flooded.

As of 14 January 2011, the floods have led to 30 deaths, 15 of which are from the Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley area. Another 14 people are listed as missing, after the flash flood struck Toowoomba, Lockyer Valley, Brisbane and Ipswich.

The first death was reported on 20 November 2010, when a woman drowned in her vehicle near Dysart. In the following weeks, five others also drowned in their cars.

Nine people drowned after being caught directly by the flowing waters. and thirteen people died in other circumstances.

The following list shows how where and how many of the deaths happened.

Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard visited flooded areas on 31 December. The Queen of Australia, Elizabeth II, sent her expressions of concern and sympathy for the victims of the floods to her representative in Queensland, Governor Penelope Wensley. The Queen later gave money to her Queensland premier's flood relief appeal, as did her son, Prince Charles.

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, "On behalf of President Obama and the people of the United States, I offer my condolences for the loss of life and damage in Queensland caused by the recent flooding." U.S. President Barack Obama said he was ready to help.

John Key, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, held a telephone call with Gillard. She thanked New Zealand for its help. Auckland, a sister city of Brisbane offered its help, with Auckland Mayor Len Brown sending Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman a message of support.

Major General Michael Slater was put in charge a civilian recovery task force.

The Australian Defence Force's contribution to flood relief efforts was named Operation Queensland Flood Assist. The ADF established Joint Task Force 637, based at Enoggera Barracks in Brisbane, for operational command of on 1 January 2011.

Food supplies have not been able to reach northern Queensland and have been transported to Townsville by ship.

About 35 State Emergency Service workers from New South Wales and 20 from Victoria were used to provide a rest for tired staff and volunteers. A national appeal was set up on 29 December, with the state and federal governments giving A$1 million each.

Small businesses and farmers in 13 local government areas can get grants of up to A$25,000 to pay for costs from damage caused by the floods. National Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements were made available to a total of 31 local government areas across Queensland.

New Zealand, one of Australia's closest allies, said they would be sending two fifteen member civil defence teams to assist in flood rescue efforts. New Zealand will also send a number of New Zealand Defence Force soldiers, mainly engineers, as well as New Zealand Police and New Zealand Fire Service firefighters. A New Zealand Red Cross team was also dispatched.

On 17 January 2011, Anna Bligh said a Commission of Inquiry would look at the floods. The Commission will investigate all the things that caused the floods, what the government did during the floods, and what things need to be changed in future. The final report is due in one year.

On 9 January, the "Flood Relief Appeal: Australia Unites" telethon broadcast by the Nine Network from Brisbane's Suncorp Piazza raised more than A$10 million in aid.

At the Twenty20 cricket match between Australia and England in Adelaide on 12 January, both teams gave part of their match fees to help the victims and A$28,450 was collected from the crowds.

On 16 January, the day before the 2011 Australian Open, a number of players took part in the "Rally for Relief". This was held at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, and 15,000 people went to see it and raised A$750,000. The Seven Network showed the games on television. Players who took part included Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Lleyton Hewitt, Novak Djokovic and Andy Roddick.

Daintree Rainforest

The Daintree Rainforest is a tropical rainforest in Queensland, Australia. At around 1200 square kilometres the Daintree is the largest continuous area of tropical rainforest on the Australian mainland. 

The Daintree Rainforest is a main part of the 'Wet Tropics of Queensland', listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988.

The Daintree Rainforest meets all four natural criteria on the Criteria for Selection to be a World Heritage Site. It is one of only twelve natural World Heritage Sites worldwide that meet all four criteria. The Daintree area is adjacent to another World Heritage site, the Great Barrier Reef. This makes it the only place in the world where two natural World Heritage Sites meet. 

The Daintree Rainforest contains 30% of the frog, marsupial and reptile species in Australia, and 65% of Australia's bat and butterfly species. 18% of bird species in the country can be found in this area. There are also over 12,000 species of insects. All of this diversity is contained within an area that takes up 0.2% of Australia.

The Daintree Rainforest is extremely ancient; it is thought to be over one hundred and thirty-five million years old. About 430 species of birds live among the trees. The primitive flowering plants "Austrobaileya scandens" and "Idiospermum australiense" are also endemic to the Daintree.

The forest is north of Mossman, Queensland, on the coast, north of Cairns in the tropical far north of Australia. Named after Richard Daintree, part of the forest is protected by the Daintree National Park and drained by the Daintree River.

The Daintree Rainforest is loosely defined as the area between the Mossman Gorge and the Bloomfield River. The roads north of the Daintree River wind through areas of lush forest, and have been designed to minimize impacts on the forest.

The Daintree Region is home to a number of rare and endangered species, including the Southern Cassowary and Bennett's Tree-kangaroo. Other animals include the Saltwater crocodile and the Musky Rat-kangaroo.

The rainforest also holds many ancient plants which have survived from the southern supercontinent Gondwana.

Rotes Rathaus

The Red City Hall () is the town hall of Berlin, located in the Mitte borough on Rathausstraße near Alexanderplatz. It is the home to the governing mayor and the government (the Senate of Berlin) of the Federal state of Berlin. The landmark building got its name from the red clinker bricks with which it is covered.

The Rathaus was built between 1861 and 1869 in the style of the north Italian High Renaissance by Hermann Friedrich Waesemann. It was modelled on the Old Town Hall of Toruń, now in Poland, while the architecture of the tower is reminiscent of the cathedral tower of Notre-Dame of Laon in France. It replaced several individual buildings dating from the Middle Ages and now fills an entire city block.

The building was heavily damaged by Allied bombing in World War II and rebuilt to the original plans between 1951 and 1956. The "Neues Stadthaus", which survived the bombing and had been the head office of the Berlin city fire insurance company in Parochialstraße was the temporary city hall for the post-war city government for all four sectors of Berlin until September 1948. Following that time, it housed only those of the Soviet sector. The reconstructed Rotes Rathaus, then located in the Soviet sector, served as the town hall of East Berlin, while the Rathaus Schöneberg in Schöneberg borough was seat of the West Berlin Senate. After German reunification, the administration of reunified Berlin officially moved into the Rotes Rathaus on 1 October 1991.

<doc id="278842" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=278842" title="Unter den Linden">
Unter den Linden

Unter den Linden ("under the linden trees") is a boulevard in the Mitte district of Berlin, the capital of Germany. It is named for its linden (lime in British English) trees that line the grassed pedestrian mall in the middle of the road

Unter den Linden runs east–west from the site of the former Stadtschloss royal palace at the Lustgarten park, where the demolished Palast der Republik used to be, to Pariser Platz and Brandenburg Gate. Eastward the boulevard crosses the river Spree near the Dom (Berlin Cathedral) and continues as Karl-Liebknecht-Straße. The western continuation behind Brandenburg Gate is Straße des 17. Juni. Major north–south streets crossing Unter den Linden are Friedrichstraße and Wilhelmstrasse. 

Unter den Linden at the heart of the historic section of Berlin developed from a bridle path laid out by Elector John George of Brandenburg in the 16th century to reach his hunting grounds in the Tiergarten. It was replaced by a boulevard of linden trees planted in 1647, stretching from the city palace to the gates of the city, by order of the “Great Elector” Frederick William. While the western part of the boulevard retained its character, the area around present-day Bebelplatz was changed after the Thirty Years' War and fortified. There are no trees. 

By the 19th century, as Berlin grew and expanded to the west, Unter den Linden became the best-known and grandest street in Berlin. In 1851 the famous equestrian (horse-riding) statue of King Frederick the Great, designed by Christian Daniel Rauch, was put up on the centre strip. In the course of the building of the Nord-Süd-Tunnel for the Berlin S-Bahn in 1934/35 most of the linden trees were cut down and during the last days of World War II the remaining trees were destroyed or cut down for firewood. The present-day linden were replanted in the 1950s, they are affected by air pollution as well as by soil contamination.

Since 1937, the numbering has started at the "Schlossbrücke" (Palace Bridge), connecting Unter den Linden with the Lustgarten and Museum Island. The disputed replica of the Alte Kommandantur is No. 1, vis-à-vis the Zeughaus arsenal, the oldest building on Unter den Linden, built between 1695 and 1706, today the seat of the "Deutsches Historisches Museum" (No. 2). Buildings along the street include (from east to west) the Kronprinzenpalais (former palace of the Hohenzollern crown princes, No. 3), the Neue Wache war memorial built in 1817 (No. 4), considered by many to be Karl Friedrich Schinkel’s masterpiece. Furthermore on Bebelplatz the Berlin State Opera (No. 7), coloquially called "Lindenoper", St. Hedwig's Cathedral and the "Altes Palais" (No. 9), favoured residence of Emperor Wilhelm I; in the north the main building of the Humboldt University (No. 6) and House I of the Berlin State Library (No. 8). On the western end are the Russian Embassy (former Soviet Embassy, No. 63-65) the Hungarian Embassy (No. 76) at the corner of Wilhelmstrasse and finally the Hotel Adlon (No. 77) at the corner of Pariser Platz, which has been completely rebuilt on the site of the prewar hotel. Well-known statues of Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt in front of the university as well as of the Prussian generals Scharnhorst and Bülow also adorn the street.

Frederick II of Prussia

Frederick II (; 24 January 1712-17 August 1786) was a King in Prussia (1740–1772) and a King of Prussia (1772-1786) from the Hohenzollern dynasty. As a prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire, he was Frederick IV Margrave of Brandenburg. He was also the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel. He became known as Frederick the Great () and was nicknamed "der alte Fritz" ("Old Fritz").

When he was young, Frederick was mostly interested in music and philosophy and not military affairs. Frederick tried to escape from his strict father, Frederick William I, with childhood friend, Hans Hermann von Katte. When they were captured Frederick was forced to watch von Kattel's execution. 

Shortly after becoming King in Prussia, he attacked Austria and claimed Silesia during the Silesian Wars. Near the end of his life, Frederick united most of his separated parts of his kingdom through the First Partition of Poland.

For years Frederick exchanged letters with Voltaire. He modernized the Prussian bureaucracy and civil service and promoted religious tolerance. Frederick patronized the arts and philosophers, and wrote flute music. Frederick is buried at his favorite residence, Sanssouci in Potsdam. Because he died childless, Frederick was succeeded by his nephew, Frederick William II of Prussia, son of his brother, Prince Augustus William of Prussia.

In 1732, Queen Sophia Dorothea tried to arrange a dual marriage of Frederick and his sister Wilhelmina with Amelia and Frederick, the children of her brother, King George II of Great Britain. Fearing an alliance between Prussia and Great Britain, Field Marshal von Seckendorff, the Austrian ambassador in Berlin, bribed Field Marshal von Grumbkow, the Prussian Minister of War, and Benjamin Reichenbach, Prussian ambassador in London. They pair discreetly slandered the British and Prussian courts in the eyes of the two kings. Angered by the idea of the marriage Frederick William madeimpossible demands to the British, such as Prussia acquiring Jülich and Berg, leading to the collapse of the marriage proposal.

After von Kattel died Frederick was granted a royal pardon and released from his cell on 18 November, but he was not given back his military rank. Instead of returning to Berlin, however, he was forced to stay in Küstrin and began learning statecraft and administration for the War and Estates Departments on 20 November. Tensions eased slightly when Frederick William visited Küstrin a year later, and Frederick was allowed to visit Berlin on the occasion of his sister Wilhelmina's marriage to Margrave Frederick of Bayreuth on 20 November 1731. The crown prince returned to Berlin after finally being released from Küstrin on 26 February 1732.

Frederick William considered marrying Frederick to Elisabeth of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the niece of Empress Anna of Russia, but this plan was opposed by Prince Eugene of Savoy. Frederick himself proposed marrying Maria Theresa of Austria in return for renouncing the succession. Instead, Eugene persuaded Frederick William, through Seckendorff, that the crown prince marry Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Bevern, a Protestant relative of the Austrian Habsburgs. Although Frederick wrote to his sister that, "There can be neither love nor friendship between us," and he considered suicide, he went along with the wedding on 12 June 1733. He had little in common with his bride and resented the political marriage as an example of the Austrian interference which had plagued Prussia since 1701. Once Frederick secured the throne in 1740, he would not let Elisabeth visit his court in Potsdam, and instead gave her Schönhausen Palace and apartments at the Berliner Stadtschloss. Frederick bestowed the title of the heir to the throne, "Prince of Prussia", on his brother Augustus William; despite this, his wife remained devoted to him.

Frederick was given back a rank in the Prussian Army as Colonel of the Regiment von der Goltz, stationed near Nauen and Neuruppin. When Prussia gave troops to help Austria during the War of the Polish Succession, Frederick studied under Prince Eugene of Savoy during the campaign against France on the Rhine. Frederick William, weakened by gout brought about by the campaign, gave Frederick Schloss Rheinsberg in Rheinsberg, north of Neuruppin. In Rheinsberg, Frederick assembled a small number of musicians, actors and other artists. He spent his time reading, watching dramatic plays, making and listening to music, and regarded this time as one of the happiest of his life. Frederick formed the "Bayard Order" to discuss warfare with his friends; Heinrich August de la Motte Fouqué was made the grand master of the gatherings.

The works of Niccolò Machiavelli, such as "The Prince", were considered a guideline for the behaviour of a king in Frederick's age. In 1739, Frederick finished his "Anti-Machiavel", which put another point of view. It was published anonymously in 1740, but Voltaire distributed it in Amsterdam. 

Frederick's years dedicated to the arts instead of politics ended upon the 1740 death of Frederick William and his inheritance of the Kingdom of Prussia.

When Frederick ascended the throne as "King in Prussia" in 1740, Prussia consisted of scattered territories, including Cleves, Mark, and Ravensberg in the west of the Holy Roman Empire; Brandenburg, Hither Pomerania, and Farther Pomerania in the east of the Empire; and the former Duchy of Prussia, outside of the Empire bordering the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was titled "King in Prussia" because this was only part of historic Prussia; he was to declare himself "King of Prussia" after acquiring most of the rest in 1772.

Frederick's goal was to modernize and unite his vulnerably disconnected lands; toward this end, he fought wars mainly against Austria, whose Habsburg dynasty reigned as Holy Roman Emperors, almost continuously from the 15th century until 1806. Frederick established Prussia as the fifth and smallest European great power by using the resources his frugal father had cultivated.

The First Silesian War (1740–1742), part of the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), resulted in Frederick conquering the Polish part of Silesia. Austria attempted to recover Silesia in the Second Silesian War (1744–1745), but Frederick was victorious again and forced Austria to stick to the previous peace terms. Prussian possession of Silesia gave the kingdom control over the Oder River.
Habsburg Austria and Bourbon France, traditional enemies, allied together in the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756 following the collapse of the Anglo-Austrian Alliance. Frederick swiftly made an alliance with Great Britain at the Convention of Westminster. As neighboring countries began conspiring against him, Frederick was determined to strike first. On 29 August 1756 his well-prepared army crossed the frontier and invaded Saxony, thus beginning the Seven Years' War which lasted until 1763. He faced widespread criticism for his attack on neutral Saxony and for his forcible incorporation of the Saxon forces into the Prussian army following the Siege of Pirna in October 1756.

Facing a coalition which included Austria, France, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden, and having only Great Britain and Hanover as his allies, Frederick narrowly kept Prussia in the war despite having his territories frequently invaded.

The sudden death of Empress Elizabeth of Russia led to the succession of the pro-Prussian Peter III. This led to the collapse of the anti-Prussian coalition. Although Frederick did not gain any territory in the ensuing Treaty of Hubertusburg, he was able to keep Silesia and Prussia became popular in many German-speaking territories.

Late in his life Frederick also involved Prussia in the low-scale War of the Bavarian Succession in 1778, in which he stopped Austrian attempts to exchange the Austrian Netherlands for Bavaria. When Emperor Joseph II|Joseph II tried the scheme again in 1784, Frederick created the "Fürstenbund", allowing himself to be seen as a defender of German liberties, in contrast to his earlier role of attacking the imperial Habsburgs.

Frederick frequently led his military forces personally and had six horses shot from under him during battle. Frederick is often admired as one of the greatest tactical geniuses of all time, especially for his usage of the oblique order of battle. Even more important were his operational successes, especially preventing the unification of numerically superior opposing armies and being at the right place at the right time to keep enemy armies out of Prussian core territory. In a letter to his mother Maria Theresa, the Austrian co-ruler Emperor Joseph II wrote,

Frederick changed Prussia from a European backwater to an economically strong and politically reformed state. His took of Silesia to give Prussia's new industries raw materials, and he protected these industries with high tariffs and minimal restrictions on internal trade. Canals were built, including between the Vistula and the Oder, swamps were drained for agriculture, and new crops, such as the potato and the turnip, were introduced. Frederick regarded his reclamation of land in the Oderbruch as a province conquered in peace. With the help of French experts, he reorganized the system of indirect taxes, which provided the state with more revenue than direct taxes. Frederick the Great commissioned Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky to promote the trade and - to take on the competition with France - put a silk factory where soon 1,500 persons found employment. Frederick the Great followed his recommendations in the field of toll levies and import restrictions. In 1763 when Gotzkowsky went broke during a financial crisis, which started in Amsterdam, Frederick took over his porcelain factory, known as KPM, but refused to buy more of his paintings.

During the reign of Frederick, the effects of the Seven Years' War and the gaining of Silesia greatly changed the economy. The circulation of depreciated money kept prices high. To revalue the Thaler, the Mint Edict of May 1763 was proposed. This stabilized the rates of depreciated coins that would not be accepted and provided for the payments of taxes in currency of prewar value. This was replaced in northern Germany by the Reichsthaler, worth one-fourth of a Conventionsthaler. Prussia used a Thaler containing one-fourteenth of a Cologne mark of silver. Many other rulers soon followed the steps of Frederick in reforming their own currencies this resulted in a shortage of ready money thus lowering prices.

Frederick gave his state a modern bureaucracy whose mainstay until 1760 was the able War and Finance Minister Adam Ludwig von Blumenthal, succeeded in 1764 by his nephew Joachim who ran the ministry to the end of the reign and beyond. Prussia's education system was seen as one of the best in Europe. Frederick also abolished torture and corporal punishment.

Frederick began titling himself "King "of" Prussia" after the acquisition of Royal Prussia (West Prussia) in 1772; the phrasing "King "in" Prussia" had been used since the coronation of Frederick I in Königsberg in 1701.

Frederick generally supported religious toleration, including keeping Jesuits as teachers in Silesia, Warmia, and the Netze District after their suppression by Pope Clement XIV. He was interested in attracting a many skills to his country, whether from Jesuit teachers, Huguenot citizens, or Jewish merchants and bankers, particularly from Spain. He wanted development throughout the country. As an example of this practical-minded but not fully unprejudiced tolerance, Frederick wrote in his "Testament politique" that:

Jews on the Polish border were therefore encouraged to perform all the trade they could and received all the protection and support from the king as any other Prussian citizen. The success in integrating the Jews into those areas of society that Frederick encouraged them in can be seen by the role played by Gerson von Bleichröder in financing Bismarck's efforts to reunite Germany.

As under Frederick much wasteland was made arable Prussia was looking for new colonists. Frederick repeatedly emphasized that nationality and religion were of no concern to him.

Frederick had famous buildings constructed in his capital, Berlin, most of which still exist today, such as the Berlin State Opera, the Royal Library (today the State Library Berlin), St. Hedwig's Cathedral, and Prince Henry's Palace (now the site of Humboldt University). However, the king preferred spending his time in his summer residence Potsdam, where he built the palace of Sanssouci, the most important work of Northern German rococo. Sanssouci, which translates from French as "carefree" or "without worry", was a refuge for Frederick. "Frederician Rococo" developed under Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff.

Many historians have considered whether Frederick the Great was homosexual or bisexual (and perhaps possibly celibate). Frederick was forced to marry Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Bevern, with whom he had no children. He immediately separated from his wife when Frederick William I died in 1740. In later years, Frederick would pay his wife formal visits only once a year.

Near the end of his life Frederick spent more and more time alone. His circle of friends at Sanssouci gradually died off without replacements, and Frederick became increasingly critical and arbitrary, to the frustration of the civil service and officer corps. The people of Berlin always cheered the king when he returned to the city from provincial tours or military reviews, but Frederick took no pleasure from his popularity with the common folk, preferring instead the company of his pet Italian greyhounds, whom he referred to as his 'marquises de Pompadour' as a jibe at Madame de Pompadour. Frederick died in an armchair in his study in the palace of Sanssouci on 17 August 1786.

Frederick had wished to be buried next to his greyhounds on the vineyard terrace on the side of the corps de logis of Sanssouci. His nephew and successor Frederick William II instead ordered the body be entombed next to his father in the church of the Potsdam garrison. Near the end of World War II, Adolf Hitler ordered the coffins of Frederick and Frederick William I, as well as those of Paul von Hindenburg and his wife, transferred first to an underground bunker near Berlin, then hidden in a salt mine close to the town of Bernrode, Germany, to protect them from destruction. The US Army discovered the four coffins on 27 April 1945, behind a 6-foot-thick (1.8 m) masonry wall deep within the mine, and moved them to the basement of Marburg Castle, a collection point for recovered Nazi "treasure". As part of a secret project dubbed "Operation Bodysnatch"

, the US Army relocated both kings first to the Elisabeth Church of Marburg and then on to Burg Hohenzollern close to the town of Hechingen. After German reunification, the body of Frederick William was entombed in the Kaiser Friedrich Mausoleum in Sanssouci's Church of Peace.

On the 205th anniversary of his death, on 17 August 1991, Frederick's casket lay in state in the court of honor of Sanssouci, covered by a Prussian flag and escorted by a Bundeswehr guard of honour. After nightfall, Frederick's body was finally laid to rest on the terrace of the vineyard of Sanssouci, according to his last will without pomp and at night ("... Im übrigen will ich, was meine Person anbetrifft, in Sanssouci beigesetzt werden, ohne Prunk, ohne Pomp und bei Nacht..." (1757))..

King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, is named after the King of Prussia Inn, itself named in honor of Frederick.

Prussia Street in Dublin, Ireland, is named after Frederick the Great.

"The Great King" () is a 1942 German drama film directed by Veit Harlan and starring Otto Gebühr. It depicts the life of Frederick the Great. It received the rare "Film of the Nation" distinction. Otto Gebühr also played the King in many other films.


In the 2004 German film "Der Untergang", Adolf Hitler is shown sitting in a dark room forlornly gazing at a painting of Frederick, possibly a reference to the dictator's fading hopes for another Miracle of the House of Brandenburg.

In the 1970 film "Patton", General Patton incorrectly cites Frederick the Great as saying, "L'audace, l'audace, toujours l'audace!" ("Audacity, audacity — always audacity!")

Although Frederick is never seen on screen, he is mentioned several times in Stanley Kubrick's 1975 film "Barry Lyndon". In the film, he is referred to as "The great and illustrious Frederick" and his army is both praised and criticized. For example, a quote from the film: "During the five years which the war had now lasted, the great and illustrious Frederick had so exhausted the males of his kingdom that he had to employ scores of recruiters who hesitated no crime, including kidnapping, to keep supplied those brilliant regiments of his with food for powder."

King in Prussia

King in Prussia was the title used by the rulers of Prussia from 1702 to 1772.

The rulers, who were also Princes and Margraves of Brandenberg wanted to be Kings, but knew that the Holy Roman Emperor would not allow them the title. 

In return for support in the War of the Spanish Succession Emperor Leopold I allowed Frederick to call himself King in Prussia. The Duchy of Prussia was outside the Empire, and he was only regarded as King outside the Empire.

In 1772 Frederick II annexed most of Poland and decided to call himself King of Prussia. The Holy Roman Emperor was not as strong as they had been, and in 1806 the Empire ceased to exist.

Prince-electors were the group of rulers of German countries which elected the Holy Roman Emperor. In English they were usually called "Electors" and included the Elector of Brandenburg, who also began ruling as King of Prussia, and the Electors of Hanover, who were also kings of Great Britain after 1714.

<doc id="278893" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=278893" title="Mantis shrimp">
Mantis shrimp

Mantis shrimps are crustacean stomatopods. 

They are not actually shrimps, but members of the order Stomatopoda. There are about 400 species.

They are predators which kill their prey by hitting them at high speed. 

They hold their body in a manner like that of a praying mantis, and have large, complex eyes. Some species can be 30 cm long. 

They are highly coloured, and live in shallow tropical and subtropical habitats such as coral reefs.

Each species has one of these two methods of attack

Both types strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey, and are capable of inflicting serious damage on victims larger than themselves.
In smashers, these two weapons are employed with blinding quickness, and hit their prey with the speed of a bullet. This is one of the fastest responses known to man. 

Smashers use this ability to attack snails, crabs, molluscs and rock oysters; their blunt clubs enabling them to crack the shells of their prey into pieces. Spearers, on the other hand, prefer the meat of softer animals, like fish, which their barbed claws can more easily slice and snag.

Because they strike so rapidly, they generate cavitation bubbles between the appendage and the striking surface. The collapse of these bubbles hits their prey in addition to the impact of the appendage against the striking surface. 

This means that the prey is hit twice by a single strike; first by the claw and then by the collapsing cavitation bubbles that immediately follow. Even if the initial strike misses the prey, the resulting shock wave can be enough to kill or stun the prey.

Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other. They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.

The mantis shrimp has such good eyes it can perceive both polarized light, and colour vision outside the normal visual spectrum.

Some species have at least 16 different photoreceptor types, 12 of them for colour analysis in the different wavelengths (including four which are sensitive to ultraviolet light) and four of them for analysing polarised light. By comparison, humans have only four visual pigments, three dedicated to see colour. 

The eyes of mantis shrimp may recognize different types of coral, prey species (which are often transparent or semi-transparent), or predators, such as barracuda, which have shimmering scales. 

Also, the manner in which mantis shrimp hunt (very rapid movements of the claws) may require very accurate ranging information, which would require accurate depth perception.

During mating rituals, mantis shrimp actively fluoresce, and the wavelength of this fluorescence matches the wavelengths detected by their eye pigments. 

Females are only fertile during certain phases of the tidal cycle; the ability to perceive the phase of the moon may therefore help prevent wasted mating efforts. It may also give mantis shrimp information about the size of the tide, which is important for species living in shallow water near the shore.

<doc id="278896" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=278896" title="List of rulers of Saxony">
List of rulers of Saxony

This article lists Dukes, Electors, and Kings ruling over territories named Saxony from the beginning of the Saxon Duchy in the 9th century to the end of the Saxon Kingdom in 1918.

The original Duchy of Saxony was the lands of the Saxon people in the north-western part of present-day Germany, namely, the modern German state of Lower Saxony as well as Westphalia and Western Saxony-Anhalt, not the modern German state of Saxony.

Early dukes

Hattonid dynasty

When the Welfs left in 1180, the Duchy of Saxony lost a lot of territory. Westphalia fell to the Archbishop of Cologne, while the Duchies of Brunswick and Lüneburg remained with the Welfs. The Ascanian Dukes had their base further east, near the Elbe, so the name Saxony moved towards the east. The post carve-up Saxony is therefore sometimes called the "younger Duchy of Saxony". Also the counting of its dukes its mixed up. While the first post carve-up duke is sometimes called Bernard III - because of two predecessors of the same name before 1180 - or Bernard I with his great-great-great-great grandson Bernard II being counted second. The second post carve-up duke Albert I is already usually counted as the first, although before 1180 he had one predecessor of the same name, his grandfather Albert the Bear.

The new dukes changed the Saxon horse emblem () and used their Ascanian family colours and emblem (black and gold stripes) () and added a "bendwise crancelin", a crown diagonally across the coat of arms, symbolising the Saxon ducal crown, as new coat-of-arms of Saxony (). The later rulers of the House of Wettin adopted the Ascanian coat-of-arms.

Since the Duke of Saxony was considered one of the prince-electors electing a new Holy Roman Emperor, there was an argument between the lines of Lauenburg and Wittenberg about who should cast Saxony's vote. In 1314 both lines found themselves on different sides in a double election. Eventually, the Dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg succeeded in 1356 after the promulgation of the Golden Bull. To distinguish him from other rulers bearing the title Duke of Saxony, he was commonly called "Elector of Saxony". 


In 1303 the brothers split their inheritance between them, however, only two brothers had heirs creating the "Bergedorf-Mölln" and the "Ratzeburg-Lauenburg" lines.

First named Saxe-Mölln, however, renamed after reorganising territory, including parts of Albert III's share in 1321. 


In 1401, the elder branch became extinct and Lauenburg rejoined the Ratzeburg-Lauenburg line.

First named Saxe-Bergedorf-Lauenburg, however, renamed after reorganising territory, including parts of Albert III's share in 1321. 


In 1401, the younger branch inherited Lauenburg and other possessions of the extinct elder Bergedorf-Mölln line.

The Ascanian Dynasty continued in Saxe-Lauenburg until 1689, but after the Lauenburg line had finally lost the Saxon Electorate to the Wittenberg line in 1356 and failed to obtain the succession in the Electorate after 1422, recognition of the Dukes of Saxe-Lauenburg as Dukes of Saxony waned.

For the predecessor see the section Ascanian or younger Duchy of Saxony above in this article.

The Albertines were a junior branch of the Wettin dynasty of Electors of Saxony (section below), who ruled in Northern Thuringia and Southern Meissen until they replaced the senior "Ernestine" branch as Electors and rulers of most Saxon territory in 1547.

Following their displacement by the Albertines, the Ernestine branch of the Wettins continued to rule in southern Thuringia as "Dukes of Saxony", but their lands eventually split up into many different tiny "Ernestine duchies". Of these, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Saxe-Meiningen, and Saxe-Altenburg lasted until 1918. This article does not list the subsequent Ernestine dukes.

The Golden Bull of 1356 confirmed the right to participate in the election of a Holy Roman Emperor to the Duke of Saxony in the Saxe-Wittenberg line. For the predecessor see the section Ascanian Dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg above in this article.

The Holy Roman Empire came to an end in 1806. The Elector of Saxony, allied to Napoleon I, anticipated its dissolution by becoming the ruler of an independent Kingdom of Saxony in 1806.

Saxony became a republic at the end of the German Empire in 1918. For later rulers, see List of Ministers-President of Saxony.

Strict weak ordering

Strict weak ordering is a binary relation on a set. Such relations define a strict ordering, but they contain several elements of the same type. An example might be the relation "costs less than", or "is cheaper than". For any two elements that are "of different types", the relation holds. On the other hand, there are some elements that cannot be ordered that way, because they are of the same type. An example for such a relation may be the relation, "costs less than": milk may "cost less than" bread, and bread may cost less than cake. Two items of different types may cost less than another, but they can otherwise have the same price. 

Two different algorithms that sort words by the number of letters in the word may not give the same ordering of the words with the same number of letters, but they will always give an ordering where the four-letter words come before the five-letter-words, and after the three-letter-words.

Time will give a strict weak ordering too; Events that are equivalent in the timeframe happen at the same time.

<doc id="278960" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=278960" title="Colour vision">
Colour vision

Colour vision is the capacity of an organism to distinguish objects based on the wavelengths (or frequencies) of the light they reflect, emit, or transmit. Colour is a quality constructed by the visual brain and not a property of objects. 

A 'red' apple does not emit red light. Rather, it simply absorbs all the frequencies of visible light shining on it except for a group of frequencies that are reflected.

It is these frequencies which are perceived as red. 

The nervous system derives colour by comparing the responses to light from the several types of cone photoreceptors in the eye. These cone photoreceptors are sensitive to different portions of the visible spectrum. 

For humans, the visible spectrum ranges approximately from 380 to 740 nm, and there are normally three types of cones. The visible range and number of cone types differ between species.

The advantage of colour vision is the better discrimination of surfaces it allows.

<doc id="278970" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=278970" title="Compound eye">
Compound eye

Compound eyes consist of many photoreceptor units or ommatidia. Each 'ommatidium' (singular) is an individual 'eye unit'. 

The image perceived is a combination of inputs from ommatidia on a convex surface. Thus they point in slightly different directions. 

Compared with simple eyes, compound eyes possess a wide-angle view. They can detect fast movement and, in some cases, the polarization of light. 

Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms, and 96% of animal species possess a complex optical system. Image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs, chordates and arthropods.

Almost all insects and arachnids use both simple and compound eyes.

Compound eyes fall into two groups: apposition eyes, which form multiple inverted images, and superposition eyes, which form a single erect image. Compound eyes are common in arthropods, and are also present in annelids and some bivalved molluscs.

Compound eyes, in arthropods at least, grow at their margins by the addition of new ommatidia.

Good fliers like flies or honey bees, or prey-catching insects like praying mantis or dragonflies, have specialized zones of ommatidia organized into a foveal area which gives acute vision. In the acute zone the eyes are flattened and the facets larger. The flattening allows more ommatidia to receive light from a spot and therefore higher resolution.

Another version is the pseudofaceted eye, as seen in Scutigera. This type of eye consists of a cluster of numerous ocelli on each side of the head, organized in a way that resembles a true compound eye.

The body of "Ophiocoma wendtii", a type of brittle star, is covered with ommatidia, turning its whole skin into a compound eye. The same is true of many chitons.

Opsins are the universal photoreceptor molecules of all visual systems in the animal kingdom. 

They change from a resting state to a signalling state by absorbing light. This activates the G protein, resulting in a signalling cascade which produces physiological responses. 

This process of capturing a photon and transforming it into a physiological response is known as phototransduction.

Five groups of opsins are involved in vision, mediating the conversion of a photon of light into an electrochemical signal, the first step in the visual transduction cascade.

Another opsin found in the mammalian retina, melanopsin, is involved in circadian rhythms and pupillary reflex but not in image-forming.

At the "Examiner", Bronstein specialized in investigations and was a foreign correspondent for eight years. He has won awards for his writing about the Philippines from the Overseas Press Club, Associated Press, the World Affairs Council and Media Alliance. He was named executive editor of the "Examiner" in 1991, having previously served as managing editor for news.

Bronstein was named executive vice president and editor of the "San Francisco Chronicle" in March 2003. He had been senior vice president and executive editor of the paper when Hearst Corp. bought The Chronicle. 

The newspaper had been selling fewer newspapers each year. In late March 2007, Bronstein called an emergency staff meeting and reportedly stated that the news business "is broken, and no one knows how to fix it." This meeting happened after several weeks of articles focused on the influence of the Internet and the blogosphere made front page headlines in the "Chronicle".

On January 23, 2008, Bronstein announced that he was leaving his job as editor of the Chronicle. He became editor-at-large with Hearst Newspapers.

He was married to actress Sharon Stone from February 1998 until January 2004. They adopted a son named Roan. Bronstein married again later. He lives in Mill Valley, CA with his wife and three kids.

In June 2001, he was seriously injured by a Komodo dragon. He entered its cage at the Los Angeles Zoo after being invited in by the dragon's keeper. Bronstein was bitten on his bare foot. He did not wear shoes because the zoo worker had told him to take them off. The shoes were white could have excited the dragon.

Since the television game show "Jeopardy!" started its run in 1964, there were various songs and arrangements that were used as the show's main theme, most of which were composed by Merv Griffin. The best known theme song is "Think!". It has served as the countdown music for the Final Jeopardy! round since 1964.

A jazz tune called "Take Ten" composed by Julian Griffin served as the main theme.

When the series was revived in 1978, "Frisco Disco" has served as the main theme, and "January, February, March" served as the opening theme. They also were used in the first pilot of the Alex Trebek-hosted version.

Beginning with the Alex Trebek hosted syndicated version in September 1984, a rendition of "Think!" served as the show's main theme. The original version of the main theme consisted of saxophones and synthesizers along with the original recording of "Think!" retained for the final segment. A swooshing sound effect was added during the show's introduction.

At the start of season 9, the main theme was remixed to include a bongo track.

At the start of Season 14 in the fall of 1997, a new version of both the main theme and "Think!", composed by Steve Kaplan, was introduced. The main theme involved a more piano-driven, orchestral, jazzy sound.

When the show aired episodes in Las Vegas, Nevada in February 2001, an updated version of the 1997 was introduced, with a faster tempo and more upbeat feel. It was then put permanently into use from the April 23, 2001 episode onward.

An all-new arrangement of both the main theme and "Think!" was introduced at the beginning of Season 25. It was composed by Chris Bell Music.

The Zoo has two campuses. The first is a urban park in northwest Washington, D.C.. It is 20 minutes from the National Mall by Metro. It offers family fun, excitement and interesting education programs. The other campus is the Smithsonian Conservation and Research Center (SCBI; formerly known as the Conservation and Research Center) in Front Royal, Virginia. SCBI is not open to the public. It is for training wildlife professionals in conservation biology and to propagating rare species through natural means and assisted reproduction. The National Zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums(AZA).

Altogether, the two facilities contain some 2,000 animals of 400 different species.<ref name="nationalzoo/AnimalIndex"> </ref> 

The National Zoo was created by an Act of Congress in 1889 for “the advancement of science and the instruction and recreation of the people.” In 1890 it became a part of the Smithsonian Institution. Three well-known individuals drew up plans for the Zoo: Samuel Langley, third Secretary of the Smithsonian; William T. Hornaday, noted conservationist and head of the Smithsonian's vertebrate division; and Frederick Law Olmsted, the premier landscape architect of his day. Together they designed a new zoo to exhibit animals for the public and to serve as a refuge for wildlife, such as bison and beaver, which were rapidly vanishing from North America.

The National Zoo has been the home to giant pandas for more than 30 years. First Hsing Hsing and Ling Ling in 1972, and, since 2000, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian. On July 9, 2005, Mei Xiang gave birth to Tai Shan, who went to China in February 2010.

The zoo is supported by taxes and is open to everyone. About 2 million people visit each year, according to the "Washington Post" in 2005.


Daily programs include animal training, feeding demonstrations, and talks by zoo workers. These are exhibits at the Zoo:

Manila Sound is a type of music that started in Manila, Philippines, from the last years of the 1960s to the middle of the 1970s. It is commonly known as the "bright side" of the time of President Ferdinand Marcos because of its cheerful words and was often used in protest to his dictatorship. 

This music type has affected all modern music types in the country as the beginner of Original Pilipino Music (OPM).

Manila Sound was made famous by a folk rock band called Hotdog. Their songs: ""Ikaw Ang Miss Universe Ng Buhay Ko"" (or "You Are the Miss Universe Of My Life"), ""'Manila'"", and ""Beh Buti Nga""; had catchy melody phrases common to the music type. Later, the singer-songwriter, Freddy Aguilar, used the music type with his music to express the suffering of the people. His song, "Bayan Ko", was popular in protests.

The music type is a mix of Filipino folk music and rock music added with some funk, light jazz, and disco, and is sung in both Tagalog and English languages.

The lyrics are childlike and often humorous caused by the disco fever in that period and in contrast to the oppression by Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos. It is sometimes described as "the marshmallow sound".

Princess Royal

Princess Royal is a title often given by the reigning British King or Queen to his or her eldest daughter. The title is a gift of the monarch, unlike Prince of Wales which is automatically given to the eldest son

There can only be one Princess Royal at a time, so Elizabeth II never held the title because her aunt, Princess Mary was already called Princess Royal.

The following is a complete list of women officially styled as "Princess Royal":

Princess Louisa Maria (1692–1712), the last daughter of King James II (d. 1701), was born after he lost his crown in the Glorious Revolution. She was given the title of "Princess Royal" during James's exile at Saint-Germain-en-Laye and was so called by Jacobites, even though she was never even James's eldest living daughter.

Before Charles II in 1660 started using the title of Princess Royal the eldest daughters of the King of England had a special status. The Magna Carta forced the Barons to pay for the eldest daughter's wedding , and later sleeping with her was made High Treason, punishable by death - a law only changed in 1998

Common Sense (pamphlet)

Common Sense is a pamphlet (short book) written by Thomas Paine. It was first published on January 10, 1776. Paine wrote the pamphlet to change the minds of people who wanted to peacefully settle their differences with the British government to fight for independence instead. The pamphlet said that the British government and other European monarchies were tyrannical, meaning they did not support the rights of people. He called the pamphlet "Common Sense" because he wrote that it was against common sense for an island to rule a larger nation. Therefore, the colonies should overthrow the British government.

The pamphlet was one of the bestselling works of the 18th century in America. Thomas Paine wrote in a style that was easy for most people to understand, instead of the hard to understand writing common in the Enlightenment Era. He also referenced the Bible and used idioms that many of the Protestant colonists understood.

The document was an important part of the American Revolutionary War. It lead to the Declaration of Independence, which the Second Continental Congress wrote and signed into law later that year. "Common Sense" helped by creating mass support for the American Revolution.

Jeopardy!

Jeopardy! is an American television game show created by Merv Griffin. The show first appeared on NBC, where it was hosted by Art Fleming from March 30, 1964 to January 3, 1975 and again from October 2, 1978 to March 2, 1979. Beginning on September 10, 1984 and continuing into the present, the show is in syndicated format and is hosted by Alex Trebek. Versions of the show have been made in many foreign countries throughout the world.

Since the syndicated version premiered, the show has won the most Emmy Awards of any game show on daytime television. In 2001, "TV Guide" named it the second-best game show of all time.

Unlike regular trivia games, the answers are given as clues, and contestants come up with questions as a response. For example, a clue would be "One of our Founding fathers, he was our first president", and the response would be "Who is George Washington?". The game of "Jeopardy!" consists of three rounds: the Jeopardy! round, the Double Jeopardy! round, and the Final Jeopardy! round. In the Jeopardy! round, there are six categories with five clues in each, ranging from $200 to $1000. One of the clues is a Daily Double, in which a contestant may wager up to $1000 or the amount of his or her cash winnings. The Double Jeopardy! round is similar to the Jeopardy! round, but the clues are worth double the amount. And there are two Daily Doubles instead of one. The Final Jeopardy round consists of just one category and one clue. During the commercial break, players write their wagers based in their knowledge on the given category. After the commercial break, the host reads the clue. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses, again in the form of a question. During this time the lights dim, and the "Think!" theme plays in the background. The player with the most money at the end of the game keeps his or her winnings and returns to the next show. Second-place contestants receive a $2000 cash prize, and third place contestants receive a $1000 cash prize.

Since the series debut in 1964, there were different songs that served as the show's main theme. Since 1984, a rendition of the show's most famous theme, "Think!", has also been used as the main theme. 

Like the theme music, the "Jeopardy!" set changed over the years. The original gameboard was exposed behind a curtain. The clues were printed on clue cards, which were revealed as a contestant asked for a particular clue and its value. In 1978, the cards were dropped in favor of flipping panels which had the dollar value on one side and the clue on the other. Also, the curtain was replaced with double-slide panels. When the show returned in 1984, the gameboard was changed again. This time it featured 30 television monitors for each clue in the categories. In 1991, the original monitors were replaced with larger monitors. In 2006, the monitors were replaced with a nearly seamless projection video wall. Then in 2009, the video wall was replaced by 36 HD flat-panel monitors.

Other changes to the set have been made since the premiere of the syndicated version. Starting in 1985 and continuing until 1997, the sets were designed to have a blue background for the Jeopardy! round and a red background for the Double Jeopardy! and Final Jeopardy! rounds; however, starting in 2005 and continuing into the present, the background color changes to red when the lights dim during Final Jeopardy! In November 1996, two months after the start of Season 13, a new set designed by Naomi Slodki was introduced. In November 2002, another new set designed by Slodki was introduced. This set was slightly modified in 2006 when "Jeopardy!" started broadcasting in high-definition.

A new set debuted with the Tournament of Champions and Celebrity Jeopardy! taped in 2009 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. This new set became the primary set at the start of Season 26 in the fall of 2009.

Anton Babchuk

Anton Anatoliiovych Babchuk (; born May 6, 1984) is a Ukrainian-Russian professional ice hockey defenceman currently playing for Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League (NHL).

Originally from Kiev, Ukraine, Babchuk began playing hockey at the age of three. He began his training with the Sokil Kyiv junior hockey affiliate, a team which included fellow future Ukrainian NHLer Nikolai Zherdev. While participating in an overseas peewee tournament in Quebec, Canada, Babchuk's team found itself competing against a team from Elektrostal, Russia. The rival team's coach, Ravil Iskakhov, took note of both Babchuk and Zherdev, and invited the pair to further their development with the Elemash Elektrostal hockey club of the Russian Major League, to which they accepted together. 

He was drafted into the National Hockey League (NHL) 21st overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2002 Entry Draft. Babchuk made his North American debut with the Blackhawks affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals of the American Hockey League (AHL), in the 2003–04 season. Babchuk also made his NHL debut by seasons end, appearing in five games with the Blackhawks. 

In the 2005–06 season, Babchuk was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes for Danny Richmond on January 20, 2006. Babchuk scored his first goal for the Hurricanes on January 28, 2006. He was also named second star of the game. Babchuk played in 22 games with the Hurricanes for the season and was a part of the extended squad of the Hurricanes as they became the Stanley Cup Champions.

In the 2006–07 season, on February 6, 2007, the Hurricanes activated František Kaberle from injury, forcing them to send Babchuk down to the Albany River Rats. Babchuk was the only possible defenceman they could send down because he was the only one on the Hurricanes' roster that was not subject to waiver wire claims. The next day, Carolina announced that they had suspended Babchuk because of his refusal to report to Albany. In 2007–08, Babchuk played in the Russian Superleague (RSL) for Avangard Omsk. 

On July 1, 2008, Babchuk re-signed with the Hurricanes to a one-year contract for the 2008–09 season. He led all Hurricanes' defensemen with 16 goals in 72 games. Following a contract dispute that lead to him requesting a trade out of Carolina, Babchuk turned back to Russia on 19 September 2009, re-signing with Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) club Avangard Omsk. During the very first training day in Omsk, he broke the ice rink glass with a shot at Arena Omsk.
Babchuk was chosen to play on Team Yashin at the 2nd Kontinental Hockey League All-Star Game.

On July 1, 2010, Babchuk again re-signed with the Carolina Hurricanes to a one-year contract for the 2010-2011 season. This contract was worth 1.4 million US dollars.

On November 17, 2010, Babchuk was traded along with Tom Kostopoulos to the Calgary Flames for Ian White and Brett Sutter.

Geography of Taiwan

Taiwan is a medium-sized chain of islands in East Asia located at 23°30" N, 121°00" E . It runs through the Tropic of Cancer. Also known as Formosa, it makes up most of the territories of the Republic of China (commonly known as Taiwan).
The island of Formosa (or Taiwan) was formed about 4.5 million years ago from a Geosyncline. It is part of an island arc. It was formed when the Eurasian Plate slid under an old chain of volcanic islands in the Philippine Mobile Belt. At the northern end of the island, the Philippine Mobile Belt sank under the Eurasian Plate.
The main island of the chain of islands, which is made of 99% of the Republic of China. The other 1% is made up of smaller islands like Orchard Island and the Penghu Islands islands, along with far smaller islands. The chain is separated from mainland China by the Taiwan Strait which is 220 kilometers long. 

The climate on the island is mostly ocean-like and changes very widely. The south end of the island is humid (very watery) During the summer, typhoons are very common. Most of the time, there are four each year. 

The terrain of the island changes a lot. In the west, plains and grasslands are common. 90% of the population lives in the west. The highest point on Formosa is Jade Mountain at 3951.798 meters tall in the year 2003. 

In the east of the island is mountainous terrain with thick forests and endemic (native-only) types of plants and animals such as the Formasan Black Bear and the Formosan Cypress. Many of these species are now endangered or extinct. 

See also: List of mountains in Taiwan, List of Endemic Species in Taiwan

There are many mountain ranges on the island of Formosa. 

The few natural resources are gold, copper, coal, natural gas, limestone, marble, and asbestos. The island is 55% forest, 24% farmable lands, 15% miscellaneous, 5% pastures, and 1% crops. 

Earthquakes are the main natural hazards (problems). More than 2,000 people have died from earthquakes. The main environmental problems are air pollution and water pollution.

Charles Edward Stuart

Prince Charles Edward Louis Philip Casimir Stuart (31 December 1720 - 31 January 1788) commonly known as Bonnie Prince Charlie or The Young Pretender was the Jacobite pretender to the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland. This claim was as the eldest son of James Francis Edward Stuart, and grandson of James II and VII. Charles is perhaps best known as the leading the unsuccessful Jacobite uprising of 1745, where he led an rebellion which ended in a defeat at the Battle of Culloden that effectively ended the Jacobite cause. Charles's escape from Scotland after the uprising has rendered him a romantic figure of heroic failure in later representations, for example in "The Skye Boat Song".

He lived, and died, in Rome, where his father had been given a home by the Pope - Clement XI.

Henry Benedict Stuart

Henry Benedict Maria Clement Thomas Francis Xavier Stuart (11 March 1725 - 13 July 1807) was a Roman Catholic Cardinal, as well as the fourth and final Jacobite heir to publicly claim the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Unlike his father, James Francis Edward Stuart, and brother, Charles Edward Stuart, Henry made no effort to seize the throne. After Charles's death in January 1788 the Pope did not recognise Henry as the lawful ruler of England, Scotland and Ireland, but referred to him as the Cardinal Duke of York.

He spent his life in the Papal States and had a long career in the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church, rising to become the Dean of the College of Cardinals and Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia and Velletri. At the time of his death he was (and still is) one of the longest serving Cardinals in the Church's history.

When he was young, Henry's father made him Duke of York (in the Jacobite peerage), and that was how he was best known. Upon the death of his brother in 1788 Henry became known by Jacobites, and within his personal entourage, as Henry IX of England, although publicly he referred to himself as Cardinal-Duke of York "nuncupatus".

Henry was born in exile at Rome on 6 March 1725 and baptized on the same day by Pope Benedict XIII, 37 years after his grandfather James II and VII lost the throne, and ten years after his father's failed attempt to regain it. His father was James Francis Edward Stuart, known to his opponents as "the Old Pretender". His mother was the Princess Maria Klementyna Sobieska, granddaughter of the Polish King, John III Sobieski.

Henry went to France in 1745 to help his brother, Prince Charles Edward Stuart ("Bonnie Prince Charlie", or "the Young Pretender") prepare the Jacobite campaign of that year. After its defeat, Henry Stuart returned to Italy. On 30 June 1747 Pope Benedict XIV conferred him with tonsure and created him Cardinal-Deacon of "S. Maria in Portico" in special consistory held on the 3 July 1747. On 27 August 1747 he was promoted to the four minor orders by the Pope. He received the subdiaconate on 18 August 1748 and diaconate on 25 August 1748. He was ordained priest on 1 September 1748 and consecrated titular Archbishop of Corinth on 2 October 1758.

He was made Cardinal Priest in 1748, and Cardinal-Bishop of Frascati on 13 July 1761. When he became the senior cardinal "Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals" on 26 September 1803, he transferred to the See of Ostia and Velletri.

At one point Henry was very rich, 
At the time of the French Revolution, he lost the land and income he was given by the French king, and spent a lot of his money helping Pope Pius VI. This, in addition to the seizure of his Frascati property by the French, caused him to descend into poverty. The British Minister in Venice arranged for Henry to receive an annuity of £4,000 from King George III of Great Britain. Although the British government said this as an act of charity, Henry and the Jacobites called it to be a first installment on the money which was legally owed to him. (For many years the British government had promised to return the English dowry of his grandmother, Mary of Modena, but had never did.)

Henry returned to Frascati in 1803. In September of that year he became the Dean of the College of Cardinals and hence Cardinal Bishop of Ostia and Velletri, though he still lived in the episcopal palace at Frascati. He died there on 13 July 1807, aged 82.

Henry was the last claimant to the English throne to touch for the King's Evil.

Under his will, which he signed as "Henry R", he was succeeded in all his claimed British rights by his friend and nearest blood-relative, Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia. But Charles never claimed or denied his Jacobite claims, nor have any of his successors to this day.

Contrary to popular belief, he did not leave the Crown Jewels to the Prince of Wales, afterwards George IV of the United Kingdom. All his property was entrusted to Monsignor Angelo Cesarini, for distribution. Cesarini sent the Prince of Wales several jewels from Henry's private collection. These included a "[Lesser George" insignia (thought to have been worn by Charles I at his execution, and now at Windsor Castle) and a St Andrew's Cross (now at Edinburgh Castle), which is an insignia of the order of the Thistle, and also a ruby ring.

Henry Benedict, his brother, his father and his mother are buried in the crypt of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. There is a monument to the Royal Stuarts designed by Antonio Canova in the basilica to their memory on one of the columns in the basilica proper. It was recently restored, paid for by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.

He was a cardinal elector in the papal conclaves of 1758, 1769, 1774-75 and 1799-1800.

Now "Urbi et Orbi" refers to a papal address and Apostolic Blessing that is addressed to the City of Rome and to the entire world from the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. Usually they are only given at Christmas and Easter, but also the first speech of a new pope is Urbi et Orbi, and sometimes one is given to special gatherings of pilgrims in Rome and during Holy Years

The blessing after the speech is given in Latin, and usually many other languages too.

Bill Ranford

William Edward Ranford (born December 14, 1966 in Brandon, Manitoba) is a former professional ice hockey goaltender. He graduated from New Westminster Secondary School in 1985. He was selected in the third round of the 1985 NHL Entry Draft, 52nd overall, by the Boston Bruins. Over the course of fifteen NHL seasons, Ranford would play with Boston, the Edmonton Oilers, Washington Capitals, Tampa Bay Lightning, and Detroit Red Wings, winning two Stanley Cups, a Canada Cup, and the 1994 Hockey World Championships while playing for Canada.

As a child, Ranford took figure skating lessons, before eventually decided to go into goaltending. Because his father was in the armed forces, Ranford lived in Germany for a few years, as well as various places in Canada. He played for local teams in Portage La Prairie, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island and Red Deer, Alberta. 

Ranford spent his junior career with the New Westminster Bruins, playing two seasons with the team before being drafted by the Boston Bruins in the 3rd round (52nd overall) in the 1985 NHL Entry Draft.. 

Ranford's post-draft year, 1985–86, was an eventful one, as Ranford was named to the WHL Second All-Star Team, and saw his first NHL action after the WHL season ended, winning three of four games for Boston, before going 0–2 in the playoffs. 

To start the next year, Boston assigned him to the Moncton Golden Flames of the AHL, where he went 3–0 to start the season, and wound up spending the rest of the year with Boston. The replacement of Bruins coach Butch Goring with Terry O'Reilly led to Ranford falling out of favour, and eventually being dealt on March 8, 1988 from the Boston Bruins with Geoff Courtnall to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Andy Moog. 

Following the trade, he spent most of the next season with the AHL's Maine Mariners, but that would be the last time he would play at the minor-league level.

Ranford won his first Stanley Cup in 1988, as the backup to Grant Fuhr. However, in 1990 despite constant comparisons to the injured Fuhr, Ranford emerged as a first-rate goaltender, leading the Oilers to the Stanley Cup and winning the Conn Smythe Trophy (playoff MVP) in the process. It was the last cup that the Edmonton Oilers dynasty would win. Ranford went on to play the next six seasons in Edmonton, before being dealt back to the Boston Bruins on January 11, 1996 for Mariusz Czerkawski, Sean Brown, and a 1st Round Pick in the 1996 Entry Draft (Matthieu Descoteaux).

After less than two seasons with Boston, Ranford was dealt to the Washington Capitals on March 1, 1997 with Adam Oates and Rick Tocchet for Jason Allison, Anson Carter, Jim Carey, a conditional draft pick in the 1998 Entry Draft, and a 3rd Round Pick in the 1997 Entry Draft (Lee Goren). In 1998 the Washington Capitals advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, it was Ranfords third trip to the finals. On June 18, 1998, he was dealt to the Tampa Bay Lightning for a 2nd Round Pick in the 1999 Entry Draft and a 3rd Round Pick in the 1998 Entry Draft (Todd Hornung).

He began the season with the Tampa Bay Lightning, but was traded to the Detroit Red Wings on March 23, 1999 for a conditional draft pick. It was the second deal between the Tampa Bay Lightning and the Detroit Red Wings that day. The prior trade brought Wendel Clark and a draft pick to the Detroit Red Wings and Goaltender Kevin Hodson and a draft pick to the Tampa bay Lightning. The Wendel Clark trade made the Bill Ranford deal happen.

His final year in the NHL was 2000, where Ranford returned to Edmonton as a free-agent backing up Tommy Salo before announcing his retirement on April 24.

Ranford acted in the movie "Miracle", performing the on-ice scenes as the goaltender for Team USA, Jim Craig, while Eddie Cahill performed the off-ice scenes. Ranford also played net for the Edmonton Oilers alumni team at the Heritage Classic, the first outdoor regular season game in NHL history. Ranford (14 saves) and Grant Fuhr (11 saves) took turns in goal and held the Montreal Canadiens alumni team scoreless in a 2–0 victory. 

Bill served as the Goalie Coach for the WHL Vancouver Giants for the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 seasons. 

On July 10, 2006 he was named the goaltending coach of the Los Angeles Kings and continues to hold that position.

He is also a part-owner of the Coquitlam Express of the British Columbia Hockey League (Tier II Junior).

Sargon II (Akkadian: Šarru-kên, "legitimate king", reigned 722 – 705 BC) was an Assyrian king. Sargon II became co-regent with Shalmaneser V in 722 BC. Shalmaneser V died in 722 BC. From then on, Sargon II was the only ruler of Assyria. It is not clear if he was the son of Tiglath-Pileser III or a usurper unrelated to the royal family. In his inscriptions, he styles himself as a new man and rarely talks about his predecessors. He nevertheless took the name "Sharru-kinu" ("true king"), after Sargon of Akkad — who had founded the first Semitic Empire in the region about 16 centuries earlier. "Sargon" is the Biblical form of the name.

Servant of God

Servant of God is a title given to individuals by different religions, but in general the phrase is used to describe a person believed to be pious in his or her faith tradition. In the Catholic Church, it designates someone who is being investigated by the Church for possibly being recognized as a saint. In the Eastern Orthodox churches, this term is used to refer to any Eastern Orthodox Christian. 

The Arabic name Abdullah عبد الله, the Hebrew name Obadiah עובדיה and the German name Gottschalk literally mean "servant of God".

"Servant of God" is the title given to a deceased person of the Catholic Church whose life and works are being investigated in consideration for official recognition by the Pope and the Catholic Church as a saint in Heaven.
The process for canonization is under the jurisdiction of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. 

The title "Servant of God" () should not be confused with "Servus Servorum Dei" (Servant of the Servants of God), one of the titles of the Pope.

Receiving the title "Servant of God" is the first of the four steps in the canonization process. The next step is being declared "Venerable", upon a decree of heroicity or martyrdom by the honored. This is followed by beatification, with the title of "Blessed", after the confirmation of miracles attributed to the honored. The final step is canonization, where the honored would receive the title of "Saint".


</doc>
<doc id="279359" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=279359" title="Venerable">
Venerable

The Venerable is used as a style in several Christian churches. It is also the common English-language translation of a number of Buddhist titles.

In the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, "The Venerable," is the style used for a person who has been posthumously declared "heroic in virtue" during the investigation and process leading to possible canonization as a saint. Before a person is considered to be "venerable," he or she must be declared as such by a proclamation, approved by the Pope, of having lived a life that was "heroic in virtue" – the virtues being the Theological Virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the Cardinal Virtues of prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. The next step is beatification, at which point the person is referred to as "The Blessed", and finally canonization, at which point the person is referred to as "Saint". Two modern and well-known examples of those who have been declared venerable are Popes John Paul II and Pius XII, who were both declared venerable by Pope Benedict XVI in December 2009, and who are likely to be beatified soon.

The 7-8th-century English monk St. Bede was referred to as being "venerable" soon after his death and, by tradition, is therefore often referred to as "the Venerable Bede" despite his also having been canonized. St Bede was the first person to be recorded as "The Venerable".

Pedro Álvares Cabral (c. 1467 or 1468 Belmonte – c. 1520 Santarém) was a Portuguese nobleman, navigator and explorer who was the first European to see Brazil (on 22 April 1500).

King Manuel I of Portugal sent Cabral on an expedition to India. 
Cabral sailed on 9 March 1500, with 13 ships, following the route of Vasco da Gama. 
On 22 April 1500, he sighted land (Brazil), claiming it for the Portuguese Crown and naming it the "Island of the True Cross." 
King Manuel I renamed this land "Holy Cross"; it was later renamed once again, to "Brazil", after a kind of wood found there, called pau-brasil. 

Cabral stayed in Brazil for 10 days and then continued on his way to India, in a dangerous trip with storms, and he suffered the destruction of some ships at the Cape of Good Hope, and fighting against Muslim traders in Calicut, India (50 men of Cabral were killed in this attack). 

Cabral successfully traded for spices in Cochin, now called Kozhikode, India (in early January, 1501). 

Cabral returned to Portugal on 23 June 1501, with only 5 of the original 13 ships, carrying a big load of spices.

After this journey, King Manuel I appointed Vasco da Gama to head the next expedition (1502) because Cabral refused to command another expedition to India.

Cabral retired to his properties in Santarém. He died in c. 1520 and was buried in a monastery in Santarém, Portugal.

Typhoon Mike

Super Typhoon Mike (international designation: 9025, JTWC designation: 27W, PAGASA name: Ruping) was the strongest and deadliest typhoon of the 1990 Pacific typhoon season as it crossed the Philippines in November.

An area of persistent convection over the Caroline Islands was first noted in the Significant Tropical Weather Advisory on November 6. As it headed westward, its outflow rapidly improved, with banding and a more circular cloud pattern. The organization continued, and it was upgraded to Tropical Depression 27W on the 7th. Early on the 8th, the depression strengthened to Tropical Storm Mike near the island of Yap.

Mike continued its westward movement and its intensification rate, and became a typhoon early on November 9, the 18th of the season. At this time, a weakness in the subtropical ridge, which kept the storm on its westward movement, was bring Mike northward. This did not occur, and Mike kept its persistent westward motion. On November 10, the typhoon rapidly intensified, reaching peak winds of 165 mph later that day. In a 48-hour period, the typhoon deepened 99 millibars to a minimum central pressure of 915 mb.

Mike retained its intensity of 165 mph winds for a day as it approached the Philippines. Fortunately for the archipelago, the combination of an eyewall replacement cycle and land interaction to its west weakened the super typhoon. Nevertheless, Mike still hit the eastern Philippines as a 140 mph typhoon on November 12. The typhoon further weakened to an 85 mph typhoon while crossing the islands, but in the South China Sea, conditions favored slight strengthening.

Mike reached a secondary peak of 95 mph winds on November 14, but land interaction with Vietnam again weakened it to a minimal typhoon. The forecast break in the subtropical ridge finally occurred on the 15th, causing a northwest motion. Vertical shear increased, weakening Mike to a tropical storm on the 16th. Early the next day, the storm passed over western Hainan Island, and degraded to a tropical depression that night. After a brief passage over the Gulf of Tonkin Mike hit southern China where it dissipated on November 18.

While crossing the western Caroline Islands, Mike proved to be quite destructive. Extensive damage occurred to the islands, but no deaths occurred and only one injury was reported.

The Philippines did not fare so well. The typhoon's heavy rainfall produced mudslides which, combined with the heavy wind damage, resulted in over $14 million in damage (1990 USD, $20.8 million 2005 USD). Over 748 people were reported killed, making Mike the most destructive typhoon for the Philippines since Typhoon Ike in 1984, which killed over 1,000 people. President Corazon Aquino declared a state of calamity in the Visayas.

Typhoon Mike's damage to the infrastructure of the city and province of Cebu forced its local leaders to rethink governmental priorities. A conscious effort to rebuild after the damage was promoted, resulting into the boom of the economy of Cebu, dubbed CEBOOM.

Due to the destruction in the Philippines, the name Mike was retired and was replaced by Manny. Its PAGASA name, Ruping, was also retired.

Negative feedback

Negative feedback is a basic concept of cybernetics; it is the basis of regulation and control. It is important in engineering and physiology. In biology and physiology negative feedback is known as homeostasis.

Negative feedback occurs when the output of a system acts to oppose changes to the input of a system. This has the result that the changes are made less, and the system kept within limits. The classic example is a central heating system which cuts off when a (suitably placed) temperature sensor hits a pre-set mark. The negative feedback part is the thermostat.

Virtually all aspect of living systems involve homeostasis, and disease follows when any of these systems fail. Examples: blood pressure, glucose level, liver functions, cell division, and so on.

Homeostasis was defined by Claude Bernard and later by Walter Bradford Cannon in 1926, 1929 and 1932 is the property of a system, either open or closed, that regulates its internal environment and tends to maintain a stable, constant condition. The concept came from that of "milieu interieur" which was created by Claude Bernard and published in 1865. 
If the overall feedback of the system is negative, then the system will tend to be stable.

The La Brea tar pits (or Rancho La Brea) are a famous cluster of tar pits in central Los Angeles. Many thousands of complete skeletons of large animals have been found here. They date mostly from 40,000 years ago to 8,000ya. 

Hancock Park was formed around the tar pits, in the heart of Los Angeles. Asphalt or tar ("brea" in Spanish) has seeped up from the ground here for tens of thousands of years. The tar is often covered with water. Over many centuries, animals that came to drink the water fell in, sank in the tar, and were preserved as bones. The George C. Page Museum is dedicated to researching the tar pits and displaying specimens from the animals that died there. The La Brea Tar Pits are now a registered National Natural Landmark.

Among the large mammals found there are Among the prehistoric species associated with the La Brea Tar Pits are mammoths, American mastodons, American lion, American cheetah, dire wolves, short-faced bears, ground sloths, and the state fossil of California, the saber-toothed cat, "Smilodon californicus". Only one human has ever been found, a partial skeleton of a woman, dated at approximately 9,000 BP who was apparently a victim of a homicide based on skull crush evidence .

It has 15 books overall: the first series "Deltora Quest" has eight books, the second series "Deltora Shadowlands" has three books, and the third series "Dragons of Deltora" has four books. They are all about a group of three friends who try to defeat the evil Shadow Lord and his friends.

Lief is the son of King Endon and Sharn, who went into hiding disguised as Jarred and Anna before their son was born. Lief was raised as a blacksmith's son in the run-down city of Del after the invasion. On his 16th birthday he set off on the Deltora Quest to find the seven gems of Deltora. In the ends he finds out that he is the heir to the throne and becomes the King of Deltora. At the end of the third series he marries Jasmine and has three children.

Barda is a strong bearded man. Before the invasion of the Shadow Lord, he was a guard of the Palace, but then he fled because his mother Min was killed, so he made friends with Endon and Sharn, and pretended to be a beggar for sixteen years, and always guarded Lief when he was in trouble. He accompanied Lief to find the seven gems of the Belt of Deltora. At the end of the last series he married Linden of Broome.

Jasmine is the daughter of Jarred (Doom) and Anna. She was born in the Forests of Silence, but when she was 7, her parents got taken away by Grey Guards. She lived as an orphan, with Kree and Filli for company. She met Lief and Barda in the Forests of Silence, and helped them get the first jewel, the topaz. After that, her mother Anna appeared to her in spirit form (because the topaz lets you come into contact with the dead)and told Jasmine to travel with Lief and Barda to find the jewels. At the end of the third series she married Lief and had three children.

Kree is a raven who used to live in Thaegan's territory, but Thaegen killed his parents so he fled to the Forests of Silence where he met Jasmine. He is very affectionate to Jasmine.

On the north edge is the Solomon Islands, and in the south it joins the Tasman Sea. The Great Barrier Reef is in the Coral Sea. It has a warm climate, it often rains and there are often tropical cyclones. It covers an area of about four times the size of Great Britain. The WWF describe the Coral Sea as being one of the last complete tropical wilderness areas on earth. It has beautiful coral reefs with many different sea creatures including grey and white tip reef sharks, hammerheads, manta rays, tuna, barracuda, turtles, whales and the rare nautilus.

Australia claims many of the islands as part of its 780,000 square kilometre Coral Sea Islands Territory. Most of them are small coral or sand islands, and only one has people living on it. This is Willis Island which is used as a weather station with a population of only four.

In World War II the Battle of the Coral Sea was the first aircraft carrier battle fought between the United States and Australia against Japan. The battle lasted from 4 May to 8 May 1942. During that time none of the ships saw each other of fired any of their guns at each other. All the fighting was done by aircraft from the carriers. It is the largest naval battle fought near Australia. It was important because it was the first major defeat for Japan, and it stopped the Japanese from invading Port Moresby, the capital city of New Guinea.

The Gulf of Carpentaria () is a large, shallow sea surrounded on three sides by northern Australia. Its north edge is the Arafura Sea; the sea between Australia and New Guinea. At its mouth, the Gulf is 590 km wide, and further south, 675 km. The north south distance is more than 700 km. It covers a water area of about 300,000 km². The gulf is between 55 and 66 meters deep, although there are spots as deep as 82 meters. In the last ice age the Gulf would have been dry land.

The land around the Gulf is generally flat and low-lying. To the west is Arnhem Land, the Top End of the Northern Territory, and Groote Eylandt, the largest island in the Gulf. To the east is the Cape York Peninsula. The area to the south, is a part of Queensland) called the Gulf Country or simply "the Gulf."

The climate is hot and humid with two seasons per year. The dry season lasts from about April until November and is has very dry southeast to east winds, caused by winter high pressure systems to the south. The wet season lasts from December to March. Most of the year's rainfall is happens in these months, and many low-lying areas are flooded. The Gulf is also a breeding ground for tropical cyclones from November and April.

In September and October the Morning Glory cloud appears in the Southern Gulf. The best place to see this is in the Burketown area shortly after dawn.

The first known European person to visit the area was the Dutch Willem Janszoon "(whose name is also written as Jansz)" in his 1606 voyage. Jan Carstenszoon (or "Carstensz"), visited in 1623 and named the Gulf after Pieter de Carpentier, who was the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Abel Tasman also explored the coast in 1644. The area was later explored and mapped by Matthew Flinders in 1802 and 1803.

The first overland expedition to reach the Gulf was the Burke and Wills expedition, led by Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills. They left Melbourne in August 1860 and reached the Bynoe River in February 1861.

Heinrich Anton de Bary (26 January 1831 – 19 January 1888) was a German surgeon, botanist, microbiologist, and mycologist (fungal systematics and physiology). 

He is considered a founding father of plant pathology (phytopathology) as well as the founder of modern mycology. His extensive and careful studies of the life history of fungi and contribution to the understanding of algae and higher plants were landmarks of biology.

De Bary studied the formation of lichens, the association between a fungus and an alga. He traced the stages through which they grew and reproduced and the adaptations which enabled them to survive drought and winter. He coined the word 'symbiosis' in 1879 in his monograph as "the living together of unlike organisms". He carefully studied the morphology of moulds, yeasts, and fungi and he established mycology as an independent science. 

de Bary was one of the first people to do research on slime moulds (Myxomycetes). He published a key paper in 1859, and later a book on the subject.

Systematics

Systematics is one of the main fields in biology. It is closely related to taxonomy.

Systematics is the study of the diversification of life on the planet Earth, both past and present, and the relationships among living things through time. 

Relationships are usually seen as evolutionary trees (cladograms, phylogenetic trees, phylogenies). 

Phylogenies have two components, "branching order" (showing group relationships) and "branch length" (showing amount of evolution). Phylogenetic trees of species and higher taxa are used to study the evolution of traits (anatomical or molecular characteristics), and the distribution of organisms (biogeography). Systematics is used to help us understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth.

"Systematic biology" and "taxonomy" are terms that are often confused and used interchangeably. They were defined as follows:
Systematics is the field which (a) provides scientific names for organisms, (b) describes them, (c) preserves collections of them, (d) provides classifications for the organisms, keys for their identification, and data on their distributions, (e) investigates their evolutionary histories, and (f) considers their environmental adaptations. Taxonomy is that part of systematics concerned with topics (a) to (d) above.

Protesting against the War in Vietnam, American "hippies" could use poetry, songs, sittings and other non traditional demonstration techniques.
In 1993, Act Up-Paris put a gigantic pink condom on the Concord Obelisk. It was Land art in a way. And it rose interest in France about VIH infection risks. In Mexico the "intergalactic" anonymous Chiapas mouvement used "phony icons", like sub-commander Marcos to attract attention from the media.

In some cases, Paris in 2003 for instance, artivists were arrested for acts of political art that verged on property destruction. A typical short term goal of artivists is to reclaim public space, especially by subvertising or destroying ads in urban areas or city transportation systems. Nevertheless artivists engage in different media like the internet not only for actions which could be described as hacktivism.

Often the acts of artivists can be refererred to as part of the larger concept of Culture jamming.

Artivists are often found in Social center.

Tiger Salamander

The Tiger Salamander is species of Mole Salamander. The right name of this type of salamander is the Eastern Tiger Salamander, , to differentiate from other closely related species.
Eastern tiger salamanders are big, with a normal length of 6–8 inches (15–20 cm). They can grow up to 14 inches (36 cm) in length. Grown-ups are usually spotted with grey, green, or black, and have large eyes. They have short mouths, big necks, strong legs, and long tails. They eat small insects and worms. Sometimes, grown ups eat small frogs and baby mice

Adults are almost never seen in open fields and often live in holes that are usually 2 feet from the top. Tiger salamanders almost always stay on land as adults, and usually only return to the water to lay eggs. But also they live in both land and water. They also like to swim, even if they are on land. They also are good swimmers. Like all ambystomatids, they are extremely loyal to their birthplace, and will travel long distances to go back. However, a single tiger salamander has only a 50% chance of laying eggs more than once in its lifetime. Males bump a female to initiate mating, and then deposit a spermatophore on the lake bottom. The female picks up the packet and deposits the now-fertilized eggs on vegetation. Large-scale captive breeding of Tiger salamanders has not been accomplished, for unknown reasons.

The larvae are entirely aquatic, and are characterized by large gills on the outside and a big tail fin that begins just behind the head. Arms are grown within a short time of coming out of their egg. Some larvae, especially in pools that are here one season and gone the next and in the north, may metamorphose as soon as feasible. These are known as small morph adults. Other larvae, especially in ancestral pools and warmer climates, may not metamorphose until fully adult size. These large larvae are usually known as waterdogs, and are used many times in the fishing bait and pet trade. Some populations may not metamorphose at all, and become sexually mature while in their larval form. These are the neotenes, and are particularly common where terrestrial conditions are bad.

While remaining common in many places, Tiger Salamander numbers have gone down compared with old levels. One of the largest threats to Tiger Salamander populations is wetland (habitat) destruction and/or changing. Since they tend to breed in semipermanent wetlands, baby Tiger Salamanders often experience mass deaths in association with pond drying. Fishes that have moved to their ponds have also been known to reduce, and levels they also experience reduced growth and longer larval periods. The effect of agricultural pesticides in urine disruption has also been researched. All of these issues have changed Tiger Salamander populations. However, Tiger Salamanders are only listed as endangered in Delaware, New York, New Jersey and Maryland; protected in Arizona; and of special concern in both North and South Carolina. (http://www.amphibiaweb.org) In November 2001, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the Great Lakes number of the Tiger Salamander as being removed, and the Southern Mountain population in British Columbia's Okanagan as endangered in Canada. Tiger salamander adults are also often sold as pets, or used in research. Nearly all such salamanders are wild-caught.

The California Tiger Salamander (Ambystoma californiense), the Barred Tiger Salamander (Ambystoma mavortium), and the Plateau Tiger Salamander (Ambystoma velasci), were all once subspecies of A. tigrinum, but are now separate species. Genetic studies made it right to break up the first A. tigrinum population, even though there is some hybridization between groups.

The Axolotl is also a relative of the Tiger Salamander. Axolotls live in a neotenous state, keeping most characteristics of their larval stage for their entire lifespan. While they never change under natural conditions, metamorphosis can be programmed in them, resulting in a form very similar to the Mexican Tiger Salamander. This is not, however, their natural condition, and shortens their lifespan by a lot.

When a lot of African Americans moved to the south from the 1960s and onwards, it was called the New Great Migration. In 1963 to 2000, data shows the movement of African Americans back to the South following de-industrialization in Northeastern and Midwestern cities, the growth of good jobs in the South, and better racial relations.

By 1845, it was the most popular and most bought daily newspaper in the United States. In 1861, it had sold about 84,000 copies and called itself "the most largely circulated journal in the world." Bennett said that the point of newspapers "is not to instruct but to startle." Bennett's politics, which influenced the articles in the Herald, tended to be anti-Catholic, but he was not particularly anti-immigrant as like most people who did not like the Catholics in New York at the time. During the American Civil War, it was a staunch supporter of the Democratic Party. When the Herald was still controlled by Bennett, it was considered to be the most sensationalist of the leading New York papers at the time.

The Premier of Queensland is the head of the Government of Queensland, Australia. The Premier does the same job at a state level as the Prime Minister of Australia does at a national level. Formal power is held by the Queen who is represented in Queensland by the Governor of Queensland. The Governor acts on the advice given to him by the Premier. The current Premier of Queensland is Anna Bligh.

Queensland is governed under the Westminster system of parliamentary government. Unlike other Australian states, it is not a bicameral system, having only one elected house. This house is called the Legislative Assembly. After an election, the State Governor appoints as Premier, the leader of the party who can control a majority of the elected members in the lower house. The Premier must resign if they no longer have a majority in the Legislative Assembly. This can happen if they lose seats at an election, or if their own political party does not support them.

Queensland was a British colony, and power was held by the Governor. In 1859 Britain allowed Queensland to have its own parliament, and the power was passed to the Premier.

Lightning Bar

Lightning Bar was an American Quarter Horse racehorse and breeding stallion. He was owned by Art Pollard. Lightning Bar's father was a Thoroughbred, and his mother was originally from Louisiana. Louisiana was known for breeding racehorses that ran short distances. Although he only raced for one year, he still managed to achieve an AAA speed index. His racing career was cut short by illnesses. After racing, he became a show horse and a roping horse. As a breeding stallion, he only fathered eight crops of foals, but fathered a number of important horses. His most famous son was Doc Bar. Lightning Bar died in 1960 from disease, at the age of 9. Lightning Bar was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Association's (AQHA's) American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 2008.

Born in 1951, Lightning Bar was bred to be a racehorse. Injuries and illnesses kept him from racing past the age of two. He was bred by Art Pollard, who owned him his entire life. He was fathered by Three Bars, a Thoroughbred stallion later inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame. Lightning Bar's mother was Della P, a daughter of the Thoroughbred stallion Doc Horn. His maternal grandmother, was a mare who was never given a name and was sired by Old D. J. Art Pollard bought Della P from "Dink" Parker for $1,750 ($ as of 2017) in the late 1940s. Della P was bred in Louisiana, which was a leading state breeding short distance racehorses during the years 1900–1940. Della P was brought to Arizona by Parker. 

When Lightning Bar was about 5 days old, Pollard was afraid that he had leg problems and was buck-kneed. Pollard thought about putting the young horse to sleep. First, though, he asked the advice of Parker. Pollard later said about the story, "Dink just looked at me and shook his head. 'Ain't you ever gonna learn nothing? That colt's just what you're looking for.' " When mature, Lightning Bar stood 15.2 hands (or ) tall and weighed about . He was a sorrel-colored horse.

Lightning Bar started ten times on the racetrack. He won four times, came in second three times, and came in third once. Among those finishes, he ran second and third in two stakes races. His total earnings on the track were $1,491 ($ as of 2017). His highest speed index, or comparative rating of his speed, was AAA. He only raced for one year, as he suffered from pneumonia, distemper, and injured legs. He did equal one track record for two-year-olds at Pomona Racetrack, running in 17.2 seconds. 

After Lightning Bar's racing career, he went on to be a show horse. He earned 18 open halter points with the AQHA. He earned an AQHA Champion award in 1955. He won one grand championship and one reserve championship in halter classes at recognized AQHA shows.

The first year Lightning Bar stood as a breeding stallion, his stud fee, or the fee charged to breed a mare to him, was $250 ($ as of 2017). Only nine mares were bred to him. The next year, he only bred 11 mares. In 1956, he bred 102 mares at $500 ($ as of 2017) each. One of Pollard's attempts to advertise his stallion involved letting one of his ranch hands take the stallion to a local jackpot roping. Pollard assumed that the employee would just ride Lightning Bar around and show him off. Pollard later discovered that more was involved. Pollard said later that "I should have been suspicious when he (the ranch hand) returned with Lightning Bar that afternoon, with a sheepish grin on his face. I asked him how the horse was received and he said 'The stud did good and I won the jackpot!' After congratulating him, I asked which rope horse he had used. He replied, 'The stud.' "

Pollard said of Lightning Bar that "I always had to be careful about the kind of latch I used on a gate with that horse. He could figure them out faster than I could. He would open a gate, and go for a stroll." Lightning Bar sired 148 foals in his eight breeding seasons. 118 of those foals went on to either race or show careers. 108 of his foals started races, and 77 of them won races, with a total of $476,949 total earnings. Lightning Belle was the foal who earned the most on the racetrack, earning $60,134 ($ as of 2017).

Five of Lightning Bar's foals earned AQHA Championships: Cactus Comet, Crash Bang, Lightning Rey, Pana Bar and Relampago Bar. One earned a Supreme Championship, Lightning Rey. His offspring earned $1,163.32 in National Cutting Horse Association competition. Another four earned a Superior Halter Horse title.

Lightning Bar died in June 1960 from Colitis-X, a virus of unknown origin that can kill quickly without warning. The virus infected a large number of Pollard's horses. Only three horses that caught the disease survived. Pollard was so heart-broken, he sold off his remaining stock and did not return to the Quarter Horse business for 15 years. Pollard later said about the loss of his horses that "it was a nightmare when they were wiped out. Even now, we can still feel the sadness of losing those horses." Another time, Pollard said that "Someone once said that a man deserves one good woman and one good dog in his lifetime. To that quip I would add one good horse. I certainly had one in Lightning Bar."

Lightning Bar was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Association's American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 2008. Lightning Bar's most famous son was Doc Bar, who also was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Two stakes races were run in his memory, the first one at Los Alamitos Racetrack for one year in 1961. The second ran from 1962 to 1966 and was at Ruidoso Downs in New Mexico.

Shonisaurus

Shonisaurus is the largest ichthyosaur, and the largest extinct marine animal that has yet been found. It was first discovered in rocks of the Upper Triassic in Nevada, and later in British Columbia.

Fossils of "Shonisaurus" were first found in a large deposit in Nevada in 1920. Thirty years later, they were excavated, uncovering the remains of 37 very large ichthyosaurs. These were named "Shonisaurus", ("Lizard from the Shoshone Mountains").

"Shonisaurus" lived 216–203 million years ago. The better known "S. popularis" species was about 15 metres (50ft) long, but a more recently discovered species, "S. sikkanniensis", was longer still, at about 21m (70ft).

"Shonisaurus" had a long pointed mouth that contained teeth only at the front end. It had a large whale-like body, a long dolphin-like snout, and its flippers were much longer, and narrower than in other ichthyosaurs. All of these features suggest that "Shonisaurus" may be a relatively specialised offshoot of the main ichthyosaur evolutionary line.
The first species discovered, "S. popularis", was adopted as the state fossil of Nevada in 1984. Excavations, begun in 1954 under the direction of Charles Camp and Samuel Welles of the University of California, Berkeley, were continued by Camp throughout the 60s.

The Nevada fossil sites can currently be viewed at the Berlin-Ichthyosaur State Park. The discovery of "S. sikkanniensis" in British Columbia in the 1990s made "S. popularis" the smaller of the "Shonisaurus" species. An ichthyosaur found in the Himalayan mountains called "Himalayasaurus", may be the same animal as "Shonisaurus".

The British Columbia specimen was described as follows:

Twenty20

Twenty20 or T20 cricket is a short version of the game of cricket. It started in England for inter-county competitions in 2003. A Twenty20 game has two teams, each has a single innings at batting for a maximum of 20 overs. 

A Twenty20 game is usually takes about three and half hours, with each innings lasting around 75 minutes. This means that it is similar to other team sports. It was hoped that the games would have more action and that people would enjoy the games, both at the ground and on television. It has been very successful. The England Cricket Board did not want Twenty20 to take over from other forms of cricket and these are still played.

The game has now spread around the cricket world. On most international tours there is at least one Twenty20 match and all Test-playing nations have their own competitions. The first ICC World Twenty20 was played in South Africa in 2007 with India winning by five runs against Pakistan in the final. Pakistan won the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, defeating Sri Lanka by eight wickets. England won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 defeating Australia in the final by seven wickets.

Fiorello Henry La Guardia (sometimes LaGuardia) (pronounced //; born Fiorello Enrico La Guardia) was Mayor of New York City for three terms from 1934 to 1945 as a liberal Republican. He was elected to Congress in 1916 and 1918, and again from 1922 through 1930. La Guardia and is often touted as one of the three or four greatest mayors in American history. Since he was only five feet tall and his first name was Italian for "Little Flower", he was called "the Little Flower" throughout his life.

La Guardia, a Republican who was liked across party lines, was very popular in New York during the Great Depression. As a New Dealer, he supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, and in turn Roosevelt heavily funded the city and cut off patronage from many politicians and establishments who did not support La Guardia. Many people felt that La Guardia improved New York City economically and socially and restored public faith in City Hall. During his terms, he unified the transit system, directed the building of low-cost public housing, public playgrounds, and parks, constructed airports, reorganized the police force, defeated the powerful political machine Tammany Hall and improved employment rates in New York City, even during the depression.
In the mid-1940's There was a newspaper strike in New York City. La Guardia responded to the public clamor by sitting at a radio microphone and describing and reading the Sunday comics to the children of the city. He described the cartoons and portrayed the dialects and accents of the characters.

Chinchilla, Queensland

Chinchilla is a small town of 3100 people in Queensland, Australia. It is 294 kms west of the state capital Brisbane. The Chinchilla area was first explored by Europeans when Alan Cunningham made his journey from Sydney to explore the Darling Downs in 1827. Farmers arrived to settle the area in 1848 and set up Chinchilla Station. This was part of the Wongongera Station which had been set up in 1846. It was probably named after the local Aboriginal word "jinchilla" meaning cypress pine.

The railway from Brisbane reached Chinchilla in 1878. The area became well known for its' dairy farming which became the main industry. In the 1920's, the Chinchilla area, and more than 24 million hectares of Australia had become overgrown with an imported cactus, called prickly pear. In 1925 the Australian government imported a moth from Argentina, cactoblastis, which ate the prickly pear. The Chinchilla Experimental Station was set up to breed these moths and release them. At one time the station was sending out 14 million moth eggs a day.
Built on the banks of Charley's Creek, Chinchilla has been flooded several times. During the 2010-2011 Queensland floods, Chinchilla was flooded twice in two weeks.

The story is very old; it was current in the time of Homer in the eighth century BC. There are many different versions of the story. In later versions the ram is said to have been the child of the sea god Poseidon and Themisto (less often, Nephele or Theophane). The famous telling is the "Argonautica" of Apollonius of Rhodes, written in mid-third century BC Alexandria. It reused early sources that have not survived.

Deinosuchus

Deinosuchus is an extinct relative of the alligator which lived 80 to 73 million years ago, in the Upper Cretaceous period. 

The first remains were discovered in North Carolina in the 1850s, but it was not until 1909 that the genus was named and described. 

Additional fragments were discovered in the 1940s and were later made into an influential, but inaccurate, skull reconstruction at the American Museum of Natural History. Knowledge of "Deinosuchus" is still incomplete, but better skull material has been found in recent years.

Although "Deinosuchus" was far larger than any modern crocodile or alligator—measuring up to and weighing up to —its overall appearance was fairly similar to its modern relatives. 

It had large, robust teeth that were built for crushing, and its back was covered with thick round bony plates. One study indicates that "Deinosuchus" may have lived for up to 50 years, growing at a similar rate to that of modern crocodilians, but maintaining this growth over a much longer period of time.

"Deinosuchus" fossils have been found in ten U.S. states, as well as northern Mexico. It lived on both sides of the Western Interior Seaway, and was an ambush apex predator in the coastal regions of eastern North America. 

"Deinosuchus" reached its largest size in its western habitat, but the eastern populations were far more abundant. Opinion remains divided as to whether these two populations represent separate species. "Deinosuchus" was probably capable of killing and eating large dinosaurs. It may have also fed upon sea turtles, fish, and other aquatic and terrestrial prey.

<doc id="279868" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=279868" title="Sarcosuchus">
Sarcosuchus

Sarcosuchus is an extinct genus of giant crocodile. It lived in the Lower Cretaceous of what is now Africa 135 to 112 million years ago. 

Strictly speaking,it was not a modern type of crocodile but a kind of pre-crocodile. These earlier types are called Crocodylomorphs. True crocodiles arrived in the Upper Cretaceous. 

"Sarcosuchus" was one of the largest giant crocodile-like reptiles that ever lived. It was almost twice as long as the modern saltwater crocodile and weighed approximately 8 to 10 tonnes. 

Until recently, all that was known of it was a few fossilised teeth and armour scutes, which were discovered in the Sahara Desert in the 1940s or 1950s. 

In 1997 and 2000, Paul Sereno discovered half a dozen new specimens, including one with about half the skeleton intact and most of the spine. All of the other giant crocodiles are known only from a few partial skulls, so which is actually the biggest is an open question.

Unlike other giant crododiles, "Sarcosuchus" was a river predator. As the overhanging jaw and stout teeth are designed for grabbing and crushing, its primary prey may have been large animals and smaller dinosaurs, which it ambushed, dragged into the water, crushed, drowned and then tore apart.

However, the long, thin snout of "Sarcosuchus" was very similar to the thin snouts of the modern gharial, the false gharial and the slender-snouted crocodile, all of which are nearly exclusive fish-eaters and incapable of tackling large prey. This can be contrasted to both the modern Nile crocodile and the extinct "Deinosuchus", both of which have very broad, heavy skulls, suitable for dealing with large prey. This, coupled with the abundance of large, lobe-finned fish in its environment, leads many to suggest that, far from being a dinosaur killer, Sarcosuchus was simply a large piscivore, a scaled-up version of the modern gharial.

110 million years ago, in the early Cretaceous, the Sahara was still a great tropical plain, dotted with lakes and crossed by rivers and streams that were lined with vegetation. Based on the number of fossils discovered, the aquatic "Sarcosuchus" was probably plentiful in these warm, shallow, freshwater habitats.

Unlike modern true crocodiles, which are very similar in size and shape to one another and tend to live in different areas; "Sarcosuchus" was just one of many Crocodyliformes, of different sizes and shapes, all living in the same area. Four other species of extinct Crocodyliformes were also discovered in the same rock formation along with the "Sarcosuchus", including a dwarf crocodile with a tiny, 8 cm (3 in) long skull. They filled a diverse variety of ecological niches, instead of competing with each other for resources.

HMS Endeavour

HMS "Endeavour, also known as HM Bark "Endeavour, was a British Royal Navy ship commanded by Lieutenant James Cook on his first voyage of discovery to Australia and New Zealand from 1769 to 1771.

Launched in 1764 as a coal carrying ship "Earl of Pembroke", she was bought by the Navy in 1768 for a scientific mission to the Pacific Ocean. She was also to search for the unknown southern land, "Terra Australis Incognita". Renamed as "His Majesty's Bark the Endeavour", she left Plymouth in August 1768. After sailing around Cape Horn she reached Tahiti to see the 1769 transit of Venus across the Sun. She then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south, stopping at the Pacific islands of Huahine, Borabora, and Raiatea which Cook claimed for Great Britain. In September 1769, she anchored off New Zealand, the first European vessel to reach the islands since Abel Tasman's "Heemskerck" 127 years earlier. In April 1770, "Endeavour" became the first ship to reach the east coast of Australia, when Cook went ashore at what is now known as Botany Bay.

"Endeavour" then sailed north along the Australian coast. She ran into the Great Barrier Reef near Cape Tribulation. The crew were able to get the ship onto a beach on the mainland. This is now the site of the town of Cooktown. They stayed for seven weeks so that basic repairs could be made to her hull. On 10 October 1770, she limped into port in Batavia in the Dutch East Indies for more substantial repairs. She left on 26 December, rounded the Cape of Good Hope on 13 March 1771, and reached the English port of Dover on 12 July, having been at sea for nearly three years.

The "Endeavour" spent the next three years shipping Navy stores to the Falkland Islands. She was renamed and sold in 1775, but was used as a troop transport during the American Revolutionary War. She sunk in a blockade of Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island in 1778. Her wreck has not been found, but relics, including six of her cannons and an anchor, are displayed at maritime museums worldwide. A full size working copy of "Endeavour" was launched in 1994 and is berthed alongside the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney Harbour.

Largest extinct animals

The largest extinct animals known to date are listed here. They are arranged by their taxonomy (classification). The list only deals with individual animals; size of colonies (such as coral reefs) is not dealt with here.

The largest bony fish of all time was "Leedsichthys problematicus" from the Middle Jurassic, at around long. Earlier claims have been scaled down.

The extinct megatoothed shark, "C. megalodon" is by far the biggest and most powerful shark that ever lived. This giant shark reached a length of more than . Larger individuals are possible.

The largest known crocodilian is likely "Sarcosuchus imperator" at long and weighing 8 tonnes. A close contender in size is "Deinosuchus", also estimated at around ,

The largest pterosaur was "Quetzalcoatlus northropi", at 127 kg (280 lbs) and with a wingspan of 11 m (36 ft). Another close contender is "Hatzegopteryx", also with a wingspan of 11 m (this estimate is based on a skull 3 m long (10 ft).

A mega-sauropod, "Amphicoelias fragillimus", is a contender for the largest dinosaur in history. It has been estimated at in length and in weight. Unfortunately, the fossil remains of this dinosaur have been lost. 

However, a titanosaurid, "Bruhathkayosaurus" has been estimated at in length, and 159–200 metric tons in weight, making it possibly larger than "A. fragillimus" and potentially rival the modern blue whale in size. However, this animal is known from scanty evidence. Another notably large titanosaurid is "Argentinosaurus", which is known from partially preserved remains. This sauropod has been estimated to be long and around 73–99 metric tons in weight. Some other sauropods, "Supersaurus", "Sauroposeidon", and "Seismosaurus" (also known as "Diplodocus hallorum") probably rival "Argentinosaurus" in size.
The very largest ornithopods, like "Zhuchengosaurus" and "Shantungosaurus" were as heavy as medium sized sauropods at up to 23 metric tons, but never grew far beyond 15 meters (50 feet). The largest is probably "Zhuchengosaurus" at in length. However, "Lambeosaurus laticaudus" appears to be close contender at around in length. 
The largest known theropod is "Spinosaurus aegyptiacus", estimated at in length and around 7–9 metric tons in weight. "Spinosaurus aegyptiacus" is also recognized as the largest terrestrial predator yet known. 

A close contender in size is a giant theropod from South America, "Giganotosaurus carolinii", whose holotype specimen is estimated at in length, and another specimen is estimated at in length. A study however presents "Carcharodontosaurus" as a close contender in size to "Spinosaurus aegyptiacus". Some other notable giant theropods (e.g. "Tyrannosaurus rex", "Acrocanthosaurus", and "Mapusaurus") may also have rivaled these giant theropods in size. Another very large theropod was "Deinocheirus", being tall at hips,
and weighing up to 16,000 pounds. The largest dromaeosaurid is "Utahraptor". In addition to being the largest known dromaeosaurid, it was also the largest known deinonychosaur and the largest known paravian.

The largest thyreophoran was "Ankylosaurus" at in length and 6.5 tons in weight. "Stegosaurus" was also 9 meters (30 ft) long but around 5 tons in weight.

The largest ceratopsian known is probably the newly discovered "Eotriceratops" with a skull alone being in length. Maximum size of this ceratopsian is suggested to be around in length and 13 tonnes in weight.

The largest ichthyosaur was "Shonisaurus sikanniensis" at ~21 metres (70 ft) in length. This would make it the largest extinct marine animal.

The largest plesiosaur was "Mauisaurus haasti", growing to about 20 metres (66 ft) in length. Next behind was "Elasmosaurus" at 14 metres (46 ft) long.

There is much controversy over the largest of these reptiles. Fossil remains of a pliosaur nicknamed as "Predator X" have been discovered and excavated from Norway in 2008. This pliosaur has been estimated at in length and 41 metric tons in weight. However, in 2002, a team of paleontologists in Mexico discovered the remains of a pliosaur nicknamed as "Monster of Aramberri", which is also estimated at in length. This specimen is however claimed to be a juvenile and has been attacked by a larger pliosaur. Some media sources claimed that "Monster of Aramberri" was a "Liopleurodon" but its species is unconfirmed thus far. 

The largest known prehistoric snake is "Titanoboa cerrejonensis", estimated at in length and 1135 kg–1819 kg in weight. Another large fossil snake is "Gigantophis garstini", estimated at around in length. However, a close rival in size to "Gigantophis" is a fossil snake, "Palaeophis colossaeus", which may have been around in length.

Giant mosasaurs are the largest animals within this group. The largest known mosasaur is likely "Mosasaurus hoffmanni", estimated at in length. A close contender in size is "Hainosaurus bernardi", estimated at in length. Another giant mosasaur is "Tylosaurus", estimated at in length. 

The largest birds of all time might have been the elephant birds of Madagascar. Of almost the same size was the Australian "Dromornis stirtoni". Both were about 3 m tall (10 ft). The elephant birds were up to 400 kg and "Dromornis stirtoni" was up to 500 kg in weight. The tallest bird ever was the Giant Moa ("Dinornis maximus") at 12 ft tall. 

The largest flight-capable bird was "Argentavis magnificens" which a wingspan of 8.3 m (28 ft), and a body weight of 110 kg (244 lb).

"Basilosaurus" was once recognized as one of the largest known extinct cetaceans at in length.

The largest fossil toothed whale was the Miocene whale "Livyatan melvillei" which was estimated to be 13.5-17.5 meter in length. One notable feature of "L. melvillei" was its teeth which were 36 cm long and is unmatched by any other animal, extinct or alive.

However, the largest fossil whales were baleen whales (plankton feeders) from the Pliocene and Pleistocene Epochs. A notable example is the bones of a Pliocene age baleen whale, assigned the questionable name ""Balaenoptera sibbaldina"", which likely rivaled the modern blue whale in size. 

The largest perissodactyl, and land mammal, of all time was "Indricotherium". It stood 5.5 m (18 ft) tall at the shoulder, a total height of 8 m (27 ft), totally 12 m (40 ft) long and may have weighed 20 tonnes (22 tons), though mass estimates vary. Some prehistoric horned rhinos also grew to large sizes. The giant woolly rhino "Elasmotherium" reached 20 ft long and 6.6 ft high.

The largest by far was the giant "Arthropleura". Measuring 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) and 45 centimetres (18 in) wide, it was the largest terrestrial arthropod of all time.

Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry

Lee "Scratch" Perry (born Rainford Hugh Perry, 20 March 1936, Kendal, Jamaica) is a musician, who has been influential in the movement and acceptance of reggae and dub music in Jamaica and overseas. He has lots of pseudonyms, such as Pipecock Jackxon and The Upsetter.

Perry's musical life began in the late 1950s as a record seller for Clement Coxsone Dodd's sound system. As his sometimes bad relationship with Dodd developed, he found himself doing a variety of important tasks at Dodd's Studio One hit factory, going on to record nearly thirty songs for the label. Disagreements between the pair due to personality and financial problems, a now normal theme throughout Perry's career, led him to leave the studio and seek new musical outlets. He soon found a new home at Joe Gibbs's Amalgamated Records.

Working with Gibbs, Perry carried on his recording career but, once again, financial problems caused problems. Perry broke ranks with Gibbs and formed his own label, Upsetter, in 1968. His first single "People Funny Boy", which was an insult directed at Gibbs, sold well with 60,000 copies sold in Jamaica alone. It is notable for its innovative use of a sample (a crying baby) as well as a fast, chugging beat that would soon become identifiable as "reggae" (the new kind of sound which was given the name "Steppers"). From 1968 until 1972 he worked with his studio band The Upsetters. During the 1970s, Perry released many recordings on a variety of record labels that he founded, and many of his songs were popular in both Jamaica and the UK. He soon became known for his unique production types as well as his mad character.

Iran Air Flight 227

Iran Air Flight 277 was a passenger plane which, on , 2011, crashed while trying to land in bad weather at Urmia Airport, West Azarbaijan province, Iran. The aircraft that crashed was going between Mehrabad International Airport, Tehran, Iran, and Urmia. It was an Iran Air Boeing 727-286Adv, registration EP-IRP.

The aircraft that crashed was a Boeing 727-286Adv. It was registered EP-IRP and was built in 1974. The aircraft spent a long time out of service, and was in Baghdad, Iraq from 1984-90, and then stored from 1991-2002. After that, it was fixed and went back to flying.

The flight was going between Tehran and Urmia. The plane crashed when it was about to land. It crashed near a lake. The crash happened at around 19:45 (16:15 UTC), and was thought to be caused by bad weather. The aircraft had missed its first try at landing, and it either crashed during a go-around, or while trying to return to Tehran. The weather at the time of the accident included snow and it was hard to see. When it crashed, the plane broke into more than one piece, but there was no fire or explosion. There were different reports right after the crash as to the type of aircraft that it happened to. Either a Fokker 100 or a Boeing 727 was thought to have crashed, but it was later made clear that the plane was a 727. 

The number of people on board was not known; RIA Novosti said that 95 passengers were on the plane, but Reuters said there were 156 passengers and the Associated Press said there were 105 passengers. Later reports said there were either 105 or 106 people on board. Between 10 and 12 were crew and either 95 or 94 were passengers. The Iran Civil Aviation Organization said the day after the crash that a total of 93 passengers and 12 crew were on board.

At least 77 people were killed and 26 were hurt. It was hard to rescue people because there was a lot of snow at the time. A local official said that "[the] problem at the moment for rescue work is the heavy snow," which he said was around deep at the site of the crash. After the crash, 36 ambulances and 11 hospitals were used in the rescue.

Iran ordered that the reason the plane crashed be found out. A day after the crash, people at the location had found both the flight's cockpit voice recorder, which records sounds in the cockpit, and the flight data recorder, which records what the plane does. Iran's Transport Ministry said that the investigation will be made up of several groups of people that study different parts of. The Iran Civil Aviation Organization will be in charge. The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were both taken to Tehran as part of the investigation.

Clinical psychology

Clinical psychology is the study of mental disorders. It is about learning, understanding, diagnosing, treating or preventing these types of illnesses. Clinical psychologists examinine the mental functioning of a person and use psychotherapy to treat the disorder. Psychotherapy uses talking instead of medical or physical treatments. 

The first psychological clinic opened in 1896 at the University of Pennsylvania by Lightner Witmer. In the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology mainly about psychological assessment, not treatment. After World War II, there was a big increase in the numbers of trained clinical psychologists. There are two main educational models - the Ph.D. scientist-practitioner model which looks at research, and the Psy.D. practitioner-scholar model which looks at treatment. Clinical psychologists are now regarded as experts in psychotherapy.
Clinical psychologists generally train in one of four primary academic areas– psychodynamic, humanistic, behavior therapy/cognitive behavioral, and systems or family therapy.
Sigmund Freud’s ideas led to the development of psychodynamic psychotherapy. Its goal is to help the patient, or client, to understand the meaning of the unconscious desires and conflicts that have caused their problems.

Humanistic psychology was developed in the 1950s in reaction to both behaviorism (the belief that conditioning is the main cause of human behavior) and psychoanalysis (the belief that the unconscious is the main cause of human behavior). 
The major principles of humanistic psychology are:

This approach includes behavior therapy, a form of psychotherapy that aims to strengthen desired behaviors and remove undesired behaviors. Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) was formed by combining behavior therapy with cognitive therapy (which helps a person identify and change thinking or behavior that does not function normally) in the second half of the 20th century.
Family therapy focuses on the relationships between the members of a family. Goals may include helping a family deal with the problems of one member or improving communication.

It is part of the Cebu Metropolitan Area which is in Cebu City. According to the 2007 census, it has a population of about 292,530 people.

The city is linked to Mandaue City on mainland Cebu by the Mactan-Mandaue Bridge and Marcelo Fernan Bridge. Mactan-Cebu International Airport, the second busiest airport in the Philippines, is in Lapu-Lapu City. The only aquarium attraction in the Visayas is also in Lapu-lapu City. It is known us "Opon'.

Lapu-Lapu City belongs to the island of Cebu. It is surrounded by a big ocean like Mactan Channel and Cebu Sea as well as known us Cebu Strait. It is in the center of Cebu.

In the 16th century, Mactan Island was colonized by Spain. Augustinian friars founded the town of Opon in 1730. It became a city in 1961 and was renamed after Datu Lapu-Lapu, the Island's chieftain who defeated Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. This battle is commemorated at the Lapu-Lapu shrine in Punta Engaño.

Politician Manuel A. Zosa, the representative of the Sixth District of Cebu, sponsored the Bill converting the former municipality of Opon into the present day City of Lapu-Lapu. This was the Republic Act 3134, known as the City Charter of Lapu-Lapu which was signed on June 17, 1961 by former Philippine President Carlos P. Garcia.

Lapu-Lapu City is politically subdivided into 30 barangays.

Typhoon Xangsane

Typhoon Xangsane (international designation: 0615, JTWC designation: 18W, PAGASA name: Typhoon Milenyo) was a deadly typhoon that affected the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand during the 2006 Pacific typhoon season. It was the fifteenth tropical storm and ninth typhoon recognized by the Japan Meteorological Agency operationally during the season, although in post-operational analysis it became the tenth typhoon of the season with the addition of Typhoon Maria. According to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, Xangsane was the sixteenth tropical storm and tenth typhoon of the season, and was a Category 4-equivalent typhoon in terms of 1-minute average wind speeds. The name Xangsane was submitted by Laos and means elephant.

Xangsane made landfall in the Philippines, battering the northern islands with torrential rains and strong winds, and causing widespread flooding and landslides. After passing over Manila and emerging over the South China Sea, the typhoon made a second landfall in central Vietnam, also causing flooding and landslides there and in Thailand. The storm was responsible for at least 279 deaths, mostly in the Philippines and Vietnam, and at least $747 million (2006 USD) in damage.

Late on September 24, 2006, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, noted that an area of convection, had persisted about 460 NM to the southeast of Manila, in the Philippines. The JTWC assessed the development of a significant Tropical cyclone, as fair. This was because convection was beginning to flare up near a developing Low Level Circulation Center, the JTWC also noted that the disturbance had a broad circulation. Early the next day both the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) designated the Tropical disturbance as a Tropical Depression with PAGASA assigning the local name of Tropical Depression Milenyo, to the depression. Later that morning the JTWC reassessed the potential of the disturbance forming into a significant tropical Cyclone within 24 hours as good, and issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the developing disturbance. Early that afternoon the JTWC started to issue advisories on the disturbance and designated it as Tropical Depression 18W. Later that day the JTWC upgraded as the depression moved towards the west it was upgraded to a Tropical Storm by the JTWC. Early on September 26 the JMA also upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, and assigned the international name of Xangsane.

Later on September 26, the JMA upgraded Xangsane to a severe tropical storm, whilst six hours later both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded Xangsane to typhoon with the JTWC reporting wind speeds equivalent to a category one typhoon. Early the next day Xangsane was upgraded to a category 2 typhoon and then over the next six hours Xangsane rapidly intensified into a category 4 typhoon with wind speeds of 115 kts (130 mph, 215 km/h). Meanwhile the JMA reported that Xangsane had reached its peak wind speeds of 85 kts (100 mph, 155 km/h). Early that afternoon the JTWC reported that Xangsane, had reached its peak wind speeds of 125 kts (145 mph, 230 km/h).

Xangsane then passed through the Philippine islands, wreaking havoc and becoming the strongest typhoon to directly impact Metro Manila in eleven years. As it entered the South China Sea as a weak typhoon, it began to re-intensify, reaching its secondary peak strength shortly before landfall at Danang, Vietnam on October 1. The JTWC ceased advisories after landfall, while the JMA carried the storm inland until it was over Thailand as a tropical depression. It remained as a low pressure area over central Indochina on the JMA's weather charts for several days, while the U.S. Navy's Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting system carried the remnants of Xangsane into the Bay of Bengal.

On September 27, PAGASA issued Storm Signal Number 3, a warning for winds of 100 185 km/h (62 115 mph), for areas of southern Luzon. Storm Signal Number 2, for winds of 60 100 km/h (37 62 mph), was raised for northern Samar Island and central Luzon. Storm Signal Number 1 (30 60 km/h, 20 37 mph) was issued for northwestern Luzon, including Metro Manila, and northern Visayas, including the rest of Samar Island. Schools in the warned area were suspended, and airports and seaports were closed. Philippine Airlines cancelled over half of its flights to and from Ninoy Aquino International Airport for September 28, and various transit services also suspended service. Metro Manila and the Tagalog provinces were warned of possible flooding and strong winds.

When it became clear that Xangsane would approach the Capital, PAGASA upgraded the warning for Manila and central Luzon to Storm Signal Number 3 on September 28. All the storm signals were discontinued later that day.

Stamen

The stamen is the male reproductive organ of a flower. It produces the pollen. The stamen has two parts: the anther, and the stalk.

The anther contains microsporangia. Each microsporangium contains pollen mother cells. These undergo meiosis, and produce pollen grains, which contain the male gametes (sperm).

The pollen grains are actually haploid male gametophytes.

The pollen is released by the opening of the anther. The pollen is carried by some agent (wind, or some animal) to the receptive surface of the carpel of the same or another flower. This process is known as pollination. After successful pollination, the pollen grain (immature microgametophyte) completes its development by growing a "pollen tube" and undergoing mitosis to produce two male gametes.

2011 Pacific typhoon season

The 2011 Pacific typhoon season is a current event in which tropical cyclones form in the Western Pacific Ocean. The season will run throughout 2011 with most tropical cyclones forming between May and November. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100th meridian east and the 180th meridian. Within the Northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies who assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km/h, (40 mph) anywhere in the basin. Whilst the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N-25°N even if the cyclone has had a name assigned to it by the Japan Meteorological Agency. Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center are given a number with a "W" suffix. On average, 27 storms form in this basin every year.

During each season several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones, tropical storms, and typhoons will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country.

Since the 2000 Pacific typhoon season, the Guy Carpenter Asia-Pacific Climate Impact Centre (GCACIC), of the City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK), have issued forecasts of activity for each upcoming typhoon season. On May 4 and July 5, 2011, the GCACIC issued forecasts which predicted the amount of tropical cyclones, tropical storms and typhoons there would be during 2011 as well as for how many tropical cyclones will make landfall on China or pass within 100 km (60 mi) of the Korean Peninsula or Japan.

This season the GCACIC predicted in May that 31 tropical cyclones, 27 tropical storms, and 17 typhoons would either form or move into the North Western Pacific this year. In their July forecast, the GCACIC lowered their prediction for the number of tropical storms developing into a typhoon by one which they blamed on the strength of the India-Burma trough. For Southern China the GCACIC predicted in May that seven tropical cyclones would make landfall, during the year compared to an average of five. They further predicted that five of the cyclones would make landfall on Southern China between May and August, while the other two would landfall between September and December. After two tropical cyclones had made landfall on Southern China during June, the July GCACIC forecast predicted that seven tropical cyclones would make landfall, during the main season between July and December. For the Korean Peninsular and Japan, the GCACIC predicted in May that six tropical cyclones would affect either Japan or the peninsular during the year compared to an average of four, and predicted that there would be an above average amount of landfalls on Japan. After three tropical cyclones affected the region in May and June, the GCACIC predicted that seven tropical cyclones would affect either the Korean Peninsular or Japan during the main part of the season.

Since the 2000 Pacific typhoon season, the Tropical Storm Risk Consortium (TSR) of University College London have issued forecasts of activity for each upcoming typhoon season. Forecasts on the number of tropical storms, typhoons and intense typhoons there would be during 2011 in the Western Pacific were released in March, May, July and August. In all off their forecasts this year, TSR predicted that the season would see activity close to the average with 28 tropical storms, 18 typhoons and 8 intense typhoons developing during the season.

On January 17, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) reported that they were expecting between 20 and 22 tropical cyclones to pass through the Philippine area of responsibility during 2011. On March 23 the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO), reported that they had predicted that 6-9 tropical cyclones would affect Hong Kong during the season. On April 26, the Thai Meteorological Department predicted that 2 tropical storms would affect Thailand during 2011. They predicted that 1 would move through Vietnam and affect Upper Thailand, during August or September. While the second tropical storm was expected to move through Southern Thailand during October or November. On June 30, Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau predicted that the 2011 season would be near its normal climatic average of 25.7, and predicted that 22-26 tropical storms, would occur over the Western Pacific during 2011, with 3 to 5 of them affecting Taiwan.

On April 1, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring an area of low pressure associated with intermittent convection over the South China Sea, roughly 535 km (335 mi) east-southeast of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The former of these two agencies immediately declared the system a tropical depression, the first of the 2011 season. Following further development of the system, most notably convective banding around the low-level circulation center, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the storm. Early on April 2, the agency followed through with this alert and designated the low as Tropical Depression 01W. However, within hours of this, the depression became devoid of convection as wind shear buffeted the system. This prevented the cyclone from intensifying beyond depression status as it remained nearly stationary. Failing to regain convection by April 3, the depression degenerated into a remnant low and the final advisory from the JTWC was issued. The JMA continued to monitor the system as a tropical depression for another day before issuing their last warning on the system.

On March 30, the JMA began monitoring an area of low pressure located southwest of Yap. By April 2, the system developed a low-level circulation, though convection appeared disorganized. Exhibiting good outflow within a region of weak wind shear, the low was anticipated to develop further over the following several days as it drifted west-northwestward. After briefly stalling early on April 3, the storm turned towards the east. Additionally, the JMA considered the system sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression. As the system was located to the west of 135°E, PAGASA began issuing advisories on the depression as well, assigning it the name "Amang". Tracking northeastward, the depression eventually developed enough convection to be declared Tropical Depression 02W by the JTWC on April 4. However, this was expected to be brief as a decaying frontal boundary approached from the west and prompted the system to undergo an extratropical transition. This intensification prompted the National Weather Service (NWS) in Tiyan, Guam to issue a tropical storm warning for the islands of Agrihan, Pagan and Alamagan. Interacting with the front and high wind shear, the system became partially exposed and elongated as it moved over cooler waters. Early on April 6, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the depression as it began to dissipate over open waters. Following degradation of the storm's structure, the NWS discontinued warnings for the Mariana Islands on April 6. The JMA continued to monitor the system for several more hours before ceasing advisories on it as well.
Early of May 4, an area of low pressure formed about 140 km (85 mi) to the west of Palau Island. On that same day, the low pressure starts to strengthen rapidly with improved LLCC, tightly–wrapped shallow convective banding and a well–defined center. On the next day the low pressure starts to move northwest in general direction to the seas east of Philippine Islands. However it remained almost stationary by afternoon due to the influence of high pressure that located in the northeast of the system. By that time, its LLCC starts to become elongated and the system was also located in favorable sea surface temperatures with low vertical wind shear. Later of that day, its LLCC starts to consolidate again and the system starts to move northwest slowly, whilst the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the system into a tropical depression In the afternoon of May 6, Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the low pressure into a tropical depression. In the same evening, PAGASA upgraded the low pressure into a tropical depression and assigned its local name 'Bebeng'. In the afternoon of May 7, JMA upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm, and assigned the name 'Aere'. During the early morning of May 12, the JMA downgraded Aere to a tropical depression while south of Kyushu Island.

Throughout the Philippines, multiple agencies activated their emergency plans as the storm approached. The Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Philippine National Police, and the Philippine Coast Guard were all placed on standby to deploy to areas struck by Aere once the storm passed. Several ports were affected by the storm, stranding 1,379 passengers by the afternoon of May 7. According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, at least 35 people have been killed and two more are missing as a result of Aere. Agricultural losses are estimated at PHP1.37 billion (US$31.7 million). Widespread flooding and landslides damaged homes, blocked off roads and severed communications. In Catarman, Northern Samar, of rain fell in just 24 hours, resulted in significant flash flooding.

On May 19, the JTWC reported that an area of low pressure had persisted about 510 km (320 mi) to the southeast of Yap. As the system moved towards the northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge of high pressure, it rapidly consolidated in an area of light to moderate vertical windshear. The JMA then started to monitor the system as a tropical depression later that day, before the JTWC designated it as Tropical Depression 04W early on May 20. The JTWC then reported later that day that the depression had intensified into a tropical storm with windspeeds of 65 km/h (40 mph), however it later reported that it had overestimated the windspeeds and consequently lowered the storm's status to a tropical depression, based on observations from Yap island. Late on May 21, both the JMA and the JTWC reported that the depression had now become a tropical storm with the JMA naming it as Songda. Over the next couple of days, the system gradually intensified further while moving northwest into PAGASA's area of responsibility. PAGASA named it as Chedeng. At 1200  UTC on May 24, the JTWC reported that Songda had intensified into a typhoon. 12 hours later the JMA followed suit while the system was located about 800 km (500 mi) to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines. It rapidly intensified into a Category 5 typhoon. In the afternoon of May 29, Songda became extratropical south of Shikoku Island.

Although Songda remained offshore, heavy rains within the typhoon's outer bands impacted the Philippines, causing significant flash flooding and landslides. Four fatalities are attributed to the system there. Further north, Okinawa experience intense wind gusts, measured up to 198 km/h (123 mph), along with torrential rain. Extensive damage took place across the area with losses reaching ¥23.2 billion ($287 million); however, there were no fatalities. As it became extratropical, Songda brought heavy rains from Kyushu to eastern Honshu, causing significant flooding. At least 13 people were killed in the country and an estimated 400,000 had to be evacuated around Tokyo alone.

During the evening of May 31, the JMA upgraded an area of low pressure to a tropical depression. Initially, the tropical depression was located about 400 km (250 miles) south west of Hong Kong. The system did not develop further and was downgraded to an area of low pressure by the JMA on June 2.

On early June 8, an area of low pressure formed about 10 km west of Cebu City, Philippines. As it moved towards the Mindoro Strait the JMA and JTWC began to monitor the system. In the early morning hours of June 9, the Philippines' PAGASA upgraded the system to a tropical depression and reported the storm center to be about 450 km west of Dagupan City in the Philippines. The next day, the JMA and JTWC upgraded the tropical depression into a tropical storm, with the JMA naming it Sarika. During the morning of June 11 the JTWC downgraded Sarika to a tropical depression after making landfall in Shantou, China. The JTWC soon issued their final advisory on Sarika. Sarika made landfall on mainland China with winds of 75 km/h (45 mph). As a result of the storm, 23 people were killed in Xianning, and ten more were declared missing. Damages from Sarika are estimated at $248 million.

Early June 15 an area of low pressure area embedded along the Intertropical Convergence Zone located about 250 km west of Puerto Princesa, Palawan. As is moved towards the South China Sea, both the JMA and the JTWC started monitoring it. During the morning of June 15, the JMA upgraded it into a tropical depression. Due to an anticyclone, the system dissipated during the early morning of June 16,as it made landfall in Hong Kong.

On June 15, the JTWC started to monitor an area of disturbed weather that was located about 1350 km (835 mi), to the southeast of Manila, Philippines. Over the next couple of days the system gradually developed further, before late on June 16, the JMA, JTWC and PAGASA, all reported that the system had developed into a tropical depression, with PAGASA naming it as Egay. Egay continued to develop during June 17 as it moved towards the northeast, and on June 18 the JTWC reported that Egay had intensified into a tropical storm. Late on June 19, the JTWC downgraded Egay to a tropical depression, but they upgraded Egay again to a tropical storm on June 20. Early on June 20, the JTWC downgraded Egay to a tropical depression again. On June 21, the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical storm and named it Haima, with the JTWC following suit on June 22.

During the evening of June 23, the JTWC downgraded Haima to a tropical depression after making landfall in Zhanjiang, Guangdong, China but upgraded it to a tropical storm again on June 24. Early on June 25, Haima became a tropical depression after moving inland in Vietnam. As it made landfall over Hanoi, Vietnam, the JTWC and the Hong Kong Observatory downgraded Haima to a low pressure area.

Early on June 20, and area of low pressure about 760 km (470 miles), east of the Philippines began to be monitored by both the JTWC and JMA. That evening, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Soon afterwards, PAGASA upgraded the system into a tropical depression, naming it as "Falcon". At the time of the upgrade, Falcon was located about 1000 km (620 miles), east northeast of Cebu City. During the evening of June 21, the JTWC also reported that Falcon had strengthened into a tropical depression. On June 22, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded Falcon into a tropical storm, and the JMA named it Meari. Meari leaves Philippines with 2 deaths and 5 missing. In the afternoon on June 24, the JMA upgraded Meari to a severe tropical storm as it passed Okinawa, Japan.

On June 26, Meari rapidly moved to the Yellow Sea but slowly passed Weihai, Shandong, China, and then the JMA downgraded Meari to a tropical storm on the same day. On June 27, the JTWC downgraded Meari to a tropical depression before it made landfall in North Korea, and the JMA reported that Meari became a low pressure area later.

Heavy rains from the storm's outer bands triggered significant flooding and landslides in South Korea. At least nine people were killed and three others were reported missing across the country. In North Korea, heavy rains from the storm caused widespread flooding and damage. At least 160 homes were destroyed and 50,000 hectares of crops submerged. Several reports of confirmed fatalities arose but no details on how many were given to news agencies.

Late July 9 an area of low pressure area formed about 300 km (186 mi) east of Aurora as it moves Northwest it has been located 500 km east-southeast of Basco, Batanes. On the morning of July 9, JMA upgraded the low pressure area into a tropical depression and it was located 450 km northeast of Cagayan. In the afternoon, PAGASA upgraded the low pressure area into a tropical depression and named it Goring. After moving to Fujian, China, it dissipated on the evening on July 10.
On July 11, both the JMA and JTWC upgraded a tropical disturbance to a tropical depression which was located near Minamitorishima. On July 12, both the JMA and JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Ma-on. Early on July 13, the JMA upgraded Ma-on to a severe tropical storm. Late on July 13, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded Ma-on to a typhoon. After absorbing Tokage, Ma-on reached its peak strength on July 16. The PAGASA named it Ineng on July 17.

As Ma-on was affecting Japan, the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm in the evening on July 19. Ma-on made landfall in Tokushima later. The JMA downgraded Ma-on to a severe tropical storm after it made landfall in Wakayama early on July 20. The JTWC downgraded Ma-on to a tropical depression on July 21 and discontinued advisories the following day. The JMA downgraded Ma-on to a tropical storm early on July 23. On July 24, Ma-on weakened into an extratropical cyclone east of the Tōhoku region.

A low pressure area has formed about 740 km north-northwest of Palau. Early on July 14, the JMA upgraded it into a tropical depression, and the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. On July 15, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Tokage, and the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression later. PAGASA also upgraded it to a tropical depression and named it Hanna. Due to the Fujiwhara effect, Typhoon Ma-on, the powerful storm just northeast of Tokage, later weakened Tokage to a tropical depression and completely absorbed it early on July 16.

Originally a low pressure area, the JMA reported that a tropical depression formed from it inland in Guangdong, China on July 16. On July 17, the depression dissipated.

Originally a low pressure area, the JMA reported that a tropical depression formed from it in the Gulf of Tonkin near Guangdong, China on July 16. However, it quickly dissipated after only six hours.
Early on July 22, an area of low pressure formed to the east of Philippines. The system gradually drifted west over the next few days and late on July 24, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center Started Monitoring the system as a Tropical Depression. Early the next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the area of low pressure into a Tropical Depression. A few hours later, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) started monitoring the system as a Tropical Depression and named it 'Juaning'. The system continued to drift westwards and strengthened rapidly, that on midnight, that day, the JMA furhter upgraded the system into a Tropical Storm, naming it Nock-Ten. Early on July 27, the JMA reported that Nock-ten continued to strengthen and upgraded it into a Severe Tropical Storm. A few hours later, the JTWC reported that Nock-ten rapidly intensified to a category 1 typhoon and made its landfall over northern Aurora (province) and started weakening. Later the same day, the JMA reported that Nock-ten has exited the Luzon island at Candon maintaining severe tropical storm strength. However, overnight, the storm rapidly weakened and the JMA downgraded it into a minor tropical storm the next day. However, on July 29, the storm gradually regained strength and approached south China coast at Qionghai, China. Later that day, the storm strengthened over land and headed north towards Hainan's provincial capital region Haikou. Over the next day, the storm drifted to the west and made landfall over Northern Vietnam. The storm weakened rapidly and at midnight that day, the JMA, issuing their final warning on the system, Downgraded it into a tropical low. 

The provinces of Albay and Camarines were reported to be completely flooded by the rain. Minor damage to rice crops was reported. More heavier rains were expected throughout the day as the system has exited land into south china sea and will soon start reintensifying. The number of missing was also pushed up to 31 after 25 crewmembers of a fishing boat were reported missing when their fishing boat was caught in the storm off Masbate. Nock-ten suspended all classes in Luzon from Pre-school to college levels on July 26 and 27. In Northern Luzon, Nock-ten poured down heavy rainfall becoming widespread flooding in the area. The national roads were impassable and landslides were also reported. About 26 domestic flights were cancelled from July 26 to 27 due to heavy rains and strong winds.
Late on July 23, an area of low pressure formed to the southeast of Chuuk. the system gradually drifted to the west and on July 25, the JTWC upgraded the low pressure area to a tropical depression. At that time, it was located approximately to the west of Guam. At midnight, that day, the JMA started monitoring the system as a tropical depression. Early on July 28, the JTWC upgraded the system into a Tropical Storm. A few hours later, the JMA too upgraded the system to a tropical storm, naming it "Muifa". Soon, the storm moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) named it "Kabayan". The storm gradually drifted north over the next day maintaining strength. On the night of July 29, Muifa was upgraded into a Severe Tropical Storm. Overnight, the storm strengthened rapidly and was upgraded into a Typhoon the next morning. The storm strengthened so rapidly, and the JTWC reported that the storm's peak winds were reaching , as it strengthened into a Category 5 Typhoon. However, the typhoon couldn't maintain Category 5 strength for a long time. According to the JTWC, On July 31, the typhoon interacted with an upper level trough and weakened into a Category 4 Typhoon on the SSHS. The system gradually moved north, then turned west and drifted towards Okinawa, before turning northwest again, when it was finally downgraded into a Tropical Storm by the JTWC. Soon afterwards, the JMA too downgraded Muifa to a Severe Tropical storm. After weakening to a tropical storm, Muifa made landfall at the estuary of the Yalu River on August 8, and the JTWC issued the final warning. Early on August 9, Muifa weakened to a tropical depression in Northeast China and became a low pressure area later.

Muifa killed 2 men, as their boat was capsized in the vicinity of Hagonoy, Bulacan and Pampanga Delta. Due to the southwest monsoon enhanced by Muifa, it caused heavy rains in several parts of Luzon including Metro Manila. Early of August 2, the Malacañang Palace suspended government offices and Pre-school to college level in NCR. Nearby provinces like Calabarzon (Region IV-A) also suspended their classes. In Marikina 200 residents or 31 families living in communities along the Marikina River have sought shelter in evacuation centers.

On July 28, an area of low pressure formed approximately to the West of Guam. Over the next few days, the system gradually drifted to the northwest and on July 31, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the low into a Tropical Depression to the west of Philippines. Later that day, The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) started monitoring the system as a tropical depression and named it "Lando". The system slowly tracked northward. However, on the next day, due to Fujiwhara effect, Typhoon Muifa the much more powerful system, just to the north-east of Lando, weakened Lando. As a result, the PAGASA issued their final warning on the system, downgrading it to a tropical low. But despite this, Tropical Depression Lando regenerated soon afterwards, and the JMA reissued their advisories on Lando. Tropical Depression Lando continued to persist for another day, as it slowly tracked eastward, just off the western coast of Luzon. Then, during the late afternoon of August 2, the JMA stopped tracking Lando, as it had dissipated. Early on August 3, the remmants of Tropical Depression Lando dissipated completely, without ever reaching Luzon.

Early on August 3, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded an area of low pressure near Wake Island to a tropical depression. The system intensified rapidly and just 6 hours later, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, naming it "Merbok". Soon, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started monitoring the system as a tropical depression, and upgraded it to a tropical storm later. Merbok began to move westward slowly, but soon afterwards, it turned northwest and gradually drifted in that direction. Late on August 5, the JMA upgraded Merbok into a Severe Tropical Storm. Early on August 6, the JTWC upgraded Merbok into a Category 1 Typhoon East-southeast of Tokyo, Japan. Early the next day, the storm's winds reached a peak of on the SSHS. Later that day, the system was caught in a moderate Vertical Wind Shear and started weakening. On August 8, the system started accelerating towards north at the speed of and was gradually diminishing because of colder and colder sea surface temperatures and unfavorable conditions. As a result, the JMA reporting that the system was no longer a Severe Tropical Storm, downgraded Merbok to a Tropical Storm. Late on that day, the system started showing extratropical characteristics as the convection near the eye dissipated rapidly. Thus, the JTWC issued their final warning on the system reporting that the system was no longer tropical. Later, the JMA, issuing their final warning on the system, reported that the system was no longer tropical. 

Early on August 3, a tropical depression formed near the Bonin Islands. The system slowly began to track northwestwards, towards Japan. Late on August 4, the system dissipated near the Kii Peninsula.

Late on August 8, the JMA upgraded a low pressure area to a tropical depression west of Guam, and the JTWC issued a TCFA. The system gradually drifted north and early on August 10, the JTWC started monitoring the system as a tropical depression and designated it with "13W". Initially, the JMA predicted the system to strengthen into a tropical storm, but on August 11, as it moved further north into cool waters and experienced unfavourable conditions, the JMA issued their final advisory. Later, the JTWC too issued their final warning on the system, reporting that it has moved into a subtropical ridge and was expected to dissipate into a remnant low. However, the JMA continued to track the remants as a weak tropical depression over the next few days until the system dissipated on August 15.

Late on August 8, the JMA upgraded an area of low pressure to a tropical depression, to the northwest of Minamitorishima. The system gradually moved to the northeast. On August 10, the system was caught in a moderate vertical wind shear and due to cold sea surface temperature, the system dissipated into a remnant low. 

On August 19, a low pressure area developed east-northeast of Guam. Early on August 20, the system developed a broad area of low level circulation center and a good divergence aloft becoming more well defined. Later that day, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression southeast of the Bonin Islands. On August 22, the system started interacting with an anticyclone and was exposed to a strong vertical wind shear, prompting the JMA to stop monitoring the system as a tropical depression, as the system dissipated to a remnant low. However, at midnight, the same day, the remnants regenerated, and the JMA started tracking the system as a tropical depression again, until it last appeared near Okinawa, Japan on August 25, as the system dissipated completely.
Late on August 19, an area of low pressure developed north of Palau. Early on August 20, the system became more better organized and developed a low-level circulation center. The system then turned north and continued to drift north until on August 21, when the JMA upgraded the low pressure area to a tropical depression east of Philippines. The JTWC also issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the system reporting that the system was becoming more well organized. Later that day, the PAGASA started monitoring the system as a tropical depression and named it "Mina". Late on August 22, the system became more well organized prompting the JTWC to initiate advisories on the system, designating it with "14W". On August 23, the JMA upgraded 14W to a tropical storm, naming it "Nanmadol". Overnight, the system continued to intensify and early on August 24, the JMA upgraded Nanmadol to a severe tropical storm. Later that day, convective banding improved and Nanmadol developed an eye-like feature. As a result, Nanmadol continued to intensify rapidly and became a typhoon, by midnight, that day. Nanmadol continued to drift north east and made landfall over Gonzaga, Cagayan, Philippines with strong winds of over . Nanmadol weakened significantly after interacting with land and early on August 28, the JMA downgraded Nanmadol to a severe tropical storm. Late on August 28, Nanmadol made its second landfall over Taimali in the Taitung County of Taiwan and started weakening. Landfall weakened the system rapidly prompting the JMA to downgrade Nanmadol to a tropical storm with winds of under . Soon it started experiencing strong wind shear and continued weakening. The shear pushed convection approximately south of the LLCC. The system also accelerated towards China at and weakened to a minimal tropical storm. After its third landfall over Fujian, China, Nanmadol weakened rapidly prompting both the JTWC and the JMA to issue their final warnings on the system.

On August 27, five people died after Nanmadol caused landslides. At least two Filipino fishermen were reported to be missing after Nanmadol's strong winds whipped up large waves.
Late on August 22, an area of low pressure developed to the west of Guam. At midnight that day, the system became sufficiently well organized that the JMA started tracking it as a tropical depression. On August 23, the system moved into an environment of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures prompting the JTWC to issued a TCFA on it. By August 25, the system grew strong enough that the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm, naming it "Talas". Later that day, the JTWC followed suit and initiated advisories on Talas. Talas continued to strengthen and by midnight that day, it became a severe tropical storm. Over the next few days, Talas continued to drift north very slowly until late on August 29, when the JMA upgraded Talas to a typhoon. Soon, a subtropical ridge to the west of the storm weakened and the subtropical ridge to the east of the system pushed Talas to the west. As a result, Talas accelerated towards the west maintaining strength and outflow. An upper-level cyclone over the system suppressed the convection and kept it from reaching the center. Therefore, Talas remained weak and did not strengthen further. Convection never managed to consolidate the center and convective banding remained well away from the fully exposed low-level circulation center. The convective banding continued to expand more and more with the outer rainbands already brushing parts of Japan. Coastal areas in the nation have already reported gale force winds several hours before landfall, while the Omega block continued to drive Talas towards the nation. Land interaction weakened Talas, prompting the JMA to downgrade Talas from a typhoon to a severe tropical storm with winds of under . Early on September 3, Talas made landfall over Aki, Japan. After landfall, Talas accelerated north at over and its central convection became significantly eroded and was displaced to the north-east as Talas was exposed to a very strong wind shear of over that made the LLCC very distorted and difficult to pin-point. Talas was embedded in a baroclinic zone and the JTWC anticipated an extratropical transition, which prompted them to issue their final warning on the system. On September 5, the JMA issued their final warning on the system, reporting that Talas has become extratropical on the Sea of Japan. 

On September 1, a low pressure area formed to the northeast of Guam. On the next day, the JMA started monitoring the low pressure area as a tropical depression. Soon, the system developed a well-defined but partially exposed low-level circulation center (LLCC), prompting the JTWC to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert. On September 3, the central convection around the LLCC deepened with favorable equatoward outflow prompting the JTWC to initiate advisories on the system, designating it with "16W". Soon, 16W accelerated north at over with its LLCC being being consolidated by convection. Also, data from an ASCAT scatterometer pass revealed that the LLCC was tightly wrapped with winds prompting the JTWC to upgrade 16W to a tropical storm. An Aqua microwave imagery depicted that the LLCC remained partially exposed though consolidated with deep central convection. Albeit in an area of moderate vertical wind shear, an anticyclone enhanced north-eastward outflow while a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT cell) suppressed the outflow towards the west. As 16W continued to accelerate north at a staggering , convective banding became fragmented and detached behind the main area of central convection. However, the outflow to the southeast of the storm remained favorable and 16W continued to strengthen, prompting the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, naming it "Noru".

Late on September 4, Noru's LLCC that remained partially exposed since formation unexpectedly became elongated and started weakening. However, data from an ASCAT scatterometer pass depicted that the LLCC had an expansive area of strong tropical storm force winds along the eastern and northern peripheries. A TUTT cell wrapped the east and northeastern sides of Noru suppressing its outflow. Soon, the convective banding, which was already fragmented started becoming disorganized causing Noru to start weakening. A new TUTT cell developed over the system and started restraining outflow. As a result, the LLCC became fully exposed and virtually lacked convection. The TUTT cell moved over Noru snuffing outflow in all directions and sheared the remnant central convection, prompting the JTWC to downgrade Noru to a tropical depression. However, data from an scatterometer pass depicted that Noru had winds of over near the center, prompting the JTWC to reupgrade the system to a tropical storm. On September 5, Noru started to appear like a hybrid system, primarily showing subtropical characteristics. The JTWC added that Noru was undergoing an extratropical transition and would become an extratropical cyclone within 24 hours. Noru continued to transition into an extratropical cyclone with a broadening LLCC and weaker winds at the core, being embedded in an upper-level trough that suppressed the formation of convection within the LLCC. With the extratropical transition well underway, Noru drifted into an area of low sea surface temperatures and started weakening, prompting the JTWC to downgrade Noru to a tropical depression. On September 6, Noru finished the extratropical transition becoming an extratropical cyclone east-southeast of Hokkaido, Japan, prompting the JMA and the JTWC to issue their final warning on the system. 

Late on September 4, an area of low pressure developed to the southeast of Okinawa, Japan. Over the next two days, the system drifted north and developed a well defined LLCC with organized convective banding, prompting the JMA to upgrade the low pressure area to a tropical depression. On September 7, convection consolidated the low-level circulation center very well with tightly curved banding wrapped into it. Also, high sea-surface temperatures and very low wind shear caused the system to undergo rapid deepening, prior to which, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it "Kulap". However, the system stopped strengthening soon after as the LLCC became partially exposed and the convection was displaced to the south. Kulap remained small in size and dry air entering from the western periphery kept it from strengthening further. Wind shear increased, pushing convection approximately south of the LLCC. Also, Kulap was located beneath a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT cell) that caused subsidence. A mid-level subtropical steering ridge cuased Kulap to track in a northwestward direction. On September 8, Kulap moved into the east-northeast periphery of the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) prompting the PAGASA to start issuing advisories on the system, naming it "Nonoy". However, Kulap quickly accelerated north and exited the PAR on the same evening, prompting the PAGASA to issued their final advisory on the system. After increasing wind shear caused further weakening, the JTWC downgraded Kulap to a tropical depression late on September 8. Early on September 10, the JMA too downgraded Kulap to a tropical depression, and continued to track Kulap's remnants as a tropical depression until it finally dissipated early on September 11.
Early on September 8, a cluster of thunderstorms came together as a low pressure area with imporoving outflow and a developing low-level circulation center (LLCC). Later that day, the JMA upgraded the low pressure area to a tropical depression north-northeast of the Northern Mariana Islands. Over the next two days, the system gradually drifted west and intensified slightly, prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on it. Convection gradually consolidated the LLCC and the JTWC initiated advisories on the system on September 11, designating it with "18W". The next day, the depression drifted into the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) and the PAGASA initiated advisories on the depression, naming it "Onyok". However, just as similar to Kulap, Onyok also exited the PAR in 6 hours from entering the region. In an advisory, the JTWC reported that there were at-least two more vortices associated with the system, that caused an abrupt, erratic movement. However, being located in an area of warm sea surface temperatures and low vertical wind shear, the depression continued to strengthen and on September 13, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and named it "Roke". On September 17, Roke developed a small, deep convective eye promoting the JMA to upgrade Roke to a severe tropical storm with winds of over . Between September 19 and 20, Roke underwent "Explosive intensification", a more extreme case of rapid deepening that involves a tropical cyclone deepening at a rate of at least 2.5 mbar per hour for a minimum of 12 hours. Also, they added that Roke developed a eye and a good poleward outflow channel. On September 21, Typhoon Roke made landfall over Hamamatsu, Japan at about 5:00 UTC (14:00 JST). Soon Roke started weakening as cloud tops started getting warmed up and eye diameter started to decrease. However, the system still maintained a near radial outflow and the convective structure continued to remain organized that kept Roke from dissipating rapidly. Although Roke entered a de-intensification phase, it still had plenty of strength that posed a great threat to regions of Japan. Being located approximately southwest of Yokosuka, Kanagawa, the typhoon accelerated north-northwestward at approximately with winds of over (1-min sustained) being a Category 3 typhoon on the SSHS. Being embedded in the baroclinic zone, Roke started its extratropical transition. Also, land interaction severely weakened the storm to a minimal Category 1 typhoon with winds of under (1-min sustained). Only six hours later, the storm further weakened and accelerated northeastward at approximately with rapidly dissipating deep convection completely sheared to the northeast of the LLCC. As a result, the JTWC ceased advisories on the storm, as it became fully extratropical.

Early on September 13, a low pressure area formed northeast of the Northern Mariana Islands. The system gradually drifted north and steadily intensified until the next day when the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression. Later on September 14, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the system reporting that the system could intensify into a tropical storm within 24 hours from then. Convection rapidly consolidated the center with persistent, deep convection around the north-eastern periphery, prompting the JTWC to initiate advisories on the system, designating it with "19W". Soon, the JMA also initiated advisories on the system, upgrading it to Tropical Storm "Sonca". In the begging, Sonca seemed to have intensified rapidly since formation, however, soon the storm weakened back to a minimal tropical storm because of dry air entering the LLCC that caused it to elongate and weaken. However, that was not for too long as vigorous convection persisted over the well defined LLCC with tightly curved banding wrapped in, Sonca continued to strengthen gradually and the JTWC reported winds of at-least near the center. As Sonca continued to strengthen, and the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm on September 17. Later that day, Sonca developed a large ragged eye with deep convective banding tightly wrapped into it. As a result, Sonca strengthened more rapidly and by early the next day, it became a typhoon. On September 18, Sonca reached a peak intensity of (1-min mean) and (10-min mean) and soon the convection around the northern periphery started weakening. Being embedded in a baroclinic zone with low sea surface temperatures, Sonca started its extratropical transition late on September 19. The transition took place relatively fast because of a frontal boundary and the JTWC reported that Sonca became extratropical early on September 20, while the JMA did the same later in the evening. 

Early on September 14, the JMA started monitoring a cluster of thunderstorms located to the southeast of Taiwan as a tropical depression. However, due to land interaction, the system could not strengthen and the JMA stopped tracking the depression late on September 15, as the system dissipated.

In the evening of September 21, a low pressure area developed to the east-southeast of Palau. The low gradually drifted west and became more well organized prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on it. Later, the LLCC became well organized with flaring deep convection developing around it, so the JMA started monitoring the low as a tropical depression. Later on September 23, the JTWC also initiated advisories on the system designating it with "20W". Early on September 24, the JMA further upgraded 20W to a tropical storm and named it "Nesat". Nesat continued to drift west with expanding deep convection around the entire system and consolidating convection around the LLCC. The mid-level warm anomaly near the system continued to intensify and convective banding near the LLCC became more and more tighter. As a result, the JMA upgraded Nesat to a severe tropical storm on September 25. Late on the same day, the JMA further upgraded Nesat to a typhoon. 

As of 09:45 UTC September 26, Typhoon Nesat was located within 30 nautical miles of , about east-northeast of Manila, Philippines. Maximum sustained winds are , gusting to . Minimum central pressure is 965 mbar (hPa; 28.50 InHg), and the system is moving west-northwest at . 

For latest official information see:
On the evening of September 21, at almost the same time when Nesat was first seen, another low pressure area persisted far south of Hong Kong. The low slowly drifted north and strengthened slowly until on September 24, when the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression east of Vietnam. Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert stating that the low could develop into a tropical cyclone. Early on September 25, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it "Haitang".

As of 10:00 UTC September 26, Tropical Storm Haitang was located within 30 nautical miles of , about east of Huế, Vietnam. Maximum sustained winds are , gusting to . Minimum central pressure is 998 mbar (hPa; 29.47 InHg), and the system is moving west-northwest slowly.

For latest official information see:
Within the Northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies who assign names to tropical cyclones which often results in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency names tropical cyclones should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km/h, (40 mph), to the north of the equator between the 180° and 100°E. Whilst the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N-25°N even if the cyclone has had a name assigned to it by the Japan Meteorological Agency.

Tropical Cyclones are named from the following lists by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in Tokyo, Japan, once they reach tropical storm strength. Names are contributed by members of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee. Each of the 14 nations or territories submitted 10 names, which are used in alphabetical order, by the English name of the country. The next 24 names on the naming list are listed here.

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration uses its own naming scheme for tropical cyclones in their area of responsibility. PAGASA assigns names to tropical depressions that form within their area of responsibility and any tropical cyclone that might move into their area of responsibility. Should the list of names for a given year prove to be insufficient, names are taken from an auxiliary list, the first 10 of which are published each year before the season starts.

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) announced that the names "Bebeng", "Juaning" and "Mina" would be stricken off their Tropical Cyclone Naming lists due to extensive damage and loss of life.

This table lists all the storms that developed in the western Pacific Ocean to the west of the International Date Line during the 2011 season. It includes their intensity, duration, name, landfalls, deaths, and damages. All damage figures are in 2011 USD. Damages and deaths from a storm include when the storm was a precursor wave or extratropical low.

The table on the right shows the ACE for each storm in the season. Broadly speaking, the ACE is a measure of the power of a typhoon multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong typhoons, have high ACEs. ACE is calculated for only full advisories on specifically tropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 34 knots (63 km/h, 39 mph), or tropical storm strength. Accordingly, tropical depressions are not included here. The ACE also does not include subtropical storms. Later the JMA reexamines the data, and produces a final report on each storm, which can lead to the ACE for a storm being revised either upward or downward. Until the final reports are issued, ACEs are, therefore, provisional.

Stage (geology)

A stage or age in geology is a period of time measured in millions of years. It is less than an epoch, and more than a chron or chronozone.

Technically, a "stage" is a succession of rock strata laid down in a single age on the geologic timescale, which usually represents millions of years of deposition.

Red beds

The term red beds usually refers to strata of reddish-colored sedimentary rocks such as sandstone, siltstone or shale that were deposited in hot climates under oxidizing conditions. They are usually formed in terrestrial situations: on land, and in rivers and lakes. 

The red color comes from iron oxide in their mineral structure. Although they have been deposited throughout the Phanerozoic, they are most commonly associated with rocks deposited during the Devonian, Permian and Triassic periods. The Old Red Sandstone is one of the most famous rock formations.

Red beds have economic significance since many of them contain reservoirs of petroleum and natural gas.

Secondary red beds are linked to the uplift, erosion and surface weathering of previously deposited sediments and require conditions similar to primary red beds for their formation.

First Minister and deputy First Minister

The First Minister and the deputy First Minister (Irish: "Céad-Aire agus an leas-Chéad-Aire", Ulster Scots: "Heid Männystèr an tha Heid Männystèr depute"), (FM/dFM for short), are jobs in the Northern Ireland Government. The First Minister is not more important than the deputy First Minister. The two positions are a diarchy, meaning they have equal power; both are nominated and appointed by members of the Northern Ireland Assembly.

The incumbents are Peter Robinson of the Democratic Unionist Party as First Minister and Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin as deputy First Minister.

Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly are divided into two groups, Nationalists and Unionists (although there are also some independent or "Other" members).

The First Minister and the deputy First Minister are elected on a joint ticket. Under the St Andrews Agreement, the Leader of the largest party nominates the First Minister, and the leader of the next largest party that is in the other group nominates the deputy First Minister. 

Their joint nomination has to obtain an overall majority in the Assembly along with a majority of both designated Nationalist MLAs and designated Unionist MLAs. Designated Other MLAs also vote.

This diarchy was created to enable the leaders of the main unionist and nationalist parties to work together as a team jointly representing both communities.

The first two holders of the office now known as "deputy First Minister", namely Seamus Mallon and Mark Durkan, were both referred to during their periods of office as "Deputy First Minister", with a capital D. This version was also adopted in 1999 for the logo of the OFMDFM. 

Several weeks after Martin McGuinness took up office as Deputy First Minister in 2007, civil servants began asking the Assembly's Hansard team to replace the capital D with a lower-case d, deputy was spelled this way in the Northern Ireland Act 1998, the legislation which created the office. 

It was neither Mr McGuinness nor his advisers who asked for the change. The Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, William Hay, ordered the change and the capital D was dropped from Hansard references. The Office of the First and deputy First Minister still uses both versions of Mr McGuinness' title on their website, and their archive of press releases has been changed, but the capital D still appears in some places, and a spokesman confirmed on 20 March 2008 that the office has "no plans" to change the OFMDFM logo. However, the Assembly committee that looks at their work is now listed as the "Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister". It was decided that Mr McGuinness should be the deputy First Minister, unless all the other letters in the title are in capitals. Confusion isn't completely resolved however; if Mr McGuinness writes to the Assembly committee, his note will have a letterhead that comes from the Office of the First Minister and "Deputy" First Minister, but he'll get a reply back from the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and "deputy" First Minister.

Cold seep

A cold seep (sometimes called a cold vent) is an area of the ocean floor where hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich liquids leak out of the Earth's crust, often in the form of a brine pool. Cold seeps form a biome supporting several native species.

Cold seeps change the shape of the ocean floor over time, where reactions between methane and seawater create carbonate rock formations and reefs. These reactions may change when bacteria are present.

Cold seeps at different depths have different names. Other kinds of cold seeps are:

Cold seeps occur over cracks in the seafloor caused by the movement of the Earth's crust. Oil and methane "seep" out of those cracks, get dissolved by tiny bits of rock, and emerge over an area several hundred meters wide.

Methane () is the main part of what we commonly refer to as natural gas. But in addition to being an important energy source for humans, methane also forms the basis of a cold seep ecosystem.

Calamba City

Calamba City is a first class city in the province of Laguna, Philippines. Only 54 kilometers south of Manila, about an hour by chartered bus, Calamba City is a popular tourist destination with its hot spring resorts, most of which are in Barangay Pansol. The total count of the resorts in Calamba City was 651 resorts and hot springs. The Canlubang Golf and Country Club, site of many Philippine Opens. Calamba is also an important modern industrial center in the CALABARZON region as shown by the large number of industrial parks and business estates that are in the city. According to the latest census, it has a population of 360,281 inhabitants in 58,466 households, making it the most populated town in Laguna province, with San Pedro, Santa Rosa City, Biñan City, and San Pablo City following it as the top 5 municipalities and cities with the highest population in the province.

Calamba City is the birthplace of José Rizal, the country's national hero.

Calamba City is the regional center of CALABARZON.

The name of the city comes from a legend that during the early time of the Spanish period in the country, two "guardias civil" or soldiers were lost and passing through what is now Calamba. The soldiers met a young lady who came from a river carrying a jar of water and a wooden stove. The soldiers unwittingly in Spanish language and in authoritative tone, to conceal the fact that they were lost, asked the local maiden the name of the place they were in. The lady, who speaks only her native language, naturally thought she was being interrogated about what she was carrying and nervously uttered ""kalan-banga"", meaning "clay stove" (kalan) and "water jar" (banga). Because the Spaniards could not pronounce it properly, the town has been called Calamba supposedly since then. This legend is immortalized with a large concrete water jar erected in the city plaza with the names of the city's barangays written on its surface. It is considered the World's Biggest "Claypot". This same jar is also in the city's seal. The plaza was proposed by Dr. Agapito Alzona, then the town councilor to utilize the waste area where the old town market relocated from. The resolution was approved by the then town mayor Roman Lazaro and added additional P5,000 for the fence to the original P15,000 construction cost. It was completed in 1939.

Before it became a separate town, Calamba was then a part of Tabuco, now known as Cabuyao. Calamba became an independent "pueblo" on August 28, 1742.

During the Japanese occupation in World War II, the city was the theater of a massacre during which the Imperial Japanese Army killed at least 2,000 civilians.

With the passage of Republic Act No. 9024 on April 7, 2001 and the approval of the residents in a plebiscite on April 21, Calamba was promoted from a municipality into Laguna's second component city after San Pablo. A proclaimed city dated April 7, 2001, Calamba is identified as a major growth center and is extremely well positioned to be such. Its highly strategic location, being in a major crossroad in the Region, augurs well for the development of regional facilities. Current and proposed projects, as identified in several government and private sector plans, further strengthen the municipality’s position as major hub in governance, manufacturing, trading, and transshipment. Its sub-urbanization is also well entrenched being the proposed site of major residential community projects and well-established learning institutions.

On October 28, 2003, effected on the Executive Order 246, Calamba City was designated as the regional center of Region IV-A CALABARZON.

Calamba boasts no less than five national heroes: Dr. Jose Rizal, General Paciano Rizal, Teodora Alonzo, General Vicente Lim, and Lt. Geronimo Aclan.

On the other hand, the major church in Calamba City is the St. John the Baptist Church established in 1859. It was burned by the Japanese during World War II. It was reconstructed by Fr. Eliseo Dimaculangan. It was the christening site of Jose Rizal. The original baptismal font has been preserved and refurvished.

2010 saw the begin of ClickonWales.org, the IWA’s online news-analysis magazine. ClickonWales is designed to bring users a new level of regular commentary and analysis on Welsh affairs, and opportunities for debate. Expert contributors and commentators from across the political spectrum will be commissioned daily. The site also features the ‘Wales factfile’ and the ‘Lecture Library’. Wales factfile is a handy one-stop shop for information and data about many aspects of Wales and its economic, social, cultural and political life. The ‘Lecture Library’ is a place where organisations will be able to post
the texts of public lectures on a wide range of subjects.

The Institute of Welsh Affairs was created on 22 July 1987 (Company No: 02151006).

The IWA is a membership based organisation, it has approximately 1,200 individual and 150 corporate members, and more than 100 Fellows.
The corporate members include BBC Wales, British Gas, Cardiff County Council, Corus Steel, Eversheds, Julian Hodge Bank, ITV Wales, the 
Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, S4C, Welsh Water, and the University of Wales.

The Institute is governed by a Board of Trustees. Its first chairman was Henry Kroch, then chairman of AB Electronics. Since 1992, the chairman has been Geraint Talfan Davies, and since 1996 the director of the organisation has been former journalist and television producer, John Osmond.

As at November 2010, the Board members were Eurfyl ap Gwilym, Guy Clarke, Rhys David, Geraint Talfan Davies (Chairman), Peter Davies, Sue Essex, Nigel Griffiths, Gerald Holtham, Megan Mathias, Rob Humphreys, Robert Jolliffe, Ruth Marks, Chris O'Malley, Wendy Sadler, Professor John Tucker, Sir Adrian Webb, Dr. Ruth Williams and Professor Laura McAllister.

The IWA has five area branches – for north Wales, for west Wales, Swansea Bay, Gwent, and Cardiff and the Valleys. A sixth 'virtual' branch - IWA Women - has been formed to raise the profile of women's concerns in Wales and to increase the engagement of women with the IWA and civil society in Wales more generally.

Approximately one third of the IWA's income is derived from membership subscriptions, the remainder coming mainly from the funding of specific research projects by trusts and foundations, and other public and private organisations.

The IWA publishes a journal three times a year (in spring, summer and winter), called "Agenda". First published in 1994, "Agenda" contains numerous articles on current issues in Wales, written by experts in their field, including academics, politicians and business people, and a wide range of participants from Welsh civil society.

It now publishes a regular bulletin on developments in the Assembly, "Assembly Bwletin Cynulliad", published in association with Grayling Wales. These can be downloaded from clickonwales.org. In addition, the IWA has published a multitude of research reports, discussion papers and books.

One of the IWA’s central activities is holding events which are designed to disseminate information to the public on a host of public policy issues. The events range from the smaller ‘coffee shop’ debates to full-scale conferences. 

Typically, an IWA event will focus on a contested issue in Welsh politics. It will bring in an expert (or number of experts) who have detailed knowledge and understanding of the issue, to clearly present both side’s arguments clearly. This is inline with the first part of it’s mission, which to help raise the level of public debate on issues affecting Wales, by placing quality information in the public domain. 

In 2010 the IWA began the Inspire Wales Awards, in association with the Western Mail . The Awards aim to raise the profile of Welsh men and women who are making a contribution to our society, to encourage active citizenship and create role models for others. Categories for the awards include the environment, business, education, sport, and arts, media and the creative industries. 2011 sees the IWA/Western Mail Business Awards, celebrating business achievement in Wales.

In November 2006 the IWA published a report entitled "Time to Deliver: The Third Term and Beyond". This looked at policy options for the Assembly’s third term, and was the result of work by eight study groups in individual policy areas. 

In 2010 the IWA's director, John Osmond was asked by the Older People's Commissioner to carry out a study exploring Welsh policy responses to our rapidly ageing society, in particular the Welsh Government’s policy which has been developing in a number of innovative ways since 2003. The findings were published in the bilingual report, 'Adding Life to Years / Ychwanegu Bywyd at a y Blynyddoedd'.

The IWA's most recent publication, entitled 'Engaging Wales' disengaged youth', explores the issue of so-called 'NEETS' - Children Not in Education, Employment of Training. It contains contributions from experts in the fields of youth policy, education, employment, and youth-centred charities. A full list of the IWA's research outputs is available on its website. 

The IWA's priority areas for its future work include economic development, the environment and climate change, education, health and culture, governance and civil society.

Table Mountain

Table Mountain is a flat-topped mountain overlooking the city of Cape Town in South Africa. It is 1084.6 metres in height.

It is a significant tourist attraction, featured in the flag of Cape Town and other local government insignia. Many visitors use the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway or hike to the top. The mountain forms part of the Table Mountain National Park.

The upper part of the mountain "mesa" (table) consists Silurian/Ordovician quartzitic sandstone, commonly referred to as Table Mountain Sandstone (TMS). It is highly resistant to weathering and forms steep grey crags. 

Below the sandstone is a layer of micaceous shale, which weathers quite readily. The basement of folded metamorphic shales intruded by the Cape Granite are of late Precambrian age.

Fingal's Cave

Fingal's Cave is a sea cave on the uninhabited island of Staffa, in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland, part of a National Nature Reserve owned by the National Trust for Scotland. It is formed entirely from hexagonally jointed basalt columns. These are part of the same ancient lava flow as the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland and those of nearby Ulva. 

In both cases, the cooling surface of the mass of hot lava cracked in a hexagonal pattern in a similar way to drying mud cracking as it shrinks. These cracks slowly extended down into the mass of lava as it cooled and shrank to form the columns, which were later exposed by erosion.

The breakup of Pangaea separated the two parts of the same rock formation.

The size of the cave, and its naturally arched roof, and the eerie sounds produced by the echoes of waves, give it the atmosphere of a natural cathedral. The cave's Gaelic name, Uamh-Binn, means "cave of melody."

Romantic composer Felix Mendelssohn visited in 1829 and wrote "Die Hebriden" (in English, "Hebrides Overture Opus 26", commonly known as "Fingal's Cave overture"), inspired by the weird echoes in the cave. Mendelssohn's overture popularized the cave as a tourist destination. Other famous 19th-century visitors included author Jules Verne; poets William Wordsworth, John Keats, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson; and Romantic artist J.M.W. Turner, who painted "Staffa, Fingal's Cave" in 1832. Queen Victoria also made the trip.

Deadpool, known as Wade Wilson is a made up character from Marvel Comics. He was created by Rob Leifeld in 1991. He is still often seen in comics and most recently as a supervillain who is in the end of the movie X-Men Origins: Wolverine. He is the property of Marvel Comics, and is shown in many of their comic books. His clothing is colored red and black, and he has two guns and short katanas. He is famous for frequently breaking the fourth wall, such as referring to past events as "issues ago" and such.

Villain

A villain is a bad person. Villains are usually found in fiction, such as books and movies. The audience do not usually like the villain and they support the hero or heroine. In some movies and books (such as the movie Ocean's Eleven), the villain is a good person and the hero/heroine is bad (such as a robber). When used in comic books, they are depicted as super-villains. Super-villains usually hold some kind of unnatural force.

Giant's Causeway

The Giant's Causeway is an area of about 40,000 interlocking basalt columns, the result of an ancient volcanic eruption. It is located in County Antrim on the northeast coast of Northern Ireland. 

It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986, and a National Nature Reserve in 1987 by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland. In a 2005 poll of "Radio Times" readers, the Giant's Causeway was named as the fourth greatest natural wonder in the United Kingdom. 

The tops of the columns form stepping stones that lead from the cliff foot and disappear under the sea. Most of the columns are hexagonal, although there are also some with four, five, seven and eight sides. The tallest are about 12 metres (36 ft) high, and the solidified lava in the cliffs is 28 metres thick in places.

The Giant's Causeway is today owned and managed by the National Trust and it is the most popular tourist attraction in Northern Ireland.

The Giant's Causeway and Fingal's Cave are part of the same volcanic eruption. They were separated by the plate tectonics movements which happened when the supercontinent Pangaea broke up.

Some 50 to 60 million years ago, during the Paleogene period, Antrim was subject to intense volcanic activity, when highly fluid molten basalt intruded through chalk beds to form an extensive lava plateau. As the lava cooled rapidly, contraction occurred. The size of the columns is primarily determined by the speed at which lava from a volcanic eruption cools. The extensive fracture network produced the distinctive columns seen today. The basalts were originally part of a great volcanic plateau called the Thulean Plateau which formed during the Paleogene period. Parts of this plateau can be found in the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Norway, as well as at Fingal's Cave.

An ornithopter from the ancient greek language is an aircraft that flies by flapping its wings. Designers try to make the flapping-wing flight of birds, bats, and insects seem real. Though machines may differ in form, they are usually built on the same scale as these flying creatures. Manned ornithopters have also been built, and some have worked. The machines are of two general types: those with engines, and those powered by the muscles of the pilot.

Juggling is a skill which throwing objects for enjoyment or sport. The juggler throws objects up to catch and throw up again. Jugglers often call the objects they juggle as props. The most common props are balls or beanbags, rings, clubs, and special bounce balls. Some performers use more dangerous objects such as knives, fire torches, and even chainsaws.

Juggling can also mean other prop-based skills such as diabolo, devil sticks, poi, cigar boxes, fire-dancing, contact juggling, hooping, foot bag and hat manipulation.

3753 Cruithne

3753 Cruithne is an asteroid.

3753 Cruithne was discovered on October 10, 1986, by Duncan Waldron on the UK Schmidt Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory, Coonabarabran, Australia. The 1983 appearance is given to Giovanni de Sanctis and Richard M. West of the European Southern Observatory in Chile. It was not until 1997 that its unusual orbit was found by Paul Wiegert and Kimmo Innanen, working at York University in Toronto, and Seppo Mikkola, working at the University of Turku in Finland. The asteroid is named after the Cruithne, a people of early medieval Ireland.

3753 Cruithne is about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) in diameter. From 1994 through 2015, 3753 Cruithne makes its annual closest approach to Earth every November. Although Cruithne's orbit is not thought to be stable over the long term, calculations showed that it has probably been synchronized with Earth's orbit for a long time. There is no danger of a collision with Earth for millions of years, if ever. Its orbital path and Earth's do not cross.

Cruithne is in a normal elliptic orbit around the Sun. Its period of revolution around the Sun, about 364 days at present, is almost equal to that of the Earth. Because of this, Cruithne and Earth appear to follow each other in their paths around the Sun. This is why Cruithne is sometimes called "Earth's second moon". However, it does not orbit the Earth and is not a moon. In 2058, Cruithne will come within 13.6 million kilometres of Mars. Cruithne's distance from the Sun and orbital speed vary a lot more than the Earth's, so from the Earth's point of view Cruithne actually follows a kidney bean-shaped horseshoe orbit ahead of the Earth, taking slightly less than one year to complete a circuit of the "bean". Because it takes slightly less than a year, the Earth "falls behind" the bean a little more each year, and so from our point of view, the circuit is not quite closed, but rather like a spiral loop that moves slowly away from the Earth.
After many years, the Earth will have fallen so far behind that Cruithne will then actually be "catching up" on the Earth from "behind". When it eventually does catch up, Cruithne will make a series of annual close approaches to the Earth and gravitationally exchange orbital energy with Earth; this will alter Cruithne's orbit by a little over half a million kilometres so that its period of revolution around the Sun will then become slightly more than a year. The kidney bean will then start to migrate away from the Earth again in the opposite direction — instead of the Earth "falling behind" the bean, the Earth is "pulling away from" the bean. The next such series of close approaches will be centred on the year 2292 — in July of that year, Cruithne will approach Earth to about 12,500,000 kilometres.
After 380 to 390 years or so, the kidney-bean-shaped orbit approaches Earth again from the other side, and the Earth, once more, alters the orbit of Cruithne so that its period of revolution around the Sun is again slightly less than a year (this last happened with a series of close approaches centred on 1902, and will next happen with a series centered on 2676). The pattern then repeats itself.

More resonant near-Earth objects (NEOs) have since been discovered. These include 54509 YORP, (85770) 1998 UP1, 2002 AA29, and 2009BD which exist in resonant orbits similar to Cruithne's.
Other examples of natural bodies known to be in horseshoe orbits include Janus and Epimetheus, natural satellites of Saturn. The orbits these two moons follow around Saturn are much simpler than the one Cruithne follows, but operate along the same general principles.
Mars has four known co-orbital asteroids (5261 Eureka, 1999 UJ7, 1998 VF31, and 2007 NS2, all at the Lagrangian points), and Jupiter has many (more than 1000 known objects, the Trojan asteroids); there are also other small co-orbital moons in the Saturnian system: Telesto and Calypso with Tethys, and Helene and Polydeuces with Dione. However, none of these follow horseshoe orbits.

Inner Hebrides

The Inner Hebrides is an archipelago off the west coast of Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. 

Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which enjoy a mild oceanic climate because the Gulf Stream runs past them. 

There are 36 inhabited islands and a further 43 uninhabited Inner Hebrides with an area greater than . The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing, and whisky distilling. 

Combined, the islands have an area of approximately , and had a population of 18,257 people in 2001. The population density is therefore a little over 4 persons per km (11 persons per square mile).

There are various important prehistoric structures, many of which pre-date the first written references to the islands by Roman and Greek authors. 

In the historic period the earliest known settlers were Picts to the north and Gaels in the south. The islands became part of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, the "Suðreyjar" kingdom of the Norse. The Norsemen ruled for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266. 

Control of the islands was then held by various clan chiefs, principal of which were the Clan MacLeod and Clan MacDonald. The Highland Clearances of the 19th century had a devastating effect on many communities and it is only in recent years that population levels have ceased to decline.

Sea transport is crucial and ferry services operate between the islands and the mainland Britain. The Gaelic language and the Wee Free Church of Scotland remains strong in some areas. The landscapes have inspired a variety of artists, and there is a diversity of wildlife.

Skye, Mull and Islay are the largest islands.

There are also many small, uninhabited islands. One of the uninhabited isles, Staffa, is home to Fingal's Cave and basalt columns.

The second type started being made in 2008 and is still being made today. This type looks much rounder and it is more powerful than the first type of car. This type is also not as popular because it is a more generic type of car. There has been a lot of criticism about the second type of Scion xB because of this reason. Also, many original xB owners despise the xB2 even being called an xB. The xB2 has its own name in other markets. Scion used the xB name in an attempt to help sell it in America.

Earthquake protector

Earthquake protector is a type of base isolation made to protect building and non-building structures against damage from strong earthquakes.

A building's seismic performance may be improved by reducing vibrations. This may be done with damping mechanisms in vibration control technologies and especially in base isolation. 

However, for the very pliant systems such as base isolated structures, with a relatively low bearing stiffness but with a high damping, the so-called "damping force" may turn out the main pushing force at a strong earthquake. This finding created a theoretical ground in earthquake engineering for a damping-disengaged base isolation technology called Earthquake protector.

Storegga Slide

The three Storegga Slides are amongst the largest known landslides. They occurred under water, at the edge of Norway's continental shelf, in the Norwegian Sea, 100 km north-west of the Møre coast. 

This caused a very large tsunami in the North Atlantic Ocean. The collapse involved an estimated 290 km length of coastal shelf, with a total volume of 3,500 km of debris. 

Based on carbon dating of plant material recovered from sediment deposited by the tsunami, the latest incident occurred around 6100 BC. In Scotland, traces of this tsunami have been recorded, with deposited sediment being discovered in the Montrose Basin (estuary of the South Esk river), and the Firth of Forth, up to 80 km inland and 4 metres above current normal tide levels. 

As part of the activities to prepare the Ormen Lange natural gas field, the incident has been thoroughly investigated. One conclusion is that the slide was caused by material built up during the previous ice age, and that a recurrence would only be possible after a new ice age. This conclusion is supported by numerous scientific studies. Facts and arguments supporting this conclusion were made public in 2004. 

It was decided that the development of the Ormen Lange gas field would not significantly increase the risk of triggering a new slide. A new slide would trigger a very large tsunami which would be devastating for the coast areas around the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea.

Brett Skinner

Brett Skinner (born June 28, 1983 in Brandon, Manitoba) is a professional ice hockey defenceman currently playing in the Russian Kontinental Hockey League with Amur Khabarovsk.

Skinner was drafted by the Vancouver Canucks 68th overall in the 3rd round of the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. Brett was a member of the Trail Smoke Eaters in the BCHL in 2000–01, the Des Moines Buccaneers in the USHL in 2001–02, and then the University of Denver from 2002–2005. As a Denver Pioneer, he was a member of two NCAA national championship winning teams, was named an All-American in 2004–05. He was named team captain for what would have been his senior year at Denver (2005–06) but signed his first professional contract with the Canucks on August 30, 2005, and made his pro debut with affiliate, the Manitoba Moose of the AHL, in the 2005–06 season. At the trade deadline, Skinner was traded by the Canucks, along with a 2nd round pick to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim for Keith Carney and Juha Alen on March 9, 2006. Despite being dealt, Skinner remained on loan with the Moose until the end of the season. 

Brett spent the 2006–07 season, playing with the Augusta Lynx, Portland Pirates and the Omaha Ak-Sar-Ben Knights. He was traded by the Ducks, along with Nathan Saunders, to the Boston Bruins for Mark Mowers just prior to the 2007–08 season on September 24, 2007. Skinner enjoyed a break out year with the Providence Bruins recording 47 points in 68 games and playing in the AHL All-Star game.

On July 3, 2008, Skinner was signed to a one-year contract by the New York Islanders. Brett was assigned to affiliate, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers of the AHL, to start the 2008–09 season. When a rash of injuries hit the Islanders, Skinner was recalled and made his NHL debut in a 4-2 defeat against the New York Rangers on October 27, 2008. Skinner played 11 games with the Isles before he was returned to the Sound Tigers. On January 13, 2009, Brett was traded by the Islanders to the Atlanta Thrashers for Junior Lessard. He was then assigned to affiliate, the Chicago Wolves, where he remained for the rest of the season.

On July 8, 2009, Skinner signed a one-year contract with the Colorado Avalanche. He was assigned to the Avalanche's AHL affiliate, the Lake Erie Monsters, for 2009–10. Skinner scored 28 points in 73 games for the Monsters. During the season on January 22, 2010, Skinner was re-called but did not debut with the Avalanche.

Skinner left North America as a free agent and signed a one-year contract with Russian team, Amur Khabarovsk, of the KHL on August 12, 2010.

Alex Smart

Alexander Smart (May 29, 1918 – April 18, 2005) was a Canadian ice hockey forward. He played one season for the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League and spent the majority of his career in the Quebec Senior Hockey League.

Born in Brandon, Manitoba, Smart played junior hockey in the Manitoba Junior Hockey League with the Portage Terriers for two seasons. In 1937–38, joined the senior ranks with the Toronto Marlboros of the Ontario Hockey Association and scored 23 points in 12 games at a goal-per-game pace. The following season, he began a three-year stint in the Montreal City Hockey League (MCHL) with the Verdun Maple Leafs and Montreal Sr. Canadiens.

In 1941–42, Smart moved with the Sr. Canadiens to the Quebec Senior Hockey League (QSHL). Affiliated with the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League, Smart was called up to the NHL in 1943 and, on January 14, became the first player in league history to score a hat trick in his NHL debut (this feat was later matched by Réal Cloutier of the Quebec Nordiques in 1979, Fabian Brunnström of the Dallas Stars in 2008, and Derek Stepan of the New York Rangers in 2010). He completed the season with 5 goals and 2 assists in 8 games – the lone NHL stint of his career. 

Smart spent the remainder of his career in the QSHL with the Montreal Royals and Ottawa Senators with the exception of one more season in the MCHL with the Montreal Vickers and the final season of his career in the OVHL with Eastview St. Charles.

Firth of Forth

The Firth of Forth is the estuary or "firth" of Scotland's River Forth. It flows into the North Sea, between Fife to the north, and West Lothian, the City of Edinburgh and East Lothian to the south. 

Geologically, the Firth of Forth is a fjord, formed by the Forth Glacier in the last glacial period. The river is tidal as far inland as Stirling. 

The Kincardine Bridge and the famous Forth Road Bridge and Forth Rail Bridge carry traffic across the Firth. A third crossing, next to the Kincardine Bridge, opened in 2008. On 1 October 2008 it was announced that the new bridge would be called the "Clackmannanshire Bridge".

In July 2007, a hovercraft passenger service completed a two week trial between Portobello, Edinburgh and Kirkcaldy, Fife. The trial of the service (marketed as "Forthfast") was hailed as a major operational success, with an average passenger load of 85%. If a permanent service comes into operation, it could cut congestion for commuters on the Forth road and rail bridges by carrying about 870,000 passengers a year.

The Northern Isles are a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland.

The group includes Shetland, Fair Isle and Orkney. Sometimes Stroma is included, which is part of Caithness.

The Northern Isles are usually separated for political purposes, but they come under the Orkney and Shetland parliamentary constituency in Westminster.

Due to their history, the islands have a Norse, rather than a Gaelic flavour, and have historic links with the Faroes, Iceland, and Norway.

Orkney and Shetland were given to Scotland as a deposit on the dowry of Margaret of Denmark when she married James III of Scotland in 1469.

Cam Newton

Cameron "Cam" Jerrell Newton (born May 11, 1989) is an American football quarterback. He played college football at Auburn University, where he won a BCS National Championship in 2011. He is now quarterback for the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL).
Newton was born in Savannah, Georgia to parents Cecil and Jackie Newton. His father also played professional football in the NFL. He grew up in College Park, Georgia. He attended Seaborn Lee Elementary School and then Camp Creek Middle School. In 2003, he attended Westlake High School in Fulton County, Georgia, where he played football and basketball.
In 2007, as a freshman at the University of Florida, Newton earned the spot over fellow freshman quarterback John Brantley as the back-up for star quarterback and eventual Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow. He played in five games and threw for 40 yards on 5-of-10 passing and ran the ball 16 times for 103 yards and three touchdowns. In 2008, during his sophomore season, Newton played in the season opener against Hawaii. He then suffered an ankle injury and decided to take a medical redshirt season. 

On November 21, 2008, police arrested Newton for stealing a laptop computer from a student at the University of Florida. He was subsequently temporarily suspended by the team after the laptop was in fact found to be in his possession. Investigators tracked the stolen laptop to the athlete. Newton tossed the computer out his dorm window in an attempt to hide it from the Police. (A friend scooped up the laptop and hid it behind a dumpster at a nearby school building). Newton was suspended indefinitely and announced his intention to transfer three days before Florida's national championship win over Oklahoma. All criminal charges against Newton were dropped after he completed a court-approved pretrial diversion program. Foxsports.com reported that Newton left the University of Florida after the fall semester in 2008 rather than face suspension or expulsion in part because of three instances of academic cheating.

In January 2009, Newton transferred to Blinn College a junior college in Brenham, Texas. In fall 2009, he was quarterback for the team. The team won the 2009 NJCAA National Football Championship. Newton then wanted to transfer to a four-year college, and his father allegedly sought money from the schools competing for Newton's attendance. Newton transferred to Auburn University where he also played quarterback.
Newton spent much of the second half of the 2010 football season haunted by allegations that his father, Cecil Newton, had sought substantial sums of money in return for his son playing for a major-college team. If true, this would violate National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules. In early November, officials with Mississippi State University charged that Cecil Newton said that it would take "more than just a scholarship" to secure his son's services. This demand was apparently communicated by Kenny Rogers, a recruiter who formerly played for the Bulldogs, to John Bond, his former teammate at MSU. Rogers later said in a Dallas radio interview that Cecil Newton said it would take "anywhere between $100,000 and $180,000" to get his son to transfer to MSU. Auburn maintained throughout the investigation that they were not involved in any pay-for-play scheme, and that Cam Newton was fully eligible to play.

On December 1, the NCAA announced that Auburn had declared Cam Newton to be ineligible. Auburn found evidence that Cecil Newton did in fact solicit Mississippi State for money in exchange for Cam Newton's athletic service. Auburn immediately asked the NCAA to reinstate Newton. The NCAA quickly reinstated Newton, declaring him eligible for the 2010 SEC Championship Game three days later. The NCAA said that there was not sufficient evidence that Cam Newton or anyone from Auburn had any knowledge of Cecil Newton's actions. Auburn subsequently limited the access Cecil Newton had to the football program as result of NCAA findings. Also due to increased pressure by the media and the NCAA investigation, Cecil Newton announced he would not attend the Heisman Trophy Ceremony. The NCAA reinstatement did not clear Cecil Newton of any wrongdoing. The NCAA action did make Cam Newton eligible to win the Heisman Trophy. He won the award with 2,263 points and 729 first-place votes.

In October 2011, the NCAA closed its 13 month investigation into the Auburn University recruitment of Newton. The NCAA conducted over 50 interviews, and reviewed bank records, IRS documents, telephone calls, and e-mail messages. The NCAA found nothing that would indicate Auburn participated in any pay-for-play scenario in recruiting Newton to become an Auburn student. The NCAA would say that the charges failed to "meet a burden of proof, which is a higher standard than rampant public speculation online and in the media". The NCAA's Stacey Osburn would say "We've done all we can do. We've done all the interviews. We've looked into everything, and there's nothing there. Unless something new comes to light that's credible and we need to look at, it's concluded." 

Newton was the first person to be selected in the 2011 NFL Draft. The Carolina Panthers picked him. No current Heisman Trophy winner had been the first draft pick since Carson Palmer in 2003. During the 2011 NFL lockout, he has spent up to 12 hours a day at the IMG Madden Football Academy in Bradenton, FL with up to two hours per day spent doing one-on-one training with fellow Heisman Trophy winner and Carolina Panther quarterback Chris Weinke.

On July 29, 2011, Newton signed a four-year deal worth over $22 million that is fully guaranteed. A month later on September 1, 2011, he was listed as the number one quarterback for the team, above Jimmy Clausen and Derek Anderson. In his NFL debut game on September 11, 2011, Newton was 24–37 passing for 422 yards, 2 touchdowns and 1 interception, in a 28–21 road loss to the Arizona Cardinals. With a quarterback rating of 110.4, he also rushed for a touchdown, and became the first rookie to throw for over 400 yards in his first career game. His 422 passing yards broke Peyton Manning's rookie record for most passing yards on opening day. 

In his second career game, his team lost 30–23 to the defending Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers. Newton broke his own record, set the weekend previously, with 432 yards passing, throwing and rushing for a touchdown. Newton's 854 passing yards in the first two games of the season was the most in league history by a rookie. Newton broke the NFL record of 827 set by Kurt Warner in the 2000 season and stood as the most by any quarterback in the first two weeks of the season until New England's Tom Brady broke the mark again later in the day with 940. He also became the only player to begin his career with consecutive 400-yard passing games He broke the Carolina Panthers franchise record of 547 yards previously held by Steve Beuerlein. After Newton's second career game, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers commented "I think someone said in the locker room that I'm kind of glad we played him early in the season because when he figures it out fully, he's going to be even tougher to stop." Newton's three additional interceptions against the Packers tied him for the most interceptions thrown in the league. He passed a total of 1,012 yards in the first three games. 

The Panthers recorded their first victory of the season against the Jacksonville Jaguars 16–10. Newton threw for 158 yards and one touchdown. The Panthers played the Atlanta Falcons, losing 31–17 while passing for 237 yards with no passing touchdowns. Newton's three interceptions returned him to leading the NFL in interceptions. On October 23, 2011, the Carolina Panthers won over the Washington Redskins, 33-20. Newton completed 18 of 23 passes for 256 yards and a touchdown. Newton also ran for 59 yards and a touchdown.

Anna Louise Strong

Anna Louise Strong (November 24, 1885 – March 29, 1970) was an American journalist and activist who reported on communist movements in the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. She also supported these movements.

Strong was born on November 24, 1885 in Friend, Nebraska. Her father, Sydney Dix Strong, was a minister in the Congregational Church and was a missionary. She was a very smart child and went through school very fast. She then went to Europe to study other languages.

She first attended Pennsylvania's Bryn Mawr College from 1903 to 1904, then graduated from Oberlin College in Ohio, where she later returned to speak many times. In 1908, at the age of 23, she finished her education and received a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Chicago with a thesis later published as "The Social Psychology of Prayer". She supported child welfare, and traveled around speaking about it. When she came toSeattle to speak about it in May 1914, more than 6,000 people came per day. At least 40,000 people came on her last day in Seattle. 

Strong was 30 years old when she returned to Seattle to live with her father, then pastor of Queen Anne Congregational Church. She liked the the progressive politics that were popular there, which supported organized labor. 

Strong also enjoyed mountain climbing. She organized cooperative summer camps in the Cascades and led climbing groups up Mt. Rainier.

When Strong ran for the Seattle School Board in 1916, she won easily because she was helped by women's groups and organized labor and because she was known as an expert on child welfare. She was the only female board member. She argued that the public schools should offer social service programs for poor children and that these programs should be community centers. But there was little she could do: Other members chose to devote meetings to things that Strong felt were less important, such as plumbing in the schools. 

In the year of her election, 1916, the Everett Massacre happened . Strong was hired as a stringer by the "New York Evening Post" to report on the bloody conflict between the IWW (or "Wobblies") and the army of armed guards hired by Everett mill owners to keep them out of town. At first, she was just somebody who was watching without taking a side. However, she soon started taking the side of workers' rights and speaking about this belief. 

Strong's endorsement of left-wing causes made her different from the other people on the school board. She was against war, and when the United States entered World War I in 1917, she spoke out against the draft. On one hand, the PTA and women's clubs joined her in opposing military training in the schools. On the other hand, the Seattle Minute Men, many of whom were veterans of the Spanish-American War, said that she was unpatriotic. 

The anti-war beliefs of the Wobblies led to many of them being arrested at the Seattle office where Louise Olivereau, a typist, was mailing things to draftees that told them to think about becoming conscientious objectors and not enter the draft. In 1918, Strong stood by Olivereau's side in the courtroom, as the typist-activist was tried for sedition, found guilty, and sent to prison. 

Strong's fellow school board members started recall campaign to get Strong removed from the school board, and they won. She showed up at their next meeting to argue that they should choose a woman to replace her. The school board decided to do this, but they said that they wanted a mainstream, patriotic representative, and a mother with children in the schools. They replaced Anna Louise Strong with Evangeline C. Harper, a well known country club woman.

Strong because known as part of the city's labor-owned daily newspaper, "The Union Record", writing forceful pro-labor articles and saying good things about the new Soviet government. On February 6, 1919, two days before the beginning of the Seattle General Strike of 1919, she wrote in an editorial: "We are undertaking the most tremendous move ever made by labor in this country, a move which will lead — NO ONE KNOWS WHERE!" The strike shut down the city for four days and then ended as it had begun — peacefully and with its goals still unclear.

Not knowing what to do, she took her friend Lincoln Steffens' advice and in 1921 travelled to Poland and Russia serving as a correspondent for the American Friends Service Committee. The reason she was going was to give the first foreign relief to the Volga famine victims. After a year of that, she was named Moscow correspondent for the International News Service. Strong saw many things in Europe which inspired her to write. Some of her works include "The First Time in History" (preface by Leon Trotsky) (1924), and "Children of Revolution" (1925). After remaining in the area for several years, Strong grew to become an supporter of socialism in the newly formed Soviet Union. In 1925, during the era of the New Economic Policy in the USSR, she came back to the United States to make businessmen interested in investing in industry and development in the Soviet Union. During this time Strong, also gave many speeches and became well known as an authority on "soft news" (such as how to get an apartment) about the USSR.

In the late 1920s, Strong travelled in China and other parts of Asia. She became friends with Soong Ching-ling and Zhou Enlai. She wrote some more books about her travels, including "China's Millions" (1928), "Red Star in Samarkand" (1929). 

In 1930 she came back to Moscow and helped start "Moscow News", the first English-language newspaper in the city. She was managing editor for a year and then became a featured writer. She married Soviet official and fellow socialist Joel Shubin in 1932. Much like Strong, Shubin was a man passionately dedicated to his work and the two were often apart because of work, and would ultimately spend little time together before Shubin's death in 1942.

While living in the Soviet Union, she became more happy with the Soviet government and wrote many books praising it. They include: "The Soviets Conquer Wheat" (1931), an updated version of "China's Millions: The Revolutionary Struggles from 1927 to 1935" (1935), the best-selling autobiographical "I Change Worlds: the Remaking of an American" (1935), "This Soviet World" (1936), and "The Soviet Constitution" (1937). 

In 1936 she returned once again to the United States. Quietly and privately upset with news in the USSR (The "Great Purges"), she continued to write for leading periodicals, including "The Atlantic Monthly", "Harper's", "The Nation" and "Asia". A visit to Spain resulted in "Spain in Arms" (1937); visits to China led to "One Fifth of Mankind" (1938). In 1940 she published "My Native Land". Other books include "The Soviets Expected It" (1941); the novel "Wild River" (1943), set in Russia; "Peoples of the U.S.S.R." (1944), "I Saw the New Poland" (1946) (based on her reporting from Poland as she accompanied the occupying Red Army); and three books on the success of the early Communist Party of China in the Chinese Civil War. 

While in the USSR she travelled throughout the huge nation, including the Ukraine, Kuznetsk, Stalingrad, Kiev, Siberia, Central Asia, Uzbekistan, and many more. She also travelled into Poland, Germany, and Britain. While in the Soviet Union, Strong met with Stalin, Molotov, and many other Soviet officials. She interviewed factory workers, farmers, and pedestrians. 

In World War II, when the Red Army began its advance against Nazi Germany, Strong stayed in the rear following the soldiers through Warsaw, Łódź and Gdańsk. In great part because of her overtly pro-Chinese Communist sympathies she was arrested in Moscow in 1949 and charged by the Soviets with espionage. She later returned to the USSR in 1959, but settled in China until her death. 

Strong met W. E. B. Du Bois, who visited Communist China during the Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s. Neither ever supported famine-related criticisms of the Great Leap. Strong wrote a book titled "When Serfs Stood Up in Tibet" based on her experience during this period, which include the Chinese invasion of Tibet. 

Partly from fear of losing her passport if she came back to the USA, she moved to China until her death in 1970, publishing a "Letter from China." During that time, she got to know Zhou Enlai very well, and also knew Mao Zedong. She lived in the old Italian Legation which had been changed into flats for the leading "foreign friends".

Anna Louise Strong died in Beijing, on March 29, 1970.

Ingredient

An ingredient is a part that forms part of a mixture (in a general sense). For example, in cooking, recipes specify which ingredients are used to prepare a specific dish. Many commercial products contain a secret ingredient that is purported to make them better than competing products. In the health industry, an active ingredient is that part of a recipe that yields the effect required by the buyer.

National laws usually require prepared food products to show a list of ingredients, and require that certain "bad things" be listed.

In most developed countries, the law requires that ingredients be listed according to their weight in the product. If an ingredient itself consists of more than one ingredient (such as the cookie pieces which are a part of "cookies and cream" flavor ice cream), then that ingredient is listed by what percentage of the total product it occupies, with its own ingredients showed next to it in brackets.

Special chainsaws are used for cutting concrete.

A chainsaw has several parts, including:


As chainsaw carving has become more popular, the makers of chansaws are making special short, narrow-tipped bars for carving. These are called "quarter tipped," "nickel tipped" or "dime tipped" bars, based on the size of the round tip.

Orion (spacecraft)

Orion is a spacecraft which is being drawn by Lockheed Martin for NASA. Each Orion spacecraft is going to carry four astronauts. The spacecraft was first drawn out to be launched by the Ares I launch vehicle, for the Constellation Program. On 11 October 2010, with the ending of the Constellation Program the Orion vehicle is now thought to be launched on top of a Heavy Lift Vehicle.

Orion would launch from Launch Complex 39 at Kennedy Space Center, the same launch site used by the Space Shuttle and the Saturn V.[3] While shuttle operations continued from launch pad 39A, 39B was readied for Ares launches. The first crewed Orion flight is set for 2016. Next flights would visit the International Space Station. If commercial space transportation services are not used, Orion would handle building flights to the station. After that, Orion may become a key part of human missions beyond low Earth orbit which may include missions to Near-Earth objects, the Moon and Mars.

The US government thought of ending the Constellation program in February 2010 and was put into law October 11. The law is remaking the Constellation program and putting more efffort into visiting Near-earth objects and Mars.

Theogony

The Theogony (Greek: Θεογονία, "Theogonía", the birth of the gods) is a poem by Hesiod. It was written in the 8th or 7th century BC, and uses the same dialect of Ancient Greek than Homer. This dialect is known as Epic dialect today. With the exception of the Illiad and the Odyssey, the Theogony is the oldest known source of Greek mythology. 

The poem is a synthesis of different Greek stories and traditions. It is a story that tells how the gods came to be and how they established permanent control over the cosmos. It is the first Greek mythical cosmogony. In the beginning, the state of the universe is chaos - a dark indefinite void. Everything else appeared from divine chaos.

The video opens with a nighttime street level shot in a city. As the camera pans down below the ground, Lambert is shown walking into an underground club, filled with scantily clad men and women. As he begins singing, he walks through the crowd and interacts and dances with others. Mixed with dancing are close up shots of Lambert and various dancers. Towards the end of the song, Lambert begins to play with his band and the video shows everyone in the club dancing. As the song ends, the camera pans back up to the street level where life is continuing on, completely oblivious of what is going on below the streets.

If I Had You (styled as If I Had U) is "Adam Lambert's" 3rd official mainstream single released of his debut album, "For Your Entertaintment". The song was written by Max Martin, Shellback, and Savan Kotecha for Lambert's debut album, For Your Entertainment. It was released as the third single on May 5, 2010.

James Montgomery from MTV describes the video as having "a clearing in the forest, one packed with party people — of all races, colors, creeds and proclivities, naturally — who are all in the midst of a totally excellent celebration. (Most of said party people are actually Lambert's friends, from his days performing with L.A.'s "Zodiac Show.")" Montgomery states the message of the video is "Humanity can, in fact, put their differences aside and just dance."

The video premiered June 14, 2010 on VH1 and "takes the late-night wilderness party motif of Jennifer Lopez's classic "Waiting for Tonight" clip and adds more lasers, guyliner, thrashy dance moves, silver top hats and outrageously spiky shoulder pads." Bryan Barber directed the video, which was inspired by Lambert's self-proclaimed "psychedelic" experience at Burning Man.

Remixes of the song include an instrumental remix and a radio edit. As well DJ's and producer's like Jason Nevins, Dangerous Muse, and Morgan Page.

2010-11 flood in the Philippines

Strong rain in some places in the Central part of Visayas and Eastern section of Luzon and Mindanao caused floods. By January 12, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) pegged those affected at 235,867 families or 1,230,022 people in 1,267 villages in 137 towns and 10 cities in 23 provinces.

The causes of flood was blamed by a stationary front or called tail-end of cold front and wind convergence.
PAGASA reported that the cold front will past at the places of Eastern Visayas and Central Visayas also the wind convergence

The first reports of flooding were at the Bicol Region provinces of Albay and Sorsogon. In late December, Albay governor Joey Salceda had placed his province under a state of emergancy after the rains caused the deaths of two people and the displacement of 4,000. He has also issued a mandatory evacuation on residents in affected areas. Fears of lahar flows from the recently active Mayon Volcano had been dismissed. In adjacent Sorsogon, 170 families had already been evacuated.

At the start of the new year, the cold front moved to the central part of the Philippines, stretching a rain band from Southern Leyte to Misamis Oriental. PAGASA forecast more rain until January 6 in these areas. At least five deaths have been confirmed in these areas: three children died after being buried by a landslide in Saint Bernard, Southern Leyte, while two others drowned in the same province. The town and five other municipalities in the province had also been without power. Several towns in Eastern Samar and Northern Samar have also reported flooding. Elsewhere, minor landslides were reported in Hinabangan, Samar and Tacloban. In Cebu City, a flight going to Siargao had been canceled, and landslides have also been reported.

More than 2,000 people have been displaced in the Caraga due to the rains. A landslide claimed a life of a person in Monkayo, Compostela Valley, while three girls were reported missing in the area.

On January 6, the cold front that affected Caraga and Eastern Visayas moved to Bicol and brought rains anew. This caused the evacuation of 8,200 people in the region.

By January 6, Butuan, Agusan del Sur towns of Bunawan and San Francisco, and Surigao del Sur were placed under state of calamity as additional seven deaths were recorded. Flood damage to government infrastructure in Caraga was at 141 million Philippine pesos (US$3.2 million).

More than 80% of the evacuees in Albay were sent home after conditions improved on January 7. Classes that were suspended on January 6 reopened the next day except for schools that were used as evacuation centers. Meanwhile, the floods subsided in Davao del Norte and Compostela Valley, but it destroyed the crops of some 2,100 farmers. The NDRRMC pegged the damages to agriculture and infrastructure nationwide at 183 million pesos (US$4.1 million).

As of January 23, 2010 the death toll from the floods has risen to 68 with 26 others still missing.
Another causes of flooding was the Wind Convergence.On January 26 heavy rain bought by the northeast monsoon fall down Cebu.

Salceda urged PAGASA to assign names to weather systems that are not storms that cause disruptions. Secretary of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Rogelio Singson also said in a DWIZ interview that PAGASA "should draw up a classification system, not just for typhoons but also for massive rainfall." PAGASA for their part had already installed automatic weather stations, and established a community-based early warning system.

The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), which had been in a decades-long insurgency, instructed its military arm the New People's Army to help in relief operations. The government and the CCP ended their ceasefire on January 3.

Kenneth Wregget (born March 25, 1964) is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender. He won the Stanley Cup in 1992 with the Pittsburgh Penguins. 

He played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins, Calgary Flames, and Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League from 1983 through 2000. He played one season for the Manitoba Moose of the International Hockey League in 2000–2001 before retiring at the age of 37.

Wregget played for three seasons with the Lethbridge Broncos of the Western Hockey League and won the Del Wilson Trophy as the WHL's top goaltender in 1984. In 1983, he joined the St. Catharines Saints, the Toronto AHL affiliate, after being drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the third round of the 1982 NHL Entry Draft, 45th overall. He split time for two seasons between St. Catharines and the Maple Leafs. The 1986–87 season was his first full year in the NHL.

In 1992, he was traded from the Philadelphia Flyers to the reigning champion Pittsburgh Penguins along with Kjell Samuelsson and Rick Tocchet in exchange for Mark Recchi. Wregget was generally backup to Penguins goaltender Tom Barrasso, although Wregget was regarded as a solid goaltender in his own right. There was frequent speculation that Wregget would take over as the starting goaltender.

Wregget's best season came in 1994–95 when he played in 38 games and compiled a 25–9-2 record with a 3.21 goals against average and a .903 save percentage while also leading the NHL in wins. He was also the goaltender who faced the first penalty shot ever awarded during an overtime period in NHL playoff history (1996). He stopped Washington Capitals star Joé Juneau, extending what was the third-longest game in NHL history, the longest game since 1936. The Penguins finally won 3–2 in the fourth overtime period.

In 2009, he was inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame.

Isles of Scilly

The Isles of Scilly form an archipelago off the southwestern tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. 

The islands have had a unitary authority council since 1890, and are separate from the Cornwall unitary authority. Some services are combined with Cornwall and the islands are still part of the ceremonial county of Cornwall.

The islands are designated an 'Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty'. They have been dangerous for ships, and there are 530 known shipwrecks around the archipelago.

Scilly has been inhabited since the Neolithic. Its history has been one of subsistence living until the early 20th century (people lived from what they could get from the land or the sea). Farming and fishing continue today, but the main industry now is tourism.

It is likely that until relatively recent times the Isles were much larger with many of them joined into one island, named Ennor. Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400–500 AD, forming the current islands.

Evidence for the older large island includes:

Offshore, midway between Land's End and the Isles of Scilly, is the supposed location of the mythical lost land of Lyonesse, referred to in Arthurian literature.

Scilly has been identified as the place of exile of two heretical 4th century bishops, Instantius and Tiberianus, who were followers of Priscillian.

The Isles of Scilly form an archipelago of five populated islands and many other small rocky islets (around 140 in total) lying 45 km (28 mi) off Land's End. They are all composed of granite of early Permian age.

The position of the islands causes great contrasts. The warming effect of the sea means they rarely have frost or snow. This allows local farmers to grow flowers earlier than would grow on mainland Britain. The chief agricultural product is cut flowers, mostly daffodils. 

Exposure to Atlantic winds means that spectacular winter gales lash the islands from time to time. This is reflected in the landscape. On Tresco, the lush sub-tropical Tresco Abbey Gardens shelter on the southern end of the island, but the low heather and bare rock get the wind on the exposed northern end.

<doc id="280405" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=280405" title="Calluna">
Calluna

Calluna vulgaris (known as Common Heather, or simply heather) is the sole species in the genus Calluna in the family Ericaceae. 

It is a low-growing perennial shrub growing to tall, or rarely to . It is found widely in Europe and Asia Minor on acidic soils in open sunny situations and in moderate shade. 

Heather is the dominant plant on most heaths and moorland in Europe, and in some bog vegetation and acidic pine and oak woodland. It is tolerant of grazing and regenerates following occasional burning. It is often managed in nature reserves and grouse moors by sheep or cattle grazing, and also by light burning.

The flowers emerge in late summer; in wild plants these are normally mauve, but white-flowered plants also occur occasionally.

Heather is an important food source for various sheep and deer which can graze the tips of the plants when snow covers low growing vegetation. Willow Grouse and Red Grouse feed on the young shoots and seeds of this plant. Both adults and larvae of the Heather Beetle "Lochmaea suturalis" feed on it, and can cause damage. The larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species also feed on the plant.

Heather honey is a highly valued product in moorland and heathland areas, with many beehives being moved there in late summer. It has a strong taste, and an unusual texture. It is thixotropic, being a jelly until stirred, when it becomes a syrup (like other honey), but then sets again to a jelly. This makes the extraction of the honey from the comb difficult, and it is therefore often sold as comb honey.

Heather is seen as iconic of Scotland, where the plant grows widely. When poems like "Bonnie Auld Scotland" speak of "fragrant hills of purple heather', when the hero of "Kidnapped" flees through the heather, when heather and Scotland are linked in the same sentence, the heather talked about is "Calluna vulgaris".

Dozois is well-known for publishing books that collect many short stories. After leaving "Asimov's", he continued as the editor of the series "The Year's Best Science Fiction". This has been published each year since 1984. He has also edited a long series of themed anthologies with Jack Dann. Each book has a title that explains the theme, such as "Cats", "Dinosaurs", "Seaserpents", or "Hackers".

Dozois has always said he was especially interested in adventure SF and space opera. He calls these two sub-genre "center-core SF".

Michael Swanwick published a book-length interview with Dozois in 2001. The book was called "Being Gardner Dozois" and was about each published piece of fiction Dozois ever wrote. Swanwick had written some stories together with Dozois. In 2002, the interview was named as a possible Hugo Award for Best Related Book winner. It won the 2002 Locus Award for Non-Fiction.

Highland Boundary Fault

The Highland Boundary Fault is a geological fault that traverses Scotland from Arran and Helensburgh on the west coast to Stonehaven in the east. It separates two distinctly different regions: the Highlands from the Lowlands.

The geological history of Scotland can be understood as the result of two great tectonic events. The first was the formation of the global super-continent Pangaea, the second was the break-up of Pangaea to form the continents we know today.

The fault is the middle of three great faults which run south-east to north-west across Scotland. In the north there is the Great Glen Fault, and in the south the Southern Uplands Fault. Further south, just over the border with England, is the Iapetus Suture, where the palaeo-Iapetus Ocean closed. These four major geological signs mark the ancient history of Scotland.

The Highland Boundary Fault was active during the Caledonian Orogeny. This was a plate tectonic collision which took place from Mid Ordovician to Mid Devonian periods (520 to 400 million years ago), during the closure of the Iapetus Ocean. 

The fault allowed the Midland Valley to descend as a major rift by up to 4000 metres and there was subsequently vertical movement. This movement was later replaced by a horizontal shear. A complementary fault, the Southern Uplands Fault, forms the southern boundary for the Central Lowlands.

2011 Egyptian revolution

The 2011 Egyptian revolution also known as The Day of Anger and The Day of Revolt, is a series of demonstrations and riots in Egypt that started on 25 January 2011. 

The demonstrations and riots began in the weeks after the successful uprising in Tunisia. The people who organised the Egyptian protest are hoping that the events in Tunisia would inspire the crowds to mobilise. The protests are taking place in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Ismailiya. In the first day of the protests the Egyptian government censored most of the media outlets inside Egypt and had taken measures to block most social media websites which helped the protesters spread news about the events. On the eve of January 28, a nationwide internet and mobile phone "blackout" began, though before dawn of the following morning it was reported that the blackout for cell phones had ended.

So far there have been over 1,000 arrests, at least 1,030 protestors were injured and at least 53 deaths have been reported.

The people are demonstrating because they want specific issues solved. These include police brutality, state of emergency laws, lack of free elections, corruption, restrictions on freedom of speech, high unemployment, low minimum wages, insufficient housing, food price inflation, and poor living conditions.

Mohamed ElBaradei said that a possible objective could be to force Hosni Mubarak to quit. ElBaradei is seens as a likely candidate for a new government. 

Localised protests have been commonplace in previous years. Major protests and riots broke all over the country starting on 25 January, known as the "Day of Anger"; this date was selected by Egyptian opposition groups and others for a major demonstration. The 2011 protests have been called "unprecedented" for Egypt, and "the largest display of popular dissatisfaction in recent memory". The events have been the largest demonstrations seen in Egypt since the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots. Egyptians from different social and economic backgrounds and faiths have joined in protest together for the first time. 

The capitol city of Cairo has been described as "a war zone", and the port city of Suez has been the scene of frequent violent clashes. The Egyptian government has attempted to break up and contain protests using different methods. Anti-riot police groups have been responding to areas with shields, rubber bullets, batons, water cannons, tear gas and, in some cases, live ammunition. For the most part, the protest response has been non-lethal, but there have been fatalities. The government successfully turned off internet access and imposed a curfew,‎ claiming that minimizing disruption from the protests is necessary to maintain order and to prevent an uprising of fundamentalist Islamic groups.

The protests have captured worldwide attention due to the increasing integration of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and other social media platforms that have allowed activists and onlookers to communicate, coordinate, and document the events as they occur. As the level of publicity has increased, the Egyptian government has made increasing efforts to limit internet access, especially to social media. On the evening of major planned protests on Friday 28 January, a nationwide internet and mobile phone "blackout" began, though before dawn the following morning it was reported that the blackout for cell phones had ended.

On February 11, Mubarak resigned from office due to a result of determined protests and pressure.

<doc id="280467" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=280467" title="Scottish Highlands">
Scottish Highlands

The Scottish Highlands is an historic region of Scotland. It is the area to the north of the Highland Boundary Fault. The fault separates the hard igneous and metamorphic rocks to the north from the softer sedimentary rocks of the Scottish Lowlands in the south. 

The Highlands are divided in two parts. The Great Glen divides the Grampian Mountains to the southeast from the Northwest Highlands. 

The area is generally sparsely populated, with many mountain ranges, and includes the highest mountain in the British Isles, Ben Nevis. 

Before the 19th century the Highlands was home to a much larger population but, for several reasons, the area is now one of the most sparsely populated in Europe. The average population density in the Highlands and Islands is lower than that of Sweden, Norway, Papua New Guinea and Argentina.

The reasons for the low population include the harsh nature of the land. Also, the outlawing of the traditional Highland way of life after the Jacobite Rising of 1745, the infamous Highland Clearances, and mass migration to urban areas during the Industrial Revolution all had their effects.

Like the Scottish islands, the Highlands are a stronghold of Protestant churches. There is the Kirk (the national Presbyterian Church of Scotland), but the Wee Frees (Free Church of Scotland, several versions) are the typical religion of the Highlands and Islands. Old-style observance of the Sabbath is typical of these areas.

Francis Richard "Dick" Scobee (May 19, 1939 - January 28, 1986) was an American astronaut who was the lieutenant colonel of Space Shuttle Challenger when it blew up and killed him and six other crew members. 

Scobee was selected for NASA's astronaut program in January 1978 and he completed his training in August 1979. In April 1984, Scobee piloted the Challenger mission STS-41-C, which successfully deployed one satellite and repaired another. 

He was elevated to the role of spacecraft commander for the STS-51-L mission (challenger mission) and the mission was designed to deploy a satellite to study the approaching Halley's Comet and to inaugurate the Teacher in Space Project which was delayed several times due to bad weather and technical glitches. When they did the mission, an O-ring seal failure destroyed the shuttle 73 seconds into the flight, killing Scobee and the other six members of the crew; the tragedy was viewed live on national television and prompted several days of national mourning.

Scobee is survived by his wife Virginia June Kent, and two children, Kathie R. (Scobee) Fulgham and Brigadier General Richard W. Scobee, USAF.

<doc id="280486" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=280486" title="Scottish Lowlands">
Scottish Lowlands

The Scottish Lowlands is the part of Scotland not referred to as the Highlands.

That is everywhere south and east of the Highland Boundary Fault, between Stonehaven and Helensburgh (on the Firth of Clyde). 

Geographically, Scotland Lowlands are divided into two distinct areas: the Central Lowlands, and the Southern Uplands. 

The southernmost counties of Scotland, nearest the border with England, are also known as the Borders. 

The Central Lowlands or Midland Valley is a geologically defined area of relatively low-lying land in southern Scotland. It consists of a rift valley between the Highland Boundary Fault to the north and the Southern Uplands Fault to the south. The Central Lowlands are one of the three main geographical sub-divisions of Scotland, the other two being the Highlands and Islands which lie to the north and west and the Southern Uplands, which lie south of the second fault line.

The Midland Valley has fertile low-lying agricultural land and significant deposits of valuable coal and iron have led to the Central Lowlands being much more densely populated than the rest of Scotland. 

The major cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Stirling and Dundee all lie in the Central Lowlands, and over half of Scotland's population lives in this region.

The Southern Uplands is the southernmost and least populous of mainland Scotland's three major geographic areas. They lie south of the Southern Uplands Fault line that runs from Ballantrae on the Ayrshire coast northeastwards to Dunbar in East Lothian on the North Sea coast, a distance of some . The term is used both to describe the geographical region and to collectively denote the various ranges of hills within this region.

The Southern Uplands Fault in Scotland is a fault that runs from Girvan (or more specifically from the Rhins of Galloway) to Dunbar on the East coast. It marks the southern boundary of the Scottish Midland Valley.

Grampian Mountains

The Grampian Mountains or Grampians are one of the three major mountain ranges in Scotland, occupying a considerable portion of the Scottish Highlands in northeast Scotland. They occupy almost half the land-area of Scotland.

The Grampians extend southwest to northeast between the Highland Boundary Fault and "Gleann Mòr" (the Great Glen). This includes the Cairngorms and the Lochaber hills. The range includes Ben Nevis (the highest point in the British Isles at 1,344 metres above sea level) and Ben Macdui (the second highest at 1,309 metres).

The mountains are composed of granite, gneiss, marble, schists and quartzite. The other major mountain ranges in Scotland are the Northwest Highlands and the Southern Uplands.

A number of rivers and streams rise in the Grampians: the Tay, Spey, Cowie Water, Burn of Muchalls, Burn of Pheppie, Burn of Elsick, Cairnie Burn, Don, Dee and Esk. The area is generally sparsely populated.

<doc id="280493" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=280493" title="Northwest Highlands">
Northwest Highlands

The Northwest Highlands are the northern third of Scotland that is separated from the Grampian Mountains by the Great Glen. The Caledonian Canal, which extends from Loch Linnhe in the west, via Loch Ness to the Moray Firth in the north splits this area from the rest of the country.

The Highlands are formed on Lewisian gneiss, the oldest layers of rock in Scotland. There are impressive rock islands of dark red or gray Torridonian sandstone which project out of the gneiss. Some of the peaks, such as Beinn Eighe and Canisp, are topped with light gray or white Cambrian quartzite.

The city of Inverness, known as the "Capital of the Highlands", is by far the largest settlement in the region. It is the administrative centre for the Highland Council area.

This area's climate varies with altitude. It has wet, warm summers, average under 17C (62.6F). The winters are mild at low altitude but become snowier and colder with higher elevation. 

Mountains may have up to 6 months of snow. Naturally the area would be a vast birch, pine and montane shrub forest, such as those surviving in Glen Affric. Snow may lie from more than a month to 105 days, but not at coastal or very low altitudes.

The region has steep, glacier-carved mountains, valleys and interspersed plains. Many islands (which also vary widely) lie off the coast. 

Elevations of around 800 metres or over are common, as are mountains exceeding 1000 metres. 

The Northwest Highlands are typically not quite as cold as the Cairngorms. Considering its terrain and its latitude of about 57 to 58 degrees North, the area is surprisingly warm: this is due to the mild influence of the Gulf Stream. The aurora borealis is sometimes visible on winter nights, weather permitting, especially at the climax of the 11 year cycle.

Bordering the region to the north east is the lowland area of Caithness.

The region has a very low population density. Significant settlements are Kyle of Lochalsh, Mallaig, Dingwall, Dornoch, and Ullapool.

Geologically, the Northwest Highlands exteds to the Hebrides, especially Lewis and Harris.

The main outcrops of the Lewisian complex are on the islands of the Outer Hebrides, including Lewis, from which the complex takes its name. It is also exposed on several islands of the Inner Hebrides, small islands north of the Scottish mainland and forms a coastal strip on the mainland. 

The Lewisian complex or Lewisian Gneiss is a suite of Precambrian metamorphic rocks that outcrop in the northwestern part of Scotland, forming part of the Hebridean Terrane. These rocks are of Archaean and Paleoproterozoic age, ranging from 3.0–1.7 billion years ago. 

They form the basement on which later sediments were deposited. The Lewisian consists mainly of granitic gneisses. Rocks of the Lewisian complex were caught up in the Caledonian orogeny, appearing in the hanging walls of many of the thrust faults formed during the late stages of this tectonic event.

Its presence at the seabed and beneath Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata west of Shetland has been confirmed by shallow boreholes and hydrocarbon exploration wells. 

Basement rocks of similar type are found at the base of the Moine Supergroup, sometimes with well-preserved unconformable contacts. These form part of the Lewisian, so the Lewisian complex extends at least as far southeast as the Great Glen Fault.
