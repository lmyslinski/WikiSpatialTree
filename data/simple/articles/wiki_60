Cali

Cali (official name, Santiago de Cali) is the capital of Valle del Cauca department in Colombia and the third most populated city in the country, after Bogotá and Medellín. Like other department capitals, it is home of the Valle del Cauca Governance, Departmental assembly, The Court of Justice, and other official institutions.

Santiago de Cali was founded in 1536 and although is one of the oldest cities in America, only until the 1930's accelerated its development to become a one of the major economic and industrial centers of the country and the main urban center, cultural, economic, industrial and agriculture of southwestern of Colombia.

The city has a compound name in the fashion of almost all Spanish settlements in America. Santiago (one of the most popular names on the continent thanks to the devotion of Santiago de Compostela in Spain), lives up to the Apostle Santiago. Cali was founded 25 July, the day which marks the date of the Apostle Santiago, principal patron of Europe. So given this name to the city. Cali, derived from the word of the Páez language, "Caly" (Knitting). Like many others placements of the department. Ej: "Buga" (Large clay pot), "Yumbo" (Flood, river bank, large river.), "Sonso" (Frog), "Dagua" (A type of tree), "Petecué" (Macaw), "Tulua" (Orchad), "Chipichape" (Cooked corn kernels), "Yotoco" (fans the flame), "Quilichao" (Flame sheds), "Changos" (Chisel).

Santiago de Cali is one of the oldest cities in Colombia, and the Americas. Its foundation dates back to 1536 by the conquistador Sebastian de Belalcazar (one of the indigenous genocide of the time), to just three years after the foundation of Cartagena de Indias (1533), two years before the foundation of Santa Fe de Bogotá (1538) and 26 years of the founding of the first Hispanic population on the continent: Santa María la Antigua del Darién ( 1510), missing.

The city is located at coordinates ((coord | 3 | 27 | 00 | N | 76 | 32 | 00 | W)), in the department of Valle del Cauca. Geographically Cali is in the valley of the Cauca River, the second largest in the country. At the height of Cali this valley is 35 km wide and the urban area is on the west side of river. The western part of the city is guarded by the famous Farallones de Cali, which are part of the Cordillera Occidental of the Colombian Andes.

The municipality of Cali bordered to the north with Yumbo and La Cumbre, in the northeast by Palmira and east to Candelaria. To the south is the municipality of Jamundí, rural areas of Buenaventura in the southwest, and Dagua to the northwest.

The city is flat with an average elevation of 1,000 m. Cali is situated besides a focal and strategic point: to the west (approximately 100 km) is connected with the port of Buenaventura on the Pacific coast, and northeastern industrial center that conforms to Yumbo the Metropolitan Area of Cali. The city is a step in addition to the Pan-American Highway and therefore a must from Colombia to the Ecuador.

The main river of the city and the department is the Cauca River, the part of the municipality comes from the mouth of the river Jamundí to the border between Cali and Yumbo. The Cauca is a sinuous on his way through the department of Valle, 40 miles sailed in the municipality, advanced only 26 km south-north after multiple meanders.

The climate is tropical savanna. The Western Cordillera blocks of moist air fronts from the Pacific Ocean although it is notable that the sea breeze comes to town. The Western Cordillera has 2,000 m average altitude in the north of the city and reached the 4,000 m in the south, this makes in the city the southwestern region that is more rainy than Northwest. The average annual precipitation ranges from 900 mm in the drier areas to 1,800 mm in wetter areas, with 1,000 mm average over most of the metropolitan area of Cali. The average temperature is 26 ° C (79 ° F) with a minimum average of 19 ° C (66 ° F) and a maximum average of 34 ° C (93 ° F). Dry seasons are December to March and July to August and the rainy season from April to June.

The location in the Cauca Valley, the climate and terrain, make the city an area of great natural wealth. The confluence of rivers and other water sources make the region a natural output of crops such as sugar cane and animal breeding.

As for minerals, although Valle del Cauca is not a metal region, in the city of Cali there are several coal mines in formations called Guachinte and Ferreira, located in the south and north of the urban area. In the northern part of the urban area, extending to Yumbo is open pit mining for construction materials.

Cali have a great number's of Universities and Knowledge Centers, that make the city one of the principal centers of education in the country.

The principal university in cali, is the Universidad del Valle (Univalle), University of Valley, Public institution founded in 1945, serves a demand of 29 000 students in undergraduate and graduate (8000 in the regional headquarters), at the headquarters of Cali, 20 800 are undergraduates and 2380 graduate and doctoral programs. It is the leading research and academic center of southwestern Colombia. It has the largest library in the region with 628 569 copies (307 514 books). is among the best national universities and South America.

Other's Universities in the City:
Icesi University, Pontifical Javeriana University, Autonomy University of Western, Saint Buenaventura University, Santiago de Cali University, and many others technical and technological institutes.

Good Morning Good Morning

"Good Morning Good Morning" is a song written by John Lennon (credited to Lennon/McCartney) and performed by The Beatles on the 1967 "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" album.

Inspiration for the song came to Lennon from a television commercial for Kellogg's Corn Flakes. The jingle went: "Good morning, good morning, The best to you each morning, Sunshine Breakfast, Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Crisp and full of fun".

The line ""It's time for tea and Meet the Wife"" refers to a BBC sitcom, "Meet the Wife".

The track was recorded on 8 February 1967, with overdubs (extra music that's recorded into the song) on 16 February (bass and vocals), 13 March (brass section), 28 March (backing vocals and guitar solo), and 29 March (animal noises). The guitar solo was played by Paul McCartney.

At Lennon's request, George Martin brought in Sounds Incorporated to play the brass section with their signature saxophone sound.

Lennon asked engineer Geoff Emerick to arrange the animal noises heard at beginning as well as the end of the song so that the animal heard was one capable of devouring or frightening the animal that came before it..

The final sound effect of a chicken clucking was so placed that it transforms into the guitar on the following track, "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)".

In the mono version, the length is 2:35, whereas in the stereo version, the length is 2:41 because there are more animal noises.

A Day in the Life

"A Day in the Life" is a song by the English rock group The Beatles, the last song on the group's 1967 album "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". It is a very famous song.

Many people think that the first verse was written about the death of Tara Browne, the 21-year-old heir to the Guinness fortune and close friend of Lennon and McCartney, who had crashed his Lotus Elan on 18 December 1966 when a Volkswagen pulled out of a side street into his path in Redcliffe Gardens, Earls Court. In many interviews, Lennon said this was the verse's main inspiration. However, George Martin thinks that it is a drug reference (as is the line "I'd love to turn you on" and other passages from the song) and while writing the lyrics Lennon and McCartney were imagining a stoned politician who had stopped at a set of traffic lights.

The description of the accident in "A Day in the Life" was not a literal description of Browne's fatal accident. Lennon said, "I didn't copy the accident. Tara didn't blow his mind out, but it was in my mind when I was writing that verse. The details of the accident in the song — not noticing traffic lights and a crowd forming at the scene — were similarly part of the fiction."

The final verse was inspired by an article in the "Daily Mail" in January 1967 regarding a substantial number of potholes in Blackburn, a town in Lancashire. However, he had a problem with the words of the final verse, not being able to think of how to connect "Now they know how many holes it takes to" and "the Albert Hall". His friend Terry Doran suggested that they would "fill" the Albert Hall.

"A Day in the Life" is in the key of G major, but, as Alan W. Pollack explains, "its true center of gravity is in the parallel minor and Major keys of E." The verses are in G-major/E-minor and the bridge is in E-major. A 4/4 meter is used throughout.
The song is laid out with an instrumental beginning, followed by three verses (0:13), an orchestral crescendo (1:45), a middle section (2:16), an orchestral bridge (2:49), the final verse (3:19), a second orchestral climax (3:50), and a final piano chord (4:21–5:05).

Each verse sung by Lennon follows the same basic layout, but each has a different way of ending. The first verse, which is twenty measures, ends with a repetition of the F major chord progression before returning to the home key. The second verse, two measures shorter than the first, ends on the C major chord rather than repeating the F major progression. The third verse is the same as the second, except that there is one more measure (to accommodate the "I'd love to"), and the verse does not return to the home key. Instead it leads to a bridge, a long climax starting from low E to an E several octaves higher. Random cymbal crashes are interspersed near the end to "challenge your sense of meter".

An alarm clock rings, beginning McCartney's verse. While the pulse of this section remains the same, the accents suggest a tempo twice as fast as that of the verses before. The three chords in this nineteen measures long section are the I, flat VII, and V chords (E, D, and B). This is followed by an orchestral bridge: a repeated circle of fifths (from C to E) over twenty measures. The bridge is accompanied by a wordless vocal ("Ahhhh...") and leads to the fourth and final verse.

The final verse has the same layout as the third verse. Starr's drumming, however, retains its double-time feel from McCartney's section. This verse leads to the second crescendo. However, after the orchestra hits its highest note, there is a measure of silence, which leads to the final E-major piano chord.

Following the final orchestral climax, the song ends with one of the most famous final chords in music history. Lennon, McCartney, Starr, and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on the Harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The final chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.

The piano chord was a replacement for a failed vocal experiment: on the evening following the orchestra recording session, the four Beatles had recorded an ending of their voices humming the chord, but after multiple overdubs they wanted something with more impact.

McCartney provided the fourth verse of the song, a short piano piece he had been working on by himself, with lyrics about a commuter whose uneventful morning routine leads him to drift off into a dream. He had written the piece as a wistful recollection of his younger years, which included riding the bus to school, smoking, and going to class. The line "I'd love to turn you on", which concludes both verse sections, was, according to Lennon, also contributed by McCartney; Lennon said "I had the bulk of the song and the words, but he contributed this little lick floating around in his head that he couldn't use for anything."

2007 Formula One espionage controversy

The 2007 Formula One espionage controversy, also known as "Spygate," or "Stepneygate" involves claim that the teams passed confidential technical information. It was claimed that McLaren Formula One had information from the Ferrari team. Then it was claimed that Renault F1 had information from the McLaren team.

The case involved Nigel Stepney, who used to work for Ferrari and was working at the time for McLaren. It also included Mike Coughlan, who was working for McLaren and his wife Trudy Coughlan. Ferrari claimed that Stepney stole confidential technical information. This became the subject of legal action in Italy and an FIA investigation. The case in England was dropped after Ferrari reached an agreement with the Coughlans.

The FIA penalized McLaren. The biggest penalty was that McLaren excluded (not allowed to compete) from the Constructors' Championship. They were also fined a record-breaking $100 million (USD).

Then the FIA claimed Renault F1 had information about the 2006 and 2007 McLaren cars. Renault were found guilty of breaking the same regulation as McLaren, but Renault was not punished.

Nigel Stepney was working at Ferrari with Jean Todt, Ross Brawn and Rory Byrne. Michael Schumacher was their superstar driver. They were part of the team given the credit for changing the of fortunes of Ferrari in the late 1990s. 

In February 2007, Stepney said he was unhappy with some management changes made at Ferrari. On 3 July 2007, "Gazzetta dello Sport" reported that Ferrari had fired Stepney as a result an internal investigation. 

The same day Ferrari fired Stepney, they announced taking action against an engineer from McLaren, later named as Mike Coughlan. Coughlan was suspended by McLaren as a result. Court details released say that Mike Coughlan is accused to be in possession of Ferrari documentation, and that his wife is accused of photocopying them.

On 8 November 2007, the FIA announced that the Renault F1 team would be need to answer a charge of possession of confidential information relating to the 2006 and 2007 McLaren Formula One cars. The statement issued by the FIA states that Renault F1 was found to have information used by the 2006 and 2007 McLaren F1 cars. 

On 6 July 2007, Honda Racing F1 released a statement confirming that Stepney and Coughlan approached the team regarding "job opportunities" in June 2007. Honda said that no confidential information had been offered or received.

Lithium oxide

Lithium oxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is LiO. It contains lithium and oxide ions. 

Lithium oxide is a white solid. It is a strong base. It is corrosive when dissolved in water. Lithium oxide dissolves in water to make lithium hydroxide. It reacts with acids to make lithium salts. It reacts with carbon dioxide to form lithium carbonate. Lithium carbonate is much less corrosive. It makes a red color in a flame.

When lithium is burned to air, it forms lithium oxide. This reaction also makes lithium nitride. It can also be made by heating lithium peroxide. 

It is used as a flux in glazing ceramics. It can be used in scientific research. It could also be used in lithium ion batteries.

Lithium oxide is very corrosive. It reacts with water to make lithium hydroxide. It is toxic because of its strong alkalinity (being a base).

Lithium chloride

Lithium chloride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is LiCl. It contains lithium and chloride ions.

Lithium chloride is a colorless solid. It makes a bright red color in a flame. It absorbs water, unlike other alkali metal chlorides. It also dissolves more easily in water than other alkali metal chlorides.

Lithium chloride can be made by igniting lithium and chlorine, but it is difficult because the reaction is violent. This makes the anhydrous (without water attached) form. Another way is mixing lithium oxide, lithium hydroxide, or lithium carbonate with hydrochloric acid. This makes the hydrate (water attached to the molecule). The hydrous form can be dried to the anhydrous form by heating it with hydrogen chloride gas.

Lithium chloride is used to make lithium metal. Lithium chloride is melted and electrolyzed. This makes liquid lithium metal. It is used to dry air. It is also used as a flux for aluminium. It can be used in making organic compounds. It can be used to color flames red.

Lithium chloride is somewhat toxic. It was going to be used as a salt substitute but people found that it is toxic. It affects the central nervous system.

<doc id="257936" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=257936" title="Oxidation state">
Oxidation state

Oxidation state refers to the number of electrons added to or removed from an element. Sodium metal, for example, has an oxidation state of 0 in the elemental state. But when it gives up its one valence (outer) electron (symbolized by e), it becomes a sodium ion with an oxidation state of +1. Iron is another example. It can lose two electrons, forming an oxidation state of +2; or it can lose 3, forming an oxidation state of +3. 

If elements gain electrons, they have negative oxidation states. If chlorine gains an electron, it forms a -1 ion. If sulfur gains two electrons, it forms a -2 ion. 

The oxidation state determines the number of atoms of other elements that can to the atom.

All elements have an oxidation state of 0.

<doc id="257938" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=257938" title="Oxidizing agent">
Oxidizing agent

Oxidizing agent can have two meanings. In a more specific sense, it can be a chemical that releases oxygen atoms. For example, potassium chlorate has a chemical formula of KClO. When it oxidizes a reducing agent, such as powdered aluminum metal, it loses its oxygen to the aluminum and becomes potassium chloride, KCl. Another definition would be: a chemical that accepts electrons from a reducing agent. For example, potassium permanganate has an oxidation state of +7. In acid solution, it gains 5 electrons (e), becoming a manganese compound with an oxidation state of +2. Most oxidizing agents of the second (electron-accepting) definition have oxygen, but not all. For example, fluorine (F), the most powerful oxidizing agent, does not have any oxygen in it. When it acts as an oxidizing agent, it gains an electron to transfer from an oxidation state of 0 to an oxidation state of -1.

<doc id="257940" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=257940" title="Reducing agent">
Reducing agent

Reducing agent refers to a chemical that gives away electrons to another chemical compound, the oxidizing agent. For example, zinc is a reducing agent. When it reacts with an oxidizing agent, it gives up two electrons, changing its oxidation state from 0 to +2 (all elements have an oxidation state of 0).

<doc id="257943" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=257943" title="Reduction (chemistry)">
Reduction (chemistry)

Reduction is any chemical reaction that involves the gain of electrons. Specifically, it refers to the side that accepts electrons. 

When iron reacts with oxygen it forms a chemical called rust. In that example, the iron is oxidized and the oxygen is reduced.

Reduction is the opposite of oxidation. A reduction reaction always comes together with an oxidation reaction. Oxidation and reduction together are called redox.

Electroplating

Electroplating is the coating of an object with a metal. It is done by immersing the object and a bar of the metal in a solution containing the metal ions. Electric current is applied; the positive goes to the metal and the negative goes to the object. The metal bar dissolves in the solution and plates out on the object, forming a thin but durable coating of metal. It is often used to gold-plate objects for decoration or corrosion resistance.

Potassium hydroxide

Potassium hydroxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is KOH. It contains potassium and hydroxide ions.

It is a white powder. It dissolves easily in water to make a basic solution. It is corrosive to skin. It reacts with acids to give potassium salts. It is less common than sodium hydroxide. About 700,000 tons are made each year. It is hygroscopic, meaning that it absorbs water from the air and forms a solution. It is very hard to get the water out again. It releases heat when it is dissolved in water, similar to sodium hydroxide. It gradually reacts with carbon dioxide in the air to form potassium carbonate. It melts easily. It feels greasy when it gets on the skin because it makes soap from the fat in your skin. It is made when potassium reacts with water. 

It is made by electrolysis of a potassium chloride solution. It can also be made by reacting calcium hydroxide with potassium carbonate. The calcium carbonate precipitates and is filtered, leaving potassium hydroxide.

Calcium chloride

Calcium chloride is a chemical compound made of calcium and chlorine atoms. It has the formula CaCl. It absorbs water from the air and releases heat when it is dissolved in water. It is used as a de-icer on roads to melt the ice. It can be formed by mixture of calcium oxide with hydrochloric acid, but this produces a version that is hydrated (has water molecules attached to it). The anhydrous (no water molecules attached) form is needed most of the time. Calcium chloride is melted at a high temperature and electrolyzed to produce calcium metal.

Potassium chloride

Potassium chloride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is KCl. It contains potassium and chloride ions. 

It is a colorless crystalline solid. It is not reactive. It is similar to sodium chloride. It reacts with silver nitrate to make silver chloride. It reacts with sodium metal when very hot to make potassium metal. The metals are a gas because it is so hot. It makes a pink color when heated in a flame. 

Potassium chloride is found as a mineral. The mineral is called sylvite. It is also found in sylvanite, a mixture of sodium chloride and potassium chloride.

It is taken from the ocean. It can also be processed from the mineral sylvite or sylvanite. It is made when potassium nitrate is reacted with hydrochloric acid, making nitric acid and potassium chloride. It is made when potassium burns in chlorine.

It is used to make potassium metal. Potassium chloride is heated very hot until it melts. Sodium metal is reacted with it. The sodium metal melts and boils to make sodium gas. The sodium gas reacts with the potassium chloride to make potassium gas and sodium chloride. It can be electrolyzed in a water solution to make potassium hydroxide. It is used in food processing. It can be used to execute people in a lethal injection. It is used instead of table salt sometimes. Normally it is half table salt and half potassium chloride. It can be used to extinguish fires. It was used to make packs that get hot when squeezed, but better chemicals are used now. 

Potassium chloride is toxic in very large amounts. When injected into a vein it is much more toxic.

Wonderwall (song)

Wonderwall is a single by the rock band Oasis. It was written by Noel Gallagher. Wonderwall comes from "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?", Oasis's second album. The song also appears on "Stop the Clocks" and "Time Flies... 1994-2009". It was the only song that reached the top 10 in America on the Hot 100 for Oasis. It also reached number 1 in four countries and reached the top 10 in 10 countries.
Noel Gallagher says the song was written about a girl he met at a concert when he was touring with Oasis.
It is said that "Wonderwall" was written for Gallagher's then-girlfriend, Meg Mathews. Gallagher now says the song was not about her, but he did say "The meaning of that song was taken away from me by the media who jumped on it. How do you tell your Mrs it's not about her once she's read it is? It's a song about an imaginary friend who's gonna come and save you from yourself."

In 2008 Liam Gallagher said this about the song: "I can't fucking stand that fucking song! Every time I have to sing it I want to gag. Problem is, it was a big, big tune for us." Noel said that Liam, "...thought we had gone too dance when I wrote 'Wonderwall' because the drums didn't go boom-boom bap, boom-boom bap." 

The song was recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales in May of 1995. According to producer Owen Morris, the song was done in 6 to 8 hours.

In the beginning, Noel wanted to sing this song, but he gave his brother Liam Gallagher the choice, and Noel ended up singing "Don't Look Back in Anger". He later said he had only ever wanted to sing "Don't Look Back in Anger", and had used "Wonderwall" as a bargaining tool.

The music video to the song was filmed in the short period when bassist Paul "Guigsy" McGuigan quit the band due to nervous exhaustion; Scott McLeod came in to replace him.

The song won Best British Video at the 1996 Brit Awards.

V10 engine

A V10 engine often just called a V10 is an internal combustion engine with 10 cylinders. The engine has five cylinders on each side called banks. The two banks form a "V" shaped angle. All ten pistons turn a common crankshaft. A V10 engine can be powered by different types of fuels, inlcuding gasoline, diesel and natural gas.

Until recently, V10s had rarely used for road cars. A V12 runs smoother and is only a little harder to build. A V8 is eaiser to build and costs less to run. New technology has made the use V10 engines more practical.

Dodge designing a V10 for use in trucks. The engine was revised and used in the Dodge Viper. Ford developed a heavy-duty V10 engine for use in their trucks. 

European car builders later adopted the V10 configuration. High power V10 engines wer put into supercars from Lamborghini and Porsche. BMW and Audi then added V10s to their mid-range cars. Volkswagen developed a V10 turbodiesel engine.

The largest use of the V10 engines has been in Formula One racing. Alfa Romeo made the first modern Formula One V10 in 1986, but it was never used in a race car. Later the V10 was introduced by Honda and Renault before the season. After turbocharged were baned, the V10 engine to use. V10 engines were the only type used from the 1998 season. V10s were banned for the season and Formula One teams started using V8 engines. 

There are other cars with V10 engines in auto racing. The most common is the Judd engine.

"Ironic" became Morissette's second number-one hit on the "Billboard" Modern Rock Tracks chart in the United States. It stayed there for three weeks. The song became Morissette's highest-charting hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it peaked at number four. It is one of only two songs by Morissette to crack the top-ten on that chart, the other being "You Learn", backed with a live version of "You Oughta Know", which reached number six. Both songs were from "Jagged Little Pill". In other countries, "Ironic" wasn't as successful. It was still a moderate Top 20 hit in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number 11. It is considered to be one of Morissette's biggest hits. The song also received critical praise at the time of its release. "Ironic" is still popular today, mainly because there are still debates surrounding the lyrics of the song, and whether the examples mentioned in the song actually qualify as being ironic.

The pop-punk band Four Year Strong covered the song in their 90's cover album "Explains It All."

A V8 engine often just called a V8 is an internal combustion engine with 8 cylinders. The engine has four cylinders on each side called banks. The two banks form a "V" shaped angle. In most engines, the two banks are at a right angle (90°) to each other, but some engines use a narrower angle. All eight pistons turn a common crankshaft. It can be powered by different types of fuels, inlcuding gasoline, diesel, natural gas and alcohol.

Generally, V8s are only available on more powerful cars, pickup trucks, and SUVs. The traditional 90° large V8 engine is generally too wide and too long to fit easily in vehicles with a front-wheel drive layout, so its application is mostly limited to rear-wheel drive cars and trucks. 

V8s are common in purpose-designed engines for racing cars. They are a common engine configuration in the highest levels of auto racing. The V8 engine is used in the United States where it is required in IRL and NASCAR. V8s engines are also used in Australian auto racing, most notably in the V8 Supercars. Formula One began the 2006 season using V8 engines, which replaced the V10. Formula One made this change to reduce costs and lower power.

V8 engines are also used in large truck and industrial equipment. V8s were an early choice for airplane engines. Modern aircraft seldom used V8s because the heavy weight reduces performance.

Much of the wildlife is threatened by introduced species and weeds. However, the eucalyptus wooded savannah, tropical rainforests, and other types of habitat are now recognized as being globally important. 
The Cape York Peninsula region covers an area of about 137,000 km² north of 16°S latitude. From the tip of the peninsula, Cape York, it is about to New Guinea across the island and coral reefs of Torres Strait. 

The west coast is bordered by the Gulf of Carpentaria and the east coast by the Coral Sea. There is no clear border to the south, but the boundary in the Cape York Peninsula Heritage Act 2007 of Queensland follows the 16°S latitude). 

At the peninsula’s widest point, it is 430 km from the Bloomfield River, on the east coast, to the Aboriginal community of Kowanyama on the west coast. It is some 660 km from the southern border, to the tip of Cape York. The largest islands in the Torres Strait include Prince of Wales Island, Horn Island, Moa, and Badu Island. 

Cape York is the northern most point on the Australian continent. It was named by Lieutenant James Cook on 21 August, 1770, after Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany. The Duke was a brother of King George III of the United Kingdom, and died from illness in 1767 when he was only 20 years old:

The peninsula is an extremely eroded, almost level, low plain with mighty meandering rivers and vast floodplains. There are some very low hills, about 800m above sea level in the McIlwraith Range on the eastern side around Coen. 

Part of Australia’s Great Dividing Range, the Peninsula Ridge, is like a backbone along the peninsula. This mountain range is made up of ancient (1,500 million year-old) Precambrian and Palaeozoic rocks. To the east and west of the Peninsula Ridge lie the Carpentaria and Laura Basins, themselves made up of ancient Mesozoic sediments. There are several important landforms on the peninsula: the large area of undisturbed sand dunes on the east coast around Shelburne Bay and Cape Bedford-Cape Flattery; the huge piles of black granite boulders at Black Mountain National Park and Cape Melville; and the limestone karsts around Palmerston in the south.

The soils are poor, even compared to other areas of Australia. They are ancient and weathered, not suitable for ploughing and do not respond to fertilizers. Because of the poor soil, the region is thinly settled. Attempts to grow commercial crops have usually failed.

The climate on Cape York Peninsula is tropical and monsoonal. The heavy monsoon season is from November to April, during which time the forest becomes almost inhabitable. The dry season is from May to October. The temperature is warm to hot, with a cooler climate in higher areas. The mean annual temperatures range from 18 °C at higher elevations to 27 °C on the lowlands in the drier south-west. Temperatures over 40 °C and below 5 °C are rare.

Annual rainfall is high, ranging from over 2000 mm. in the Iron Range and north of Weipa to about 700 mm. at the southern border. Most of this rain falls between November and April. Only on the eastern slopes of the Iron Range is the median rainfall between June and September above 5mm (0.2 inches). Between January and March, however, the median monthly rainfall ranges from about 170mm (6.5 inches) in the south to over 500mm (20 inches) in the north and on the Iron Range.

The Peninsula Ridge forms the drainage divide between the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Coral Sea. To the west, large, winding river systems including the Mitchell, Coleman, Holroyd, Archer, Watson, Wenlock, Ducie and Jardine flow into the Gulf of Carpentaria. During the Dry season, those rivers become a series of waterholes and sandy beds. Yet, with the heavy rains in the Wet season, they become mighty waterways, spreading across huge floodplains and coastal wetlands and giving life to many freshwater and wetland species.

On the Eastern slopes, the shorter, faster-flowing Jacky Jacky Creek, Olive, Pascoe, Lockhart, Stewart, Jeannie and Endeavour Rivers flow towards the Coral Sea. These provide important freshwater and nutrients to the healthiest section of the Great Barrier Reef. Along their banks, those wild, undisturbed rivers are lined with dense rainforests, sand dunes or mangroves.

The floodplains of the Laura Basin are now protected in the Lakefield and Jack River National Parks. The plains are crossed by the Morehead, Hann, North Kennedy, Laura, Jack and Normanby Rivers.

The Peninsula’s rivers are famous for their hydrological integrity. This means that they are still in their natural state, with water flows and vegetation unchanged. Cape York Peninsula is one of the few places where tropical water cycles remain unchanged. Cape York Peninsula has as much as a quarter of Australia's surface runoff. With less than 3% of Australia's land area it produces more run-off than all of Australia south of the Tropic of Capricorn. The peninsula’s rivers are also important as they put water back into central Australia’s Great Artesian Basin. The Queensland Government is planning to protect 13 of Cape York Peninsula’s wild rivers under the Wild Rivers Act 2005.

Around 40 million years ago, the Indo-Australian tectonic plate began to split apart from the ancient supercontinent Gondwana. As it crashed into the Pacific Plate on its northward journey, the high mountain ranges of central New Guinea were made around 5 million years ago. Protected from this collision zone, the ancient rocks of what is now Cape York Peninsula were did not move.

During the Pleistocene epoch Australia and New Guinea have been land-linked and separated by water a number of times. During the ice ages with their low sea levels, Cape York Peninsula was a low-lying land bridge. Another link existed between Arnhem Land and New Guinea, at times making a big freshwater lake, Lake Carpentaria, in the centre of what is now the Gulf of Carpentaria. In this way, Australia and New Guinea were joined until the shallow Torres Strait was last flooded around 8,000 years ago.

Cape York Peninsula has a range of intact tropical rainforests, tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands, tropical savannahs, heath lands, wetlands, wild rivers and mangrove swamps. These are home to about 3300 species of flowering plants. Almost all of the Cape York Peninsula (99.6%) still has its native vegetation. Cape York Peninsula also contains one of the highest rates of endemism in Australia, with more than 260 endemic plant species found so far. Because of this, parts of the Peninsula have been noted for their very high wilderness quality. The plants of the peninsula includes original Gondwanan species, plants that have developed since the breakup of Gondwana and species from Indo-Malaya and from across the Torres Strait in New Guinea. Most variety is found in the rainforest areas. Most of the Cape York Peninsula is drier than New Guinea which stops the rainforest plants of that island from moving across to Australia. 

Most of the Cape York Peninsula is covered in grass and woodlands. These have a tall, thick grass layer and scattered trees, mostly eucalypts. The most common tree is the Darwin stringybark. Although common and complete on the peninsula, tropical savannahs are now rare and in poor condition in other parts of the world.

Tropical rainforests cover an area of 748,000 ha, or 5.6 percent of the total land area of Cape York Peninsula. Rainforests need some rainfall during the long Dry season. These conditions are mostly found on the eastern slopes of the Cape’s coastal ranges. These are old-growth forests and support a huge range of plants. These rainforests are of high conservation significance. The largest rainforest area on the Cape is in the McIllwraith Range-Iron Range area. The Gondwanan plants of this area includes Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae conifers and Arthrochilus, Corybas, and Calochilus orchids. This rainforest has at least 1000 different plants, including 100 rare or threatened species, and 16% of Australia's orchid species.

On poor, dry soils tropical heathlands can be found. North-east Cape York Peninsula has Australia’s largest areas of this highly diverse ecosystem.

The big wetlands on Cape York Peninsula are “among the largest, richest and most diverse in Australia”. 19 wetlands of national significance have been identified, mostly on the large floodplains and in coastal areas. Important wetlands include the Jardine River National Park, Lakefield National Park and the estuaries of the great rivers of the western plains. Many of these wetland only happen during the Wet season and have rare or uncommon plant types. 

The Peninsula’s coastal areas and river estuaries are lined with mangrove forests of kwila and other trees. Australia’s largest mangrove forest can be found at Newcastle Bay.

The Cape has lots of animals, with more than 700 vertebrate land animal species . Of these 40 are are found are only found here. Because of its geological history, the plants and animals "of Cape York Peninsula are a complex mixture of Gondwanan relics, Australian isolationists and Asian or New Guinean invaders” (p. 41). Birds include Buff-breasted Buttonquail (Turnix olivii), Golden-shouldered Parrot "(Psephotus chrysopterygius)", Lovely Fairywren "(Malurus amabilis)", White-streaked Honeyeater "(Trichodere cockerelli)", and Yellow-spotted Honeyeater "(Meliphaga notata)". Some such as Pied Oystercatcher are found in other parts of Australia but have important populations on the peninsula. The Cape is also home to the Eastern brown snake, one of the world's most venomous snakes. Mammals include the endangered rodent Bramble Cay Melomys, found only on Bramble Cay in the Torres Strait.

The rainforests of the Iron Range have species that are also found in New Guinea, including the Eclectus Parrot and Southern Common Cuscus. Other rainforest animals includes 200 species of butterfly including 11 endemic butterflies one of which is the huge Green Birdwing, the Green Tree Python and the Northern Quoll. Number of this forest marsupial have dropped because they have tried to eat the introduced poisonous cane toads. 

The riverbanks of the lowlands are home to specific wildlife of their own. The rivers including the Jardine, Jackson, Olive, Holroyd and the Wenlock are rich in fish. The wetlands and coastal mangroves are noted for their importance as a fish nursery and crocodile habitat, providing important drought refuge . The Great Barrier Reef lies off the east coast and is an important marine habitat.

Cattle farms use about 57% of the total area, mostly in central and eastern Cape York Peninsula. Indigenous land comprises about 20%, with the entire West coast being held under Native title. The remainder is mostly National Park and managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service. Land uses include broad acre pastoralism, bauxite and silica sand mining, nature reserves, tourism and fishing. There are big deposits of bauxite along the west or Gulf of Carpentaria coast. Weipa is the centre for mining. Much has been damaged by overgrazing, mining, fires, wild pigs, cane toads, weeds, and other introduced species. But Cape York Peninsula remains fairly unspoilt with intact and healthy river systems and no recorded plant or animal extinction since European settlement. 

The "Cape York Peninsula Land Use Strategy" study, by the Australian government in 1990, created plans to protect the wilderness. A nomination for World Natural Heritage is currently being looked at by the Queensland and Australian Federal governments. Major national parks include the Jardine River National Park in the far north, Mungkan Kandju National Park near Aurukun, and Lakefield National Park in the southeast of the bioregion.

The first known contact between Europeans and Aborigines took place on the west coast of the peninsula in 1606. It was not settled by Europeans until the 19th century when fishing communities, then cattle ranches and later mining towns were started. European settlement led to the displacement of Aboriginal communities and the arrival of Torres Strait Islanders on the mainland. Today the peninsula has a population of about 18,000, of which a large percentage (~60 %) are Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. 

The administrative and commercial centre for much of Cape York Peninsula is Cooktown, located in its far south-eastern corner. The peninsula’s largest settlement is the mining town Weipa on the Gulf of Carpentaria. Most of the Peninsula has few people, with half the population living in very small settlements and cattle ranches. Along the Peninsula Developmental Road, there are small service centres at Lakeland, Laura and Coen. At the tip of Cape York, there is a sizeable service centre on nearby Thursday Island. Aboriginal communities are at Hopevale, Pormpuraaw, Kowanyama, Aurukun, Lockhart River, Napranum, Mapoon, Injinoo, New Mapoon and Umagico. Torres Strait Islander communities on the mainland are at Bamaga and Seisia. A completely sealed inland road links Cairns and the Atherton Tableland to Lakeland Downs and Cooktown. The road north of Lakeland Downs to the tip of the Peninsula is sometimes cut after heavy rains during the wet season (roughly December to May).

The Peninsula is a popular with tourists in the Dry Season for camping, hiking, birdwatching and fishing. Many people make the adventurous, but rewarding, drive to the tip of Cape York, the northernmost point of mainland Australia. 

Some of the world's most extensive and ancient Aboriginal rock painting galleries surround the town of Laura, some of which are available for public viewing. There is also a new Interpretive Centre from which information on the rock art and local culture is available and tours can be arranged.
As weather permits, the next total eclipse of the sun should be visible from Cape York, Australia, as well as some northern islands of New Zealand. This eclipse will occur on November 13, 2012.

Crankshaft

The crankshaft, sometimes casually called the "crank", is the part of an engine which changes the up and down motion of the pistons into rotation. To convert the motion, the crankshaft has one or more offset shafts. The pistons are connected to the crankshaft by these shafts. When the piston moves up and down, it pushes the offset shaft. This in turn rotates the crankshaft.

The pistons cause a pulsing affect in the rotation. A crankshaft usually connects to a flywheel. The flywheel smooths out the rotation. Sometimes there is a torsion or vibration damper on the other end of the crankshaft. This helps reduce vibrations of the crankshaft. 

Large engines usually have several cylinders. This helps to reduce pulsations from individual firing strokes. For some engines it is necessary to provide counterweights. The counterweight is used to offset the piston and improve balance. While counterweights add a lot of weight to the crankshaft, it provides a smoother running engine. This allows higher RPMs to be reached and more power produced.

Thongchai McIntyre

Thongchai "Bird" McIntyre, who was born as Albert Thongchai McIntyre on December 8, 1958, is a Thai pop singer. He released his debut album in 1986. He is the most successful singer in Thailand, as he sold more than 20 million albums. He is also sometimes called the following names:

Thongchai McIntyre, or "Bird Thongchai", is best known for his "string (Thai pop)" and "luk thung music". He is also known for acting in numerous films, on the television, musicals, and in commercials.

Thongchai McIntyre was born in Bangkok in 1958. His parents were James and Udom McIntyre. He lived in a family of musicians, and so, he enjoyed an upbringing in a musical environment. His father died when Bird was still a child. He started working in a bank as an officer. During that time, he had a chance to meet the famous Thai TV producer, "Kai Varayuth", who saw entertainment talent in Bird. Bird played his first TV series with Kai while still working in the bank. This task showed his talent. His most memorable roles were those of "Captain Kobori" from "Koo Kam", which was a tragic love story between a Japanese soldier (played by Bird) and a local Thai girl during the World War II. In both, he starred in a television series, and he reprised his role in the 1996 film adaptation, "Sunset at Chaophraya".

He reached the top of his musical career in the early nineties. Some of Bird's best-known songs are "Duay Rak Lae Pook Pan", "Koo Gud", "Sabai Sabai" and "Kob Jai Jing Jing". His popular singles released recently include luk thung singles "Mah Tummai" (with Jintara Poonlarp), "Fan Ja" (with Jintara and Jarin B. (Joey Boy), Nat Myria Benedetti and Katreeya English), "Lao Su Kan Fang", and "Yak Tham Kor Tob" and "Mai Kang Ying Pae" from his album "Volume One". Westerners became aware of him in the mid nineties as he became the first Thai artist to receive an International MTV Award, be featured in the most high budget Thai film at the time, "Sunset at Chaopraya" (which reached international acclaim in Japan as well as the United States). He was featured on CNN and Variety magazine. An award winning documentary on his life entitled "Crossing Borders" directed by Phanjanit Garnploog can be seen at St. John's University in New York which includes rare interviews with the director. In 2010, Bird made his first international tour in Los Angeles and the 50th Anniversary of Lincoln Center in New York. It marks the first time in history a Thai pop artist has made an international tour. His Grammy label mates have previously only performed at local venues. 

In late 2007, he released another album entitled "Simply Bird", which features songs such as Chuay Rap Tee and Mee Tae Kid Tueng.

Don't Look Back in Anger

"Don't Look Back in Anger" is a song by English rock band Oasis. It was released in 1996 as the fourth single from their second album "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?". The song was written by the band's former guitarist and main songwriter, Noel Gallagher. The song became the band's second single to reach #1 in the UK Singles Chart. It also went platinum. "Don't Look Back in Anger" was also the first Oasis single to feature Noel on lead vocals instead of his brother, Liam Gallagher.

The single cover is showing respects to the incident where Ringo Starr briefly left The Beatles during the recording of The White Album.

The B-side "Step Out" was originally intended for the (What's the Story) Morning Glory? album but was taken off after Stevie Wonder requested 10% of the royalties as the chorus like his hit "Uptight (Everything's Alright)". Henry Cosby and Sylvia Moy received credit for writing the song along with Noel.

"Don't Look Back in Anger" was met with high critical praise and it became a commercial hit.

Sir Edward Bairstow (born Huddersfield, 22 August 1874; died York 1 May 1946) was an English composer and organist. He was an important influence in 20th century Anglican church music.

Bairstow learned the organ at Balliol College, Oxford, and while articled under Frederick Bridge of Westminster Abbey he was taught by Walter Alcock. He studied organ and theory at the University of Durham. His first jobs were at the parish churches of Wigan and then Leeds. In 1913 he became organist of York Minster (the cathedral in York). He kept this job until his death. He was knighted in 1932.

Most of Bairstow's compositions are for church services. He wrote 29 anthems. It includes the famous "Blessed city, heavenly Salem" It has a very dramatic organ accompaniment. It is about the heavenly city where the souls of people who have died will go. Two other popular anthems "I sat down under his shadow" and "Let all mortal flesh keep silence", both of which are for unaccompanied choir. He also composed service settings, psalm chants, hymn tunes, and a cantata, "The Prodigal Son", for choir and chamber orchestra.

The chloralkali process is a process used to create sodium hydroxide, chlorine, and hydrogen from sodium chloride and water. It is normally conducted in a tank separated by a membrane, although there are other methods, such as using mercury. If potassium chloride or calcium chloride is used instead, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide are produced. When the membrane is not in place, hypochlorites are formed. If it is heated, chlorates are formed. 

The process is fueled by electrolysis. It can be done in the laboratory.

Season One (Book 1: Water) of had 20 episodes and they were shown from 21 February 2005 until 2 December 2005. The series was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, and starred Zach Tyler Eisen, Mae Whitman, Jack DeSena, Mako, Dante Basco, and Jason Isaacs as the .

The season goes around the protagonist, Aang, and his friends Katara and Sokka and their journey to the North Pole (to North Water Tribe) to find a Waterbending master to teach Aang and Katara how to control water. Fire Lord Ozai, the current Fire Lord of the , is waging a seemingly endless war against the , the Water Tribes, and the already destroyed Air Nomads. Aang, the current Avatar, must master the four elements—Air, Water, Earth, and Fire—before win the Fire Lord and ending the war. Along the way, Aang and his friends are chased by various pursuers, including Prince Zuko, a banished Fire Nation prince, and Admiral Zhao, a key member of the Fire Navy.

Each episode of Season One attracted more than a million viewers on its first airing. Season One won "Best TV Series" and "Best Animated Television Series" in the boys 9–14-year old demographic at the 2005 Pulcinella Awards, which gives awards for excellence in animation.

Between 4 January 2006 and 19 September 2006, five DVD sets were released in the USA, each had four episodes from the season. On 12 September 2006, Nickelodeon also released the "Complete Book One Collection Box Set", which had all of the episodes in the season as well as a special features disc. The original releases were encoded in Region 1 (USA), a DVD type that plays only in American DVD players. From 2007 to 2009, Nickelodeon released Region 2 DVDs (Europe), which can play in Europe.

The first has been adapted into a live-action film "The Last Airbender", directed by M. Night Shyamalan and was released in July 2010.

The show was produced by and shown on Nickelodeon, which is owned by Viacom. The show's creators, Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, worked with Aaron Ehasz. Eight episodes were directed by Dave Filoni. Animation directors Lauren MacMullan and Giancarlo Volpe directed five episodes each, and Anthony Lioi directed two. Episodes were written or co-written by a team of writers, which included Nick Malis, John O'Bryan, Matt Hubbard, James Eagan, Ian Wilcox, Tim Hedrick and Elizabeth Welch Ehasz. All of the show's music was written by "The Track Team", which consists of Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn, who were known to Dante and Konietzko because Zuckerman was Konietzko's roommate.

Film critics appreciated the first season of "Avatar" because it attracted the attention of "an audience beyond the children's market with crisp animation and layered storytelling." Lesley Aeschliman from Helium.com, said that she "enjoy[s] the storytelling of this series" and said that "the ending of each episode leaves you wanting to see more." Another reporter from Helium.com, Nicki Marks said: As for the video and picture quality, Gord Lacey from TVShowsOnDVD.com said that "the colors are bright, and the picture is nearly flawless." He said later in the review that "the audio is very nice, with lots of directional effects and nice musical cues." Barnes & Noble reviewer Christina Urban praised the season's masterful combination of "elements from Chinese kung fu, Tibetan philosophy, Japanese martial arts forms, and even Hindu spiritual beliefs". According to Aaron Bynum from AnimationInsider.net, "the series posted double digit year-to-year gains in May". He also said that the show has been number one in the boys 9–14-year old demographic, and has attracted many age and gender groups in its pool of 1.1 million viewers who watch each new episode.

In addition, the season has won many awards during its runtime. During the 33rd Annual Annie Awards, the show was nominated for the "Best Animated Television Production" award. Because of the episode "The Fortuneteller", the show was nominated for the "Writing for an Animated Television Production" award. For the episode "The Deserter", the season was nominated for and won the "Storyboarding in an Animated Television Production" award. During the 2005 Pulcinella Awards, the season won the "Best Action/Adventure TV Series" award as well and the general "Best TV Series" award.

Nickelodeon began releasing the Season One DVDs on 31 January 2006. Each DVD, with one exception, had four episodes on one disc. The exception was The Complete Book One Collection Box Set, which had all of the 20 episodes in the season on six discs.

In the USA, all Season One DVDs were encoded using NTSC. Since this is not compatible in most countries outside North America, Nickelodeon released separate DVDs in regions where the video would be encoded using PAL instead. These releases began on 19 February 2007; each DVD was released months after the original release. As with the original DVDs, each set contained four episodes on one disc, with the exception would be The Complete Book One Collection Box Set, which contained all of the twenty episodes in the season on five discs.

"The Last Airbender" is a live action film based on the first season of the animated television series and had a theatrical release on 1 July 2010. The film is directed by M. Night Shyamalan.

Just to be clear. I didn't say he couldn't do it. But that he might want to think about what he was doing, because almost all of them qualify for speedy deletion under the unlikely typo speedy criteria. While I agree redirects are cheap, creating a few hundred redirects for no good reason is a waste of resources and your time.

Howdy Simple!

I have been hired as staff with the Wikimedia Foundation currently working full time remotely in Boston through January 31st 2011 but with a goal to transition that into a full time position in San Francisco as the appointment comes to a close. While I will be cutting down on my IRC channels I will remain in at least simple-admins and will in many ways be "available" for help even more then usual since I'll be on while working. I may at times be slow to respond because of work responsibilities (I will be focusing on the fundraiser for now). 

I just resigned my Checkusership on Meta for at least the next 6 months. I have also been asked to relinquish my crat rights for now (my boss Philippe would prefer staff not have the local ability to create sysops), I was allowed to keep it if I thought Simple needed it but to be honest I think we have enough that I wasn't too worried about the project would be in trouble if I gave it up. I did want to keep it though :(. My local statuses will have to be revisited if I transition to permanent staff but for now it is temporary.

I am confident that this won't disrupt the project too much and do not anticipate ignoring Simple. In fact I anticipate forcing you all to comment and take part in the fundraiser if possible :P.

<doc id="258272" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=258272" title="March (music)">
March (music)

In music a march is a piece of music with a strong marching rhythm. Marches are often written especially so that soldiers can march to them. Other marches may not be intended for marching, but they still have a strong, regular beat so that people could, if they wanted to, march to the music. Marches are usually 2/4 time (One - two - one - two - left - right - left- right) or 4/4 (the same as two bars (measures)) although other time signatures are possible.

Marches can be slow marches or quick marches. A slow march may be a funeral march.

John Philip Sousa was a composer whose marches became extremely popular (e.g. "Colonel Bogey's March").

In classical music many composers wrote marches which are not intended to be marched to, but still give the mood of a march. Some famous examples of funeral marches include the second movement of Beethoven's "Eroica" Symphony, the "Marche funèbre" (Funeral March) in Chopin's "Piano Sonata in B flat minor", and the "Dead March" in Handel's oratorio "Saul". 

Gustav Mahler often wrote marches in his symphonies. Marches often occur in operas (e.g.Verdi's "Aïda"), ballets (e.g. Prokofiev's "Romeo and Juliet") or, indeed, any kind of music. 

Music composed for marching uses instruments that soldiers play in marching bands, such as brass instruments, woodwind instruments including fife, snare drum and bass drum. Composers writing marches in classical music may imitate the sound of military bands by using these instruments.

March music is often composed for special ceremonial occasions such as coronations. Edward Elgar and William Walton both wrote march music for coronations.

Roll with It (Oasis song)

"Roll with It" is a song by the rock band Oasis. It is written by their former lead guitarist Noel Gallagher. The song was released on August 14, 1995 as the second single from their second album "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?". It reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart. The songwriting started off as a copy of early Beatles songs, mainly She Loves You and From Me To You.

"Roll with It" received a lot of attention when Food Records, the label of Britpop rivals Blur, moved the original release date of single "Country House" to match "Roll with its release date", sparking what came to be known as "The Battle of Britpop". The British media had already reported an intense rivalry between the two bands. This clash of releases was seen as a battle for the number one spot. In the end, Blur's "Country House" single sold 274,000 copies to Oasis' 216,000 copies of "Roll with It". The singles charted at number 1 and number 2, respectively.

The song is like other Oasis songs, such as "Supersonic", because it tells the importance of being yourself.

The melody for this song appears in The Lemonheads' song "Purple Parallelogram", which was co-written by Gallagher and Evan Dando.

It was the 20th biggest selling single of 1995 in the United Kingdom.

Potassium chlorate

Potassium chlorate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is KClO. It has potassium and chlorate ions. 

It is a colorless crystalline solid. It dissolves in water. It is a strong oxidizing agent. It gives off oxygen when heated. Sometimes manganese(IV) oxide is used to make the oxygen come faster. It can explode when mixed with a strong reducing agent. It can make many things burn that don't normally burn.

It is made by electrolysis of a hot solution of potassium chloride. This is similar to the chloralkali process. It can also be made by reacting concentrated sodium chlorate with potassium chloride. 

It is used in fireworks. It is a part of Armstrong's mixture, a sensitive explosive. It is also used to make oxygen gas in high school and college labs. It can burn sugar when mixed with sugar and concentrated sulfuric acid. It can also replace potassium nitrate in gunpowder. It is used in oxygen candles. Oxygen candles made oxygen when burned. They are used in spaceships.

Potassium chlorate is a strong oxidizing agent and can catch many things on fire. When it is mixed with sulfur or phosphorus, it burns very easily. Many other chemicals can make dangerous mixtures with potassium chlorate.

The Masterplan (song)

"The Masterplan" is a song by English rock band Oasis. It was written by lead guitarist, Noel Gallagher.

The song was first released as a B-side to the CD version of their hit single "Wonderwall" in October 1995. "The Masterplan" was also released with the "Stop the Clocks" EP in November 2006. It also shares the name with the 1998 B-side compilation album, "The Masterplan", on which it is featured as the last track.

Noel Gallagher has regularly declared "The Masterplan" as one of the best songs he has ever written. However, he regrets the fact that it was first released as a B-side, admitting he was "young and stupid", when he made that decision. He also claims that Creation Records boss, Alan McGee, upon hearing the song, told Noel it was "too good" to be a B-side. Noel reportedly replied, "Well, I don't write shit songs!".

"The Masterplan" is sung by Noel, and features all band members except for Liam Gallagher, in addition to an orchestra. The song features a backwards guitar solo after the first chorus. Approximately 30 seconds from the end of the song, Noel can be heard singing the chorus from "Octopus's Garden" by The Beatles.

The song is included in Oasis' album "Stop the Clocks". An animated video was created to promote the album.

Potassium iodide

Potassium iodide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is KI. It has potassium and iodide ions in it. 

It is a colorless crystalline solid. It is a weak reducing agent. It reacts with chlorine to make iodine and potassium chloride. It turns yellow when in air. This is because it reacts with oxygen and carbon dioxide to make iodine and potassium carbonate. It reacts with iodine to make the triiodide ion. That is why a solution of potassium iodide dissolves iodine. 

It is made by reacting iodine or hydriodic acid with potassium hydroxide.

It is used to supply iodine in the form of vitamin tablets or pills. It can be added to table salt to prevent a deficiency of iodine. It is also used to make silver iodide. It can be used to add iodine to organic compounds. It is used to prevent thyroid cancer by filling up the thyroid with normal iodine. After a nuclear explosion there normally is radioactive iodine in the air. The radioactive iodine collects in the thyroid and causes cancer. When the person takes potassium iodide it fills up the thyroid with iodine so no radioactive iodine can come in.

Straight-eight engine

The straight-eight engine or straight-8 is an internal combustion engine with 8 cylinders. Sometimes it is called an inline-eight engine. All eight cylinders are mounted in a straight line along one crankshaft. It can be powered by different types of fuels, inlcuding gasoline and diesel.

A straight-8 can be designed with balanced engine forces. Crankshaft vibration is present in all engines. The use of a harmonic damper is needed at the end of the crankshaft. Without the damper, the vibrations may lead to engine failure.

The straight-8 is a smooth running engine. This made it popular in luxury and racing cars of the past. The length of the engine required a long engine compartment. This makes the basic design unacceptable in modern vehicles. The design has been replaced almost completely by the shorter and sturdier V8 engine. Mercedes and BMW made straight-8 aircraft engines during World War I. The engine for aircraft use provided good aerodynamics. 

The Duesenberg brothers introduced the first successful straight-8 racing engine in 1920. Their engine placed third, fourth and sixth at the Indianapolis 500. The following year one of their cars won the French Grand Prix. The straight-8 was the engine design of choice from the late 1920s until the mid-1950s. Bugatti, Duesenberg, Alfa Romeo, Mercedes-Benz and Miller built successful racing cars with high-performance straight-8 engines in the 1920s and 1930s.

Harmonic damper

A harmonic damper is a device connected to the free end of the crankshaft of an internal combustion engine. It is needed in engines with long crankshafts, such as straight-8 engines. It is used on most engines to reduce torsional vibrations that can occure at certain speeds.

The damper consists of an inner hub attached to the end of the crankshaft. An round mass is attached to the hub by an elastic material. This become a spring-mass-damper system. By selection of the damping material and the size of the mass, the damper can be made to quiet the torsional vibrations. The overall appearance is that of a thick disk.

Tyndale Bible

The Tyndale Bible generally refers to the body of biblical translations by William Tyndale. Tyndale’s Bible is credited with being the first English translation to come directly from Hebrew and Greek texts. The term "Tyndale's Bible" is not strictly correct, because Tyndale never published a complete Bible. Prior to his execution Tyndale had only finished translating the entire New Testament and roughly half of the Old Testament.

The chain of events that led to the creation of Tyndale’s New Testament started in 1522. It was in this year that Tyndale illegally acquired a copy of Martin Luther’s German New Testament. Tyndale was inspired by Luther’s work and immediately set out to imitate Luther’s work but in English. He made his purpose known to the Bishop of London at the time Cuthbert Tunstall. However Tunstall rejected Tyndale’s offer of creating an up-to-date modern English Bible. After this rejection Tyndale moved to the continent and ended up in Hamburg where he completed his New Testament in 1524. 

The first recorded complete edition of his New Testament was published in 1526. Two revised versions were latter published in 1534 and 1536, both personally revised by Tyndale himself. After his death in 1536 Tyndale’s works have been revised and reprinted numerous times.

Tyndale’s translations were condemned by both church and state in England, where it must be said it took longer for the reform movement to take hold. Tyndale was forced to flee England for the continent where he found safe haven in pro-reform areas. The church and state reacted strongly against Tyndale’s work, banning his New Testament of 1526 from England. In addition any copy of his work found in England was to be burned. 

The legacy of Tyndale’s Bible cannot be overstated. His translations laid the foundations for many of the English Bibles which followed his. His work made up a significant portion of the Matthew Bible which was the first authorized version of the English Bible. The Tyndale Bible also played a key role in spreading reformation ideas to England which had been reluctant to embrace the movement.

Elephant birds are an extinct family of birds which can not fly. They were found only on the island of Madagascar. The group had two genera, "Aepyornis" and "Mullerornis", and seven species. Like several other flightless birds, they were hunted to extinction. 

The Elephant birds, which were giant ratites, have been extinct since at least the 17th century. Étienne de Flacourt, a French governor of Madagascar in the 1640s and 1650s, recorded frequent sightings of elephant birds. "Aepyornis", one of the world's largest birds, is believed to have been over tall, weighing close to 400 kg (880 lb). Remains of "Aepyornis" adults and eggs have been found. In some cases the eggs have a circumference of over and a length up to . The egg volume is about 160 times greater than a chicken egg.

Sozin's Comet: The Final Battle is the series finale for the Nickelodeon's television series "". It was directed by Ethan Spaulding, Giancarlo Volpe, and Joaquim Dos Santos, and written by Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko, and Aaron Ehasz. Though intended to be split into three parts, the finale aired as a two-hour four-part movie on 19 July 2008. Prior to the week of 14–19 July, no episodes had been shown since 30 November 2007. The Saturday airing of "Sozin's Comet" acted as a climax to a week of ten new episodes that concluded .

The finale focuses on series protagonist Aang's non-violent personality and his reluctance to kill Fire Lord Ozai. The finale also follows the exploits of many of Aang's friends and allies, including Sokka, Toph and Suki's struggle to destroy a Fire Nation airship armada, Zuko and Katara's battle against Zuko's sister Azula, and Iroh, King Bumi, and the Order of the White Lotus' attempt to reconquer .

"Sozin's Comet" received positive reception from critics and fans alike. The initial showing averaged 5.6 million viewers, a 195% increase in ratings compared with ratings from mid-July 2007. The premiere of episodes 52–61 (episodes 12–21 of throughout the week of "Sozin's Comet"'s release received over 19 million views, of which 5.6 million were from the premiere of "Sozin's Comet". At the 2008 Annie Awards, the director of the third part of "Sozin's Comet" (Episode 20 – "Sozin's Comet", Part 3: "Into the Inferno") won an award for "Best Directing in an Animated Television Production".

Aang suddenly abandons his Firebending lesson with Zuko to have a beach party with his friends, causing Zuko to attack him in his frustration. Aang explains he plans to challenge Fire Lord Ozai only after Sozin's Comet and its enhancement of Firebending have come and gone, due to his own self-perceived lack of Firebending skills at the moment. When Zuko tells the group Ozai plans to use the comet's power to burn down the Earth Kingdom, Aang resolves to face him before the comet arrives. The entire group advises Aang to kill Ozai, but Aang refuses to kill him due to his pacifistic nature and non-violent upbringing.

That night, Aang sleepwalks to a forest not to be found in the morning. After the group fails to locate him, Zuko takes them to June, a tracker who might be able to locate Aang, using his smell. Meanwhile, Fire Lord Ozai proclaims himself to be ruler of the world, under the title "Phoenix King", and declares Azula to be the new Fire Lord, setting off to burn the world and rebuild it under his New Order.

Zuko's tracker, June, is unable to locate Aang, but does find Zuko's uncle, Iroh. He and several other characters (Pakku, Jeong Jeong, King Bumi and Piandao) are part of an otherwise non-aligned group known as the "Order of the White Lotus", which plans to liberate the Earth Kingdom capital, Ba Sing Se, from Fire Nation rule. Zuko and Katara decide to fight Azula in the Fire Nation capital while Sokka, Toph, and Suki attempt to destroy the airship fleet of Ozai.

Meanwhile, Aang awakens on a floating island. Frustrated with his inability to find a way to defeat Ozai without killing him, he asks four of his past lives for advice. Unsatisfied with their answers, he asks the island for help. The island, which is actually a giant "lion-turtle", provides Aang with the power of energybending and leaves him on the Earth Kingdom shores.

The Comet appears in the sky, and Azula's coronation takes place. Azula banishes nearly all of her subjects (including her Dai Li agents) in fear of betrayal. Her paranoia and loneliness begin to drive her insane. Before she is crowned, Zuko and Katara arrive. Zuko accepts Azula's challenge of an Agni Kai, because he feels that something is wrong with Azula and he does not want Katara injured. Just as Zuko is on the verge of defeating Azula, she shoots a bolt of lightning at Katara instead of Zuko. Zuko intercepts the lightning, preventing Katara from getting hurt, but injures himself after he fails to correctly redirect the lightning.

Meanwhile, Sokka, Toph, and Suki hijack a Fire Nation airship, and use it to destroy many others, effectively stopping Ozai's plan of incinerating the Earth Kingdom. In Ba Sing Se, the Order of the White Lotus, led by Iroh, lay siege to the Fire Nation forces within the city, with the sole intention of re-conquering it in the name of the Earth Kingdom. Aang reappears and begins to duel the Fire Lord. However, when Aang successfully redirects lightning he purposely misses Ozai to avoid killing him. Because of his pacifism, Ozai begins to gain the advantage.

Zuko lies on the ground twitching as Katara and Azula fight. After several minutes of running, Katara freezes Azula and chains her to the ground. After doing it, Katara revives Zuko.

After a fierce battle, Ozai slams Aang into a rock inadvertently releasing his locked seventh chakra and enters the Avatar State. With the power of his past lives, Aang overwhelms Ozai. Although Ozai is subdued, Aang refuses to kill him; instead, he locks Ozai down with earth. He realizes what the lion-turtle had meant and uses Energybending to strip Ozai of his Firebending powers, ending his ability to wage war. Afterwards, Aang raises and lowers nearby water to undo the damages that the Fire Nation caused.

The Order of the White Lotus liberates Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King. During his coronation, Zuko promises to aid the world in the postwar reconstruction. Sometime after the ceremony, Zuko visits Ozai's prison and demands he tell him the location of the banished Ursa, Zuko's mother. A final scene depicts the main cast gathered in Iroh's new tea shop, the Jasmine Dragon. Aang and Katara kiss passionately upon the shop balcony as the series ends.

Co-creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko wrote the majority of the finale; DiMartino wrote parts one, three, and four, and Konietzko assisted with parts three and four. Aaron Ehasz, a frequent writer for the series, wrote part two. Ethan Spaulding directed part one (The Phoenix King), Giancarlo Volpe directed part two (The Old Masters), and Joaquim Dos Santos directed parts three and four (Into the Inferno + Avatar Aang). Dos Santos was nominated for an Annie Award for his directing of part three, "Into the Inferno". Although "Sozin's Comet" was originally written as a three-part story, the creators noticed that the length had grown beyond what they had predicted from the initial script. To avoid pacing issues, they split the final part in two, adding several scenes to fill the remaining time.

Although "Avatar" is not considered anime because of its American origin, Tasha Robinson of the SciFi Channel observed that ""Avatar" blurs the line between anime and (USA) domestic cartoons until it becomes irrelevant." An IGN reviewer commented that "Sozin's Comet" "had that classic anime-look that I've always loved to see when watching old anime movies. The story through the animation was perfectly done." The special's music was written and composed by "The Track Team", led by Jeremy Zuckerman. However, unlike past episodes, a music track produced by a live orchestra was used, rather than one in midi format.

During the San Diego Comic-con, it was announced that a reunion between Zuko and his mother, Ursa had been arranged, and made into a storyboard. However, it was dropped just before the finale was finished, as requested by show co-creator Michael Dante DiMartino. 

The cast of "Sozin's Comet" includes all of the key characters from . Protagonists Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Toph are voiced by Zach Tyler Eisen, Mae Whitman, Jack DeSena, and Jessie Flower respectively. Iroh is voiced by Greg Baldwin and Zuko is voiced by Dante Basco. Grey DeLisle and Mark Hamill voice the two antagonists, Azula and Fire Lord Ozai, respectively. The co-creators also lend their voices to two minor characters in the third part, "Into the Inferno".

"Avatar: The Last Airbender" borrows extensively from East Asian art to create its fictional universe. Four "bending" arts exist in the universe; they are based on different styles and variations of Chinese martial arts: Baguazhang for Airbending, Hung Gar and Southern Praying Mantis for Earthbending, Northern Shaolin for Firebending, and Tai Chi for Waterbending. Additionally, series borrows heavily from the Taoist concept of balance and order. The Avatar, an incarnation of a divine being, is supposed to maintain the world's order.

Nickelodeon originally broadcasted "Sozin's Comet" from 8:00 pm to 10:00 pm EST on 19 July 2008. Just ten days later, on 29 July, the "Book 3: Fire – Volume 4" DVD was released, which contained the four episodes as well as episodes 56 and 57 (episodes 16 & 17 of third season), audio commentary from the series' co-creators, cast, and crew, and a comic book.

"Sozin's Comet" received many positive critical reviews; Ed Liu of Toon Zone stated that it made "Avatar" "one of the finest animated television series ever made", and IGN stating that this "film" deserved an Academy Award. Toon Zone praised the skill of the animation directors in designing the sweeping movements of the battle scenes, as well as the slower scenes, "including one moving reconciliation and the quiet coda that ties off many of the remaining loose ends of the series". IGN reviewer Tory Ireland Mell wrote that she would "put it in the top ten films of all time". She also praised the artistic skill of the designers, stating that the "whole dark tone was gorgeous to look at", especially the "art of the Lion Turtle". She thought that "Sozin's Comet" lacked plot holes, as well as unnecessary plot devices, stating that the "story moved and kept us moving right along with it from beginning to end". She gave "Sozin's Comet" a 10 out of 10 "Masterful" rating.

"Sozin's Comet" has received its share of criticism as well. Reviewers commented about the difficulty in understanding the voice of a new character: the Lion Turtle. The Lion Turtle was designed by Bryan Konietzko and character designer Jae Woo Kim. Bryan Konietzko disliked how the Lion Turtle turned out; he felt that the art was not up to standards of the original design he had received. CraveOnline felt that because "the series was for children, the writers were at a loss of ideas to work around the murder angle," and the decision not to kill the Fire Lord introduced "so many convenient plot twists [that] set us up for a humongous deus ex machina that allows the Fire Lord to be thwarted without dying".

The premiere of "Sozin's Comet" averaged 5.6 million viewers, 195% more viewers than Nickelodeon had received in mid-July 2007. During the week of 14 July 2008, it ranked as the most-viewed program for the under-14 demographic. The premiere of episodes 52–61 (episodes 12–21 of third season) throughout the week of "Sozin's Comet"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release received a total of 19 million views, and "Avatar" reached Nielsen's list of Top 20 Cable Results for the week ending 20 June 2008 four times. It also appeared on iTunes' top ten list of best-selling television episodes during that same week. "Sozin's Comet"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s popularity affected online media as well; "Rise of the Phoenix King", a Nick.com online game based on "Sozin's Comet", generated almost 815,000 game plays within three days. A video game loosely based on the third season, "", was released on 13 October 2008.

Joaquim Dos Santos won the "Best Directing in an Animated Television Production" caption in the 2008 Annie Awards for his directing in "Into the Inferno". Additionally, music editor and composer Jeremy Zuckerman and the sound editing team were nominated a Golden Reel award for "Best Sound Editing in a Television Animation" for their work in "Avatar Aang".

The Xbox 360 version of the game is notorious among 360 gamers as the easiest game to earn 1000/1000 achievement points, which can be done in less than a minute.

The game is the sequel of "" series, which is about the war the Fire Nation started. As the Avatar, Aang has to master all four elements and stop the from destroying the Earth Kingdom, just as they did with the Air Nomads. Experience for first time in the Avatar games the bending of all four elements, playing as Aang, Sokka, Katara, Toph, Zuko, Iroh, Jet and even Appa and Momo. The game is based on the .

Unlike "", "Avatar: The Last Airbender - The Burning Earth" features a multiplayer mode. In each stage, two characters can explore the area. Animal allies, Momo and Appa, appear in special "dramatic air battles." Players can also use all four bending styles. Another feature is Aang's ability to go into the Avatar State and unleash its power on enemies.


Bosses in DS version



The Xbox 360 version of the game is derided as the easiest game to earn all achievements and Gamerscore among all titles released for the platform. The game features just five achievements, and all 1000 Gamerscore can be easily earned in just 59 seconds in the first level of the game. The publisher of the game was interviewed by MTV.com game blogger Tracey John, regarding the easiness of the achievements, and stated that they were simply created with kids in mind.

Laura Massey referred to the controversy while watching a trailer during Microsoft's Kinect reveal at E3 in 2010.

An Xbox 360 version is also available and was released on 31 October 2008 in the UK.

Gameplay styles vary on different platforms. In the Nintendo DS version, the characters have very large heads, giving the game a cartoonish, or chibi, feel. One of the DS screenshots show that Katara's ice bridge ability will return from the previous games. Sokka's boomerang is used to break hard to reach objects or to solve puzzles; it has been discovered (from the screenshots) that the player draws a path for the boomerang to follow. Toph can earthbend small platforms to get over gaps with spikes.

On the Wii version there's a totally new way to play. Fire, rocks and water can all be picked up by holidng the B button and are guided using the Wii remote provided there is a nearby source. Aang can form an "air ball" (sphere of high winds) to break down obstacles and blow away objects by making a circle with the Wii Remote. Toph can lift up Earth and throw it, pull earth out of walls and lift it up to make pillars. Katara can bend water to put out fires and can freeze it into a block by shaking the nunchuck. Ice can also be pulled out of water falls ice pillars can be made. Zuko can guide fire and burn things. Aang is unique, in that he can bend all four elements, although he only fights using Airbending. Sokka however throws his boomerang when the B button is pressed and uses the Wii remote to aim.

"Who Feels Love?" is a song by the rock band Oasis. It was written by the band's lead guitarist Noel Gallagher. It became the second single to be released from the album "Standing on the Shoulder of Giants". The song reached number 4 on the UK singles charts. The single was a success, but it failed to achieve a Silver or better certification in the UK. The previous 11 British Oasis singles had reached this level of certification.

The album was noted for its psychedelic feel, and "Who Feels Love?" was the best example of this. Mark Stent was praised for his production on the song, creating a "trippy" feel like that found on Beatles songs such as "Rain". With the psychedelic and Eastern sound, the song also reminds of George Harrison achievements like "Within You Without You" and also some of his solo work. 

However, despite the high-quality production, the song was not well received by the critics, "NME" said that the production "triumphs over any real sort of feeling... pure mock Maharishi spirituality that not even Liam can salvage from the realm of self-parody".

One of the B-sides is a cover of The Beatles' "Helter Skelter". It was played live during the Shoulders tour of 2000.

Terror birds

Terror birds, the family Phorusrhacidae, were large carnivorous flightless birds. They were the dominant predators in South America during the Cenozoic, from 62–2 million years ago. They were roughly 1–3 meters (3–10 feet) tall. 

"Titanis walleri", one of the larger species, is known from Texas and Florida in North America. This makes the phorusrhacids the only known example of large South American predators migrating north during the Great American Interchange. This took place after the volcanic Isthmus of Panama land bridge rose about three million years ago.

A recently discovered species, "Kelenken guillermoi" from Middle Miocene some 15 million years ago, discovered in Patagonia in 2006, had the largest bird skull yet found. The fossil has been described as being a , nearly intact skull. The beak is roughly long and curves in a hook shape that resembles an eagle's beak. Most species described as phorusrhacid were smaller, tall, but the new fossil belongs to a bird that probably stood about tall. The large terror birds were nimble and quick runners able to reach speeds of .

Simulations of a terror bird strike produced by the Discovery Channel using a pneumatic model have demonstrated the larger species could easily crush the skull of its prey and puncture through bone with its beak. They had a fearsome weapon, a beak which could be driven into prey with the force of a sledgehammer, and could at speed over long distances. The Phorusrhacids are colloquially known as "terror birds", as the larger species were apex predators during the Miocene.

Phorusrhacos

Phorusrhacos was a genus of giant predatory flightless birds which lived in Patagonia. The terror birds lived in woodlands and grasslands. Remains are known from several localities in the Santa Cruz Province, of Argentina.

"Phorusrhacos" stood around 2.5 meters (8 ft) tall and weighed approximately 130 kilograms (280 lbs). It was nicknamed the "Terror Bird" for obvious reasons: it was one of the largest carnivorous birds ever to have existed, along with "Titanis", "Kelenken" and "Brontornis". Its rudimentary wings had claws shaped like a meat hook for tackling prey, which was then killed with the massive beak. It ate small mammals and carrion. 

Its skull was up to sixty centimeters long, armed with a powerful, hook-tipped beak. The structure of the beak and the large claws on the toes show that this was a bird of prey. It raced over the grassy plateaus and hills of Patagonia, catching small reptiles and mammals leaving larger prey to its more massive relatives such as "Brontornis".

It was a large dromaeosaurid: the first and only individual specimen found is estimated at being 5 meters (17 feet) long. The name comes from Achilles, a famous ancient Greek warrior of the Trojan War. It refers to the large Achilles tendon needed to use the sickle claw on the foot, which was the major weapon of dromaeosaurids. The one species is named "A. giganticus" because it is much larger than other dromaeosaurids.

Future of the Earth

The future of the Earth will depend on many things, including increases in the brightness of the Sun, loss of heat energy from the Earth's core and change of the planet's orbit by the other things in the Solar System. The Milankovitch theory says the planet will continue to go into glaciation cycles because of the planet's difference in orbit from a perfect circle, the axis of the planet tilting, and pushing of the Earth's orbit. As part of the supercontinent cycle, plate tectonics may create a supercontinent within 250 million–350 million years. Some time in the next 1.5 billion–4.5 billion years, the axis's tilt may begin to change into bad versions, with changes in the axis's tilt of up to 90°.

One billion to two billion years in the future, the increase in solar radiation caused by the helium build-up at the core of the Sun will result in the loss of the oceans and the cessation of continental drift. Four billion years from now, the increase in the Earth's surface temperature will cause a bad greenhouse effect. By that point, most if not all the life on the Earth will be gone. The most likely fate of the planet is being destroyed by the Sun in about 7.5 billion years, after the star has entered the red giant phase and expanded to cross the planet's orbit.

Humans now play a top role in the biosphere, with the large amount of people in many of Earth's ecosystems. This has caused a widespread, ongoing extinction of other species known as the Holocene extinction. The Holocene extinction event is the result of habitat destruction, the large distribution of invasive species, hunting and climate change.

The energy generation of the Sun is based upon changing of hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the core region of the star.

When the Sun first became a main sequence star, it radiated only 70% of the current luminosity. The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, increasing by 1% every 110 million years. In three billion years the Sun is expected to be 33% more luminous. The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be limited in 4.8 billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the increase in luminosity reaches 121% of the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it will be into a red giant.

Avatar: The Last Airbender (video game)

Avatar: The Last Airbender (known as Avatar: The Legend of Aang in Europe) is a video game based on the for Game Boy Advance, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Wii, and Xbox. 

The game was a launch title for the Wii in Western territories (USA).

The "Avatar: The Last Airbender" video game allows the player to control one of four characters - Aang, Katara, Haru, or Sokka - in a single-player adventure. Each character uses his or her own fighting style. He or she can get new special powers through experience from defeating enemies. Many different items can help the player during battle (armor, chi, enchanted accessories, and healing potions). 

The console versions of the game were developed by THQ Studio Australia.


Aang, a 12-year-old boy, is the main hero of the story. He is the present Avatar (the spirit of the planet as a human). As the Avatar, Aang must master all four elements to bring peace to the world and stop the war, which started 100 years ago. Katara, Sokka and Haru helped him to do it. Many characters from the show appear on this game such as Prince Zuko. However, Zuko had a small part in the game, only appearing in cutscenes. King Bumi also appears in the fourth level.

While training in the North Pole, Aang and Katara hear reports of a waterbender, Hiryu, going missing, which they investigate. They arrive at the Water Tribe as a Fire Nation ship attacks, led by Prince Zuko. They are able to fend off the attackers, but Katara is captured during the battle. Aang and Sokka follow the ship, but are slowed by a Firebending machine.

They follow the ship to an Earth Kingdom port and they free Katara, who informs them of another prisoner named Lian the Maker, who is being forced to make machines for the Fire Nation. When they arrive at Lian’s cell, they find it empty, except for a map to an Earth Kingdom village.

They find the village under attack by machines. After fending off the machines, picking up Haru and being informed that one of his earthbending friends Yuan was kidnapped, they travel to the library of Omashu for clues to where the machines might originate from. The information from the library leads them to an uncharted island.

On the island, they find Lian, making more machines. She fears that Aang will not be able to master all four elements before Sozin’s comet arrives. Aang refused her help, seeing as how the machines were disrupting villages. Lian then voiced her contempt for him as she sends a machine to fight them to flee to the Air temple, attempting to destroy the Avatar statues. They stop Lian, but Katara, Sokka, and Haru are captured by another machine.

Aang pursues Lian and the machine to a fortress. After Aang rescues his friends, they find Zuko, also captured by a machine. Upon rescuing him, Zuko attacks the group, but he is knocked over. After that, Aang enter the Avatar State and killed Lian.

Dromornis

Dromornis is a genus of fossil flightless birds. It lived in Australia from the late Miocene to the early Pliocene. This means early humans never met this animal. 

"Dromornis" had a huge beak and jaw capable of great force. It did not have the typical beak and claws of a carnivore, and its life style is not certain. Though they looked like giant emus, the "Dromornis" are more closely related to geese. 

"Dromornis stirtoni" was three metres (10 feet) tall and weighed up to half a ton (500 kilos). It inhabited subtropical open woodland in Australia during the late Miocene. It may have been partly carnivorous. It was heavier than the Moa and taller than "Aepyornis". 

"D. stirtoni" had a long neck and stub-like wings, so it was flightless. Its legs were powerful, but it was not a fast runner. The bird's beak was large and immensely powerful, leading early researchers to believe that it was used to shear through tough plant stalks. However, others have argued that the size of the beak suggests that the bird was a carnivore. There were forests and a permanent water supply where the "Dromornis" birds lived, although the climate was unpredictable.

"Dromornis" are part of a family of giant birds called Dromornithidae that lived from 15 million years ago until less than 30,000 years ago. Australasia had started to separate from other continents as Gondwana started to break up in the Mesozoic era. 

Australia's last connection with Antarctica broke about 40 million years ago. Since then the animals of Australasia (Australia and New Guinea) evolved slowly in almost complete isolation from the animals of other continents, except for the occasional immigrant species from Asia.

Helen Beatrix Potter (28 July 1866 – 22 December 1943) was an English writer, illustrator, mycologist and conservationist. She is famous for writing children's books with animal characters such as "The Tale of Peter Rabbit".

Potter's family was quite rich. She was educated by governesses. She did not have many friends, but she had many pets, including Benjamin and Peter, two rabbits. She spent her holidays in Scotland and the Lake District. There, she began to learn to love nature, plants, and animals, which she carefully painted.

When she was around 30, Potter published "The Tale of Peter Rabbit". It was very popular. She also became engaged to her publisher Norman Warne. Her parents became angry and separated with her because of this. They did not like her to marry someone who was socially lower than her. However, Warne died before he and Potter could marry.

Potter began writing and illustrating children's books full time. She did not have to ask her parents for money anymore because she had money from her books. In time, she bought Hill Top Farm and more land. In her forties, she married William Heelis, a local solicitor. She also began raising sheep and became a farmer, though she continued writing. She published 23 books.

Potter died on 22 December 1943. Almost all of her money was left to the National Trust. Her books continue to sell well around the world, in many different languages.

<doc id="258587" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=258587" title="Gastornis">
Gastornis

Gastornis, formerly known as Diatryma, is an extinct genus of large flightless birds. They lived in the late Paleocene and early Eocene epochs of the Cenozoic. The first remains were discovered in the mid-19th century.

In the 1870s, the famous American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope discovered another, more complete set of fossils in North America, and named them "Diatryma".

The fossil remains of these birds have been found in western-central Europe (England, Belgium, France and Germany) as well as North America. Their life style is in dispute.

"Gastornis parisiensis" measured on average 1.75 metres (5.7 ft) tall, but large individuals grew up to 2 metres (6.6 ft) tall. "Gastornis" had a huge beak with a slightly hooked top, which suggests that it was carnivorous. "Gastornis" had large powerful legs, with large, taloned feet, which also were considered in support of the theory that it was a predator.

Although North American and Europe were separated by the end of the Cretaceous, there must have been a landbrige still in place somewhere. This is because the European and North American "Diatryma"s were so similar. Other bird and mammal genera also occur on both sides of the (present-day) North Atlantic in the Palaeocene and Eocene. This is evidence that Europe and North America were once connected by dry land in part of the early Cainozoic.

At its time, the environment where "Gastornis" lived had dense forest and a moist to dry subtropical or even tropical climate. North America and Europe were still rather close, and Greenland probably was covered with lush woodland and grassland. Only narrow straits of a few 100 km at most would have blocked landbound dispersal of the "Gastornis" ancestors. Land in North American was connected. Their European range was an archipelago, with the Alpsbuilding up, and high sea levels in the Paleocene and Eocene. Geographically, it was roughly similar to today's Indonesia.

"Gastornis" has been depicted as predatory. However, some doubt the bird was agile enough to catch fast-moving prey, and have doubts about the beak being right for carnivory. It may be that "Gastornis" was an ambush hunter, or used pack hunting techniques to pursue or ambush prey. If "Gastornis" was a predator, it would have needed some means of hunting prey through the dense forest.

Alternatively, they may have been mainly scavengers, omnivores or even herbivores. The large beak of "Gastornis" would have been suited for crushing seeds and tearing off vegetation. But it seems too strong for a purely vegetarian diet. Regardless of what these birds ate, the beak may have been used also for social display – its presence in all known fossils argues against a sexual display role. These contradicting hypotheses, which can't be separated by the evidence, make the paleobiology of "Gastornis" unclear.

Similar gigantic birds of the Cenozoic were the South American terror birds (phorusrhacids) and the Australian mihirungs ("Dromornis"). The former were certainly carnivorous, and the latter are suspected of being predators, too. On the other hand, ratites, the flightless giant birds of our time, feed on plants, small vertebrates, and invertebrates.
"Gastornis" were among the largest, if not "the" largest birds alive during the Paleogene. They had few natural enemies and serious competitors. If these huge birds were active hunters, they must have been important apex predators which dominated the forest ecosystems of North America and Europe until the middle Eocene. 

The mid-Eocene saw the rise of large creodont and mesonychid predators in Eurasia and North America. The appearance of these new predators coincides with the decline of "Gastornis" and its relatives. This was possibly due to an increased tendency of mammalian predators to hunt together in packs (especially in the hyaena-like creodonts). We know of no bird which weighed more than half a metric ton. Perhaps they could not evolve to larger sizes. If so, they could not compete by sheer bulk as mammals are often able to do.

In late Paleocene deposits of Spain and early Eocene deposits of France, shell fragments of huge eggs have turned up in Provence. These are presumably from "Gastornis". 

Some of these fragments were complete enough to reconstruct a size of 24 by 10 cm (about 9.5 by 4 inches) with shells 2.3–2.5 mm (0.09–0.1 in) thick. This is roughly half again as large as an ostrich egg, and very different in shape from the more rounded ratite eggs.

Lead(II) oxide

Lead(II) oxide, also known as plumbous oxide and litharge, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is PbO. It has lead in the +2 oxidation state. It also contains oxide ions. 

It is a yellow or red solid. When it is heated with charcoal it makes liquid lead metal. It is a crystalline solid. It is highly toxic since it has lead in it. It reacts with acids to make other lead(II) salts and bases to make plumbites. 

It can be made by heating lead strongly in air. It can be also made by heating lead carbonate or lead nitrate. 

It is made when lead is taken from its ores. The lead sulfide in galena is changed to lead(II) oxide, which is heated with charcoal to make liquid lead. It is used to make lead glass. It used to be used in lead paint.

Flightless birds

Flightless birds are birds which cannot fly. They rely on their ability to run or swim, and have evolved from their flying ancestors. There are about forty species living today, the best known being the ostrich, emu, cassowary, rhea, kiwi, and penguin. 

Two key differences between flying and flightless birds are the smaller wing bones of flightless birds and the absent (or greatly reduced) keel on their breastbone. The keel anchors muscles needed for wing movement. Flightless birds also have more feathers than flying birds. 

New Zealand has more species of flightless birds (including the kiwis, several species of penguins, and the takahe) than any other country. One reason is that until the arrival of humans a thousand years ago, there were no large land predators in New Zealand. The main predators of flightless birds were larger birds.

Some flightless varieties of island birds are closely related to flying varieties. This implies that flight is a significant biological cost. As soon as birds do not need to fly, there is selection against flight.

The smallest flightless bird is the Inaccessible Island Rail (length 12.5 cm, weight 34.7 g). The largest (both heaviest and tallest) living flightless bird, is the Ostrich (2.7 m, 156 kg), although some extinct birds grew to larger sizes.

Flightless birds are easy to take care of in captivity because they do not have to be caged. Ostriches were once farmed for their decorative feathers. Today they are raised for meat and for their skins, which are used to make leather.

There were also other families of flightless birds, such as the now extinct Phorusrhacidae, that evolved to be very powerful terrestrial predators.

The following are flightless birds during or after the Holocene period.

Peter Rabbit is a fictional animal character in many children's stories by Beatrix Potter. Peter was different from the traditional hero of that time. He is small, emotional, easily scared, and a not very wise animal. He first came out in "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" in 1902. After that, he came out in five more books between 1904 and 1912. Potter made a soft doll shaped like Peter Rabbit, and soon dishes and wallpaper showed pictures of him. He appears as a character in the 1971 ballet film, "The Tales of Beatrix Potter" and in the BBC series "The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends". He was inspired by Potter's pet rabbit, Peter Piper. In stories, he wears human clothes and walks standing up. His mother is Mrs. Josephine Rabbit, and he has three sisters, Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail. His popularity made Potter say in 1917, "All rabbits "are" called Peter now" – but she added "either Peter or Brer Rabbit."

Bouldering

Bouldering is a kind of rock climbing. It is climbing without rope and harness. It is climbing heights at which the climber does not usually suffer serious injuries in case of a drop. To protect from injuries there are usually special bouldering mats underneath the climber. It is usually practiced on large natural boulders and in climbing gyms.

Boulder routes are called "problems", because this style is like solving climbing-problems. The height of boulder problems is rarely higher than 3-5 meters. Otherwise the risk of injuries is too high. Often other climbers, who stand on the ground, spot the climbers to protect them from hitting the ground with the head or the spine. 

The equipment used by boulderers is not much. They use special climbing shoes, a bouldering mat, some brushes to clean the grips and sports tape.

Bouldering was invented in the late 19th century. It has been first documented in France, England and Switzerland. It has been practiced for a long time but in the 1930s and 1940s it was practiced for its own sake in Fontainebleau in France. 

Today many rock climbers are specialized boulderers and it is their favourite style of climbing.

The Tale of Peter Rabbit

The Tale of Peter Rabbit is a children's book written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter. It is about the adventures of disobedient, playful young Peter Rabbit as he is chased around the garden of Mr. McGregor. He escapes and goes back home to his mother. The story was written for five-year-old Noel Moore. He was the son of Annie Moore, who had been Potter's governess in 1893. It was corrected and privately printed by Potter in 1901 after several publishers refused to print the book. It was printed by Frederick Warne & Co. in 1902. The book was very successful. It was printed again many times. It has been translated into 36 languages. It sold 45 million copies, and became one of the most popular books of all time.

After it was printed, much merchandise for both children and adults with Peter Rabbit was produced. Toys, dishes, food, clothing, videos and other products showed pictures of Peter Rabbit. Potter was one of the first to begin such merchandise when she made a Peter Rabbit doll in 1903. After that, a Peter Rabbit board game was produced.

At that time, the traditional literary hero was usually a brave, clever, young white male. Yet Peter Rabbit, the hero of "The Tale of Peter Rabbit", was a disobedient little rabbit. Through him, Potter greatly changed the traditional "good child" of that time. Peter Rabbit came out as a character in a 1971 ballet film, and the tale has been used for a television series.

Peter Rabbit, his sisters Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail, and his mother are anthropomorphic rabbits. They dress in human clothing and usually walk standing up. However, like real rabbits, they live in a rabbit-hole under a fir-tree. Mother Rabbit told her children not to go into the garden of Mr. McGregor. This is because their father was made into a pie there. However, while Mrs. Rabbit is shopping and the girls are picking blackberries, Peter enters the garden. There, he eats so many vegetables he becomes sick. After that, Mr. McGregor tries to catch Peter. When Peter loses his jacket and his shoes, Mr. McGregor uses them to dress a scarecrow. Peter is almost caught by Mr. McGregor many times. When he finally escapes from Mr. McGregor, Peter goes back home to his mother. She puts him to bed and makes him drink camomile tea because he is tired and sick. However, his sisters (who have been good little rabbits) enjoy bread and milk and blackberries for dinner. In a 1904 sequel, "The Tale of Benjamin Bunny", Peter goes back to McGregor's garden to find his lost clothes.

In the 1890s, Potter sent illustrated story letters to the children of Annie Moore, who had used to be her governess. In 1900, Moore, who realized how popular Potter's stories could become, suggested they be made into books. Potter agreed. She took her letters (which had been carefully saved by the Moore children) and chose a letter written on 4 September 1893 to five-year-old Noel about a rabbit named Peter. Potter had owned a pet rabbit called Peter Piper. The letter was too short to be a proper book, so Potter made the story longer and added pictures in black and white. She copied the work into a hardcover book with a frontispiece picture of Mrs. Rabbit giving Peter camomile tea at the end of the book.

Potter's manuscript book had the title of "The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor's Garden". The manuscript was refused by six publishers. Even Frederick Warne & Co. refused to print it, even though it had shown interest in her artwork several years ago. Some publishers wanted a shorter story. Others wanted a longer one. Almost all the publishers wanted the pictures to be colored. Potter grew frustrated because her book continued to be refused. She had already planned what her book should look like. She wanted her book's style and size to be like "Little Black Sambo". She had also already thought of how much it should cost.

At last, she decided to publish the book herself. On 16 December 1901, the first 250 copies of her privately printed "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" were given out to her family and friends.

In 1901, a friend of Potter's family, Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley, changed Potter's story into a poem and tried giving his version, together with her illustrations and some of her corrected writing, to Frederick Warne & Co. The company refused Rawnsley's version, but they wanted to see Potter's complete manuscript. They hoped that "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" would be as successful as Helen Bannerman's greatly popular "Little Black Sambo" and other children's books that were being sold at that time. When Warne asked why there weren't any colors in the illustrations, though, Potter replied that rabbit-brown and green colors were not interesting. Warne said he would not publish the book, but he said he might publish other books she wrote later. 

Warne wanted color illustrations in "The Tale of Peter Rabbit", which he called the 'bunny book'. He also suggested that they only use 32 illustrations instead of the first 42 illustrations. At first, Potter did not want to color her illustrations, but she came to realize that not coloring her illustrations would be a bad idea. She sent Warne some new color illustrations with a copy of her privately printed edition. Warne then gave these two the famous picture book artist, L. Leslie Brooke, to see what he thought about the pictures. Brooke was delighted with Potter's work. At the same time, small picture books became very popular.

Potter continued showing privately printed copies to her family and friends. Soon the first private printing of 250 copies was sold out, and another 200 had to be prepared. She noted in one copy that her pet rabbit Peter had died on 26 January 1901. He had been nine years old.

Potter and Warne agreed to publish cheap 5,000 copies. The next year, an official contract was signed in June 1902. Potter worked hard in the process of publishing the story—she drew her pictures again when she needed to, made small changes to the writing, and corrected the punctuation. Even before it was published in early October 1902, the first 8,000 copies were sold. By the end of the year there were 28,000 copies in print. By the middle of 1903 there was a fifth printing, and in the same month, there was a sixth printing. A year after the first commercial publication there were 56,470 copies printed.

Warne's New York office did not register the copyright for "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" in the United States. Because of this, unlicensed copies of the book began to appear in the spring of 1903. Nothing could stop the printing of unlicensed copies.

This made Potter lose a great deal of money. She began to fully realize the need to license her books properly when, after she had successfully published "The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin", her father found a toy squirrel called "Nutkin" at the Burlington Arcade in Christmas 1903.

After "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" began to be sold, a great amount of merchandise copied its design and idea. Potter registered the patent for a Peter Rabbit doll on 28 December 1903. The next year, she designed a Peter Rabbit game. She made firm rules about making licensed merchandise such as dolls, books, tea sets, wallpapers, pencils and pens, cards, and other merchandise. Because the Peter Rabbit merchandise was so popular, Potter later said in 1917, "All rabbits "are" called Peter now". She did add for her American readers, though, "Peter or Brer Rabbit."

Many different versions of "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" and merchandise about it have been produced until now. There are now pop-up books, toy theaters, and lift-the-flap books. By 1988, there were even video versions of the story, computer programs, and Internet websites. Puppets, dolls, games, dishes, clocks and music boxes, baby and children's clothing, tea, jam, toothbrushes and soap, stickers, and even a cake about Peter Rabbit was sold in British supermarkets. Large toy shops in the United States and Britian have parts of the store where they only sell Potter-related toys and merchandise. Some shops only sell entirely Potter-related merchandise.

Other merchandise about Peter Rabbit is quite different from the first Peter Rabbit. In 1916, Louise A. Field became rich by writing books such as "'Peter Rabbit Goes to School" or "Peter Rabbit and His Ma". A movie by Golden Films, "The New Adventures of Peter Rabbit", gave Peter longer teeth and a fourth sister named Hopsy. This story had him and his city cousin Benny (probably Benjamin Bunny) following a box with his sisters inside it. Another video about the story showed Peter as a Christian preacher singing songs about God and Jesus with children and vegetables.

"The Tale of Peter Rabbit" is often praised because of its simple, rhythmic words.

But round the end of a cucumber frame,<br>
whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor! 

Linda Lear noted that Potter began a new kind of animal fable in "The Tale of Peter Rabbit". She had made one in which anthropomorphic animals look and act like real animals, with pictures that were drawn by a scientifically minded artist. She added that Peter Rabbit's personality has a lot of real "rabbity behaviour" inside it. She said that the tale was a "perfect marriage of word and image" and "a triumph of fantasy and fact".

Carole Scott, a literary scholar and critic, wrote in her essay “An Unusual Hero: Perspective and Point of View in "The Tale of Peter Rabbit"” (2002) that she thought Potter's story was about a naughty hero with a proper moral at the end. However, she remarked that Potter used many different ways to make the reader feel sympathetic for Peter. Though he made his mother unhappy by disobeying her, stole, escaped from authority (Mr. McGregor), and did not get any punishment except a stomach-ache, Potter makes us feel sorry for him. She thought the greatest conflict in the tale was between the order of society and the forces that tried to go against it—between those who have things and those who want things, and between humans and animal nature. She felt that Peter was a symbol of “rebellion”.

Two of Us (The Beatles song)

"Two of Us" is a song by The Beatles, written by Paul McCartney, although it is credited to Lennon/McCartney. Lennon and McCartney sang the song as a duet. It was written for Linda Eastman, McCartney's soon to be wife, though it sounds at times as if it is addressing Lennon, whose relationship with McCartney was tense at that time.

"Two of Us" was originally a hard rock song. In the "Let It Be" film, McCartney and Lennon sing the song "rocker" style into the same microphone. McCartney had never been satisfied with this style, which he said was "chunky." And so on 24 January, he and the band reworked it. Lennon had ideas about how the song might sound if Stevie Wonder performed it, and just before revisiting the song, the band had run through the Everly Brothers hit "Cathy's Clown". With these influences and a move from electric guitar to acoustic, the song transformed into the gentler, stripped-down version that fans know today. The Beatles performed a finished version of the song live at Apple Studios on 31 January 1969; this performance was included in both the "Let it Be" film and album.

The song was originally titled "On Our Way Home". In May 1969, McCartney produced a recording of the song using this title by the group Mortimer, a New York City trio that briefly recorded for Apple, but this recording was never released.

At the beginning of the recording Lennon shouts, "'I Dig a Pygmy', by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids... Phase One, in which Doris gets her oats!" The shout was mixed in by Phil Spector for the "Let It Be" album and also appeared in the "Let It Be" film, both released in 1970. "The deaf aids" was the nickname given to the Beatles' Vox amplifiers.

In his 1980 interview with "Playboy", Lennon claimed he wrote the song, but he may have been distracted at the time by a previous question about "Don't Let Me Down."

In fact, in his 1972 interview with the Hit Parader, Lennon said that Two of Us was written by McCartney.

Dig a Pony

"Dig a Pony" is a song by The Beatles.

John Lennon was the song's composer and singer but the song was credited to Lennon/McCartney. It was originally called "All I Want Is You". Lennon would later comment that he thought the song was "a piece of garbage," though he has shown similar scorn for many of his songs. It was written for his soon-to-be wife Yoko Ono, and featured a multitude of strange, seemingly nonsense phrases which were strung together, culminating in the chorus "All I want is you", aimed at Yoko.

The song was one of the songs on "Let It Be" that was recorded at the rooftop concert. It begins with a false start, with Ringo Starr yelling "hold it!" to halt the other band members because he was holding a cigarette and had only one drum stick in his hand.

Dame Joan Alston Sutherland, OM, AC, DBE (7 November 1926 – 10 October 2010) was an Australian operatic soprano particularly associated with the bel canto repertory and French operas. She possessed a voice of great beauty and considerable power combined with extraordinary agility and a brilliant upper register. She was called "La Stupenda" by the Italian press, which means "The Stupendous One". 

Born in Sydney, Australia, she studied first with her mother and later with John and Aida Dickens. After a few public appearances, notably in Henry Purcell's "Dido and Aenas" and Eugene Goossens' "Judith", she left for London, England in 1951 to continue her vocal studies with Clive Carey.

She was hired by the Royal Opera House as a utility soprano, making her debut in 1952, as the First Lady in Mozart's "The Magic Flute". She went on singing a wide variety of roles such as Amelia ("Un ballo in maschera"), Aida ("Aida"), Agathe ("Der Freischutz") and Eva ("Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg"), and also created the role of Jennifer in Michael Tippett's "The Midsummer Marriage" in 1955. 

She met and married fellow countryman and accompanist Richard Bonynge in 1954, who recognized her potential for the bel canto repertoire and guided her in that direction. This led to her appearance in Donizetti's "Emilia di Liverpool" and Handel's "Alcina" in 1957, and eventually the title role in "Lucia di Lammermoor" at the Royal Opera House in 1959, which proved a sensational success and launched her international career.

She was rapidly invited to appear at most of the great opera houses of the world (Milan, Paris, New York, etc.) to great acclaim. Some of her most famous roles include; Rossini's "Semiramide", Bellini's "La sonnambula", "Norma", "Beatrice di Tenda", "I puritani", Donizetti's "Lucrezia Borgia", "Maria Stuarda", Verdi's "La traviata", amongst many others. She also resurrected some long neglected works like Massenet's "Le Roi de Lahore" and "Esclarmonde".

Sutherland retired from the stage in 1990. She was made a Dame of the British Empire (DBE) in 1978. She died at her home near Montreux, Switzerland, at the age of 83.

Montserrat Caballé (born 12 April 1933) is a Spanish (Catalan) operatic soprano and one of the greatest opera singers of the 20th century. Although she sang a wide variety of roles, she was particularly associated with the bel canto repertoire in which she was considered one of the finest modern exponents. She possessed a voice of great range and remarkable beauty combined with impeccable musicianship and a flawless technique.

Born in Barcelona, Spain, she studied at the Music Conservatory of her native city and graduated in 1954 with a gold medal. She began her professional career in Basel in 1956, as Mimi in "La bohème". She then joined the Bremen Opera, where she sang from 1959 to 1962, in a wide variety of roles.

International recognition came in 1965, when she appeared in a concert performance of Donizetti's "Lucrezia Borgia" at Carnegie Hall in New York City, as a replacement of an indisposed Marilyn Horne. The performance won her great acclaim from public and critics alike and made her an overnight sensation. Her success led to her debut that same year at the Metropolitan Opera, as Marguerite in Gounod's "Faust". 

She has since then been invited to sing at most of the major opera houses and festivals of the world. She was especially admired in works by composers such as Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini and Verdi, and revived a number of long neglected works by these composers.

Maria Callas

Maria Callas (December 2, 1923 – September 16, 1977) was an American-born Greek soprano and one of the most famous and most controversial opera singers of the 20th century. She possessed a highly distinctive voice of great range and power and was one of the finest singing-actresses the operatic stage has ever known. She was dubbed "La Divina" ("The Divine One") by her admirers. She was mainly associated with the Italian repertoire, particularly Bellini's "Norma", Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor", Verdi's "La traviata" and Puccini's "Tosca". 

Born Maria Kalogeroupoulou in New York City, to Greek parents, she returned to Greece in 1937, with her mother and older sister. There, she studied singing with Elvira de Hidalgo, and made her debut while still a teenager with the Athens Opera in 1939.

During a short return to America to visit her father in 1945, she auditioned at the Metropolitan Opera without success. Her first major break came with her Italian debut in Verona in 1947, as "La Gioconda". There, she met conductor Tullio Serafin who became her mentor and guided her towards the bel canto repertoire. She sang her first "Norma" in Florence in 1948, and the following year, as a last minute replacement, she appeared as Elvira in Bellini's "I puritani" in Venice, which was to be her first great success. 

In 1949, she married industrialist Giovanni Battista Meneghini who became her manager. She was sometimes known as Maria Meneghini Callas after her marriage. 

Shortly after, she made her debut at La Scala in Milan, where the major part of her career and greatest triumphs were to take place. In collaboration with conductors like Carlo Maria Giulini, Leonard Bernstein, Gianandrea Gavazzeni, and directors like Franco Zeffirelli and Luchino Visconti, lavish productions of works such as Cherubini's "Medea", Spontini's "La Vestale", Bellini's "La sonnambula" and "Norma", Donizetti's "Anna Bolena" and "Poliuto", Verdi's "La traviata" and "Un ballo in maschera", were made especially for her to great acclaim. 

She also made guest appearances at the Royal Opera House in London, the Berlin State Opera, the Paris Opéra, the Lyric Chicago Opera, the Dallas Opera and the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. 

In 1958, she met Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis which led to her divorce from Meneghini, and slowly began to withdraw from the stage. Her final appearance was in "Tosca" in London in 1965. She made a last world concert tour in 1973–74 with her often partner tenor Giuseppe Di Stefano, but by then her voice was almost gone. 

Maria Callas died of a heart attack in Paris, France, at the age of 53.

Package management system

A package management system keeps track of information about software packages: what files go where, and which package owns that file, therefore behaving like a phone directory. Examples of package management systems for Linux include dpkg, rpm and emerge. In Microsoft Windows, "Add/Remove Programs"/"Programs and Features" are like package managers, but use no format (it leaves it up to the program).

Invasive species

An invasive species is a species which has moved from its native area, where it grew naturally, into a new area. Often it becomes a nuisance species, because in its new habitat it lacks its old enemies. Normally, as a species evolves, so do the things which eat it or parasitise it. Free of natural restraints, the invading species outcompetes its new neighbours.

Kudzu, for example, is called "The weed which ate the South" because it went out of control in the southern United States. The introduction of starlings to North America is another example.

Japanese Grand Prix

The Japanese Grand Prix is a race the FIA Formula One World Championship calendar. Usually, this race is one of the last races of the season. 

The Japanese Grand Prix has been hosted by both the Fuji Speedway and the Suzuka Circuit. Fuji Speedway is owned by Toyota and Suzuka Circuit is owned by their rival Honda. In July 2009, Toyota announced it would not host the race at Fuji Speedway in 2010 and beyond due to a downturn in the global economy.

The first Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix, in , was held at the Fuji Speedway, west of Yokohama. The race was to become famous for the battle between James Hunt and Niki Lauda for the championship. The race was held during monsoon rain conditions. Lauda had survived a near-fatal crash at the German Grand Prix earlier in the season. He withdrew from the Japanese Grand Prix fearing for his safety. Hunt finished third, and ended up winning championship by a margin of one point. 

Hunt returned to win the second Japanese Grand Prix. There was a collision between Gilles Villeneuve and Ronnie Peterson in the race. Villeneuve's Ferrari flew off the track and killed two spectators. The Japanese Grand Prix did not return to Formula One for another decade.

Formula One returned to Japan in 1987. This time, it was hosted by the Suzuka Circuit, south west of Nagoya. The circuit was set inside a amusement park, and owned by Honda. Honda used the circuit as a test track. The Suzuka circuit was the first figure-eight race track in F1. One section of the track passes over the other on a bridge.

The FIA announced on 24 March 24 2006 that future races will again be held at Fuji Speedway. Fuji had been redesigned by Hermann Tilke..

Formula One announced On 8 September 2007, that Fuji will alternate hosting the Japanese Grand Prix with Suzuka. This will start in 2009.

In July 2009, Toyota cited a global economic slump as the reason that the Japanese Grand Prix would not return to Fuji Speedway in 2010 and beyond. The speedway argued, according to the Associated Press, that "continuing to host F1 races could threaten the survival of the company." As a result, the 2010 Grand Prix will be held at Suzuka.

Avatar: The Legend of Korra

Avatar: The Legend of Korra is an upcoming animated series produced by Nickelodeon about Korra, a hotheaded independent girl and the Avatar after Aang. The series is set 70 years after the defeat of Firelord Ozai in the original series, and is created by Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. Korra is native to the water tribe, as water succeeds air in the avatar cycle. Korra already has mastered three elements, but has yet to master airbending. She will learn to bend air from Aang's son, Tenzin. Unlike the previous series, "Avatar: The Legend of Korra" is rooted in only one place called Republic City, a place where people of all nations, benders and non-benders, live together. The city has a lot of crime and is rattled by an anti-bender revolt, which serve as challenges for the characters in the show.

Korra - a hotheaded and independent girl. She has mastered water, earth, and fire, but has yet to master air at the beginning of the series.

Tenzin - Korra's airbending teacher and also the son of Aang and Katara, as revealed by the creators of Avatar.

"Avatar: Legend of Korra" takes place 70 years after "Avatar: The Last Airbender". Korra is the next Avatar after Aang, a rebellious girl who is hotheaded, independent and "ready to take on the world". Korra comes from the Southern Water Tribe, and has already mastered Earth, Fire, and Water. Aang and Katara's son Tenzin is her Airbending teacher.

One of the story's settings is Republic City, a "metropolis powered by steam-type technology", "inhabited by people from all four nations". Here Korra must deal with rampant crime and an anti-bender revolt. Mike and Bryan have said that the world of Avatar has "definitely changed, and evolved, and advanced, but we're very conscious of keeping the same feeling. Not totally different, but it's definitely generations later."

Impact craters are formed by meteorites or comets striking the Earth (or Moon, or planet). There is now a system for recording and assessing craters. 

The five largest "confirmed" impact structures are:
There are some other suggested impact structures which are larger. It is a feature of the Earth that climate, weathering and plate tectonics removes most of the older features and events. In comparison, the Moon retains a nearly complete record of its past impact events. The implication is that the Earth once suffered a similar bombardment in its early history. This period is known as the Late Heavy Bombardment, because it occurred after the Earth and Moon formed.

Any of these may or may not be meteorite craters:

The distinctive mark of an impact crater is the presence of rock which has undergone shock-metamorphic effects, shattered or melted rocks, and crystal deformations. Examples:

The lyrics follow the "letter song" model as used on "P.S. I Love You", the B-side of their first single.

Yas Marina Circuit

The Yas Marina Circuit is the venue for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The circuit was designed by Hermann Tilke. It is located on Yas Island, about 30 minutes from the capital of the UAE, Abu Dhabi. Yas Marina is the second Formula One track in the Middle East. The first was Bahrain. It also hosted the opening event for the Australian V8 Supercars series, the Yas V8 400, in February 2010.

Yas Marina was designed as an Arabian version of Monaco. The twenty-one corners twists through the man made island off the Abu Dhabi coast. The track passes by the marina and through the Yas Marina Hotel, and winds its way through sand dunes, with several long straights and tight corners. 

The circuit has four grandstand areas (Main Grandstand, West Grandstand, North Grandstand and South Grandstand). Part of its pit lane exit runs underneath the track. It has Media Center, Dragster Track, VIP Tower, Ferrari World Theme Park, and a team building behind the pit building. One of the gravel traps runs underneath the West grandstand. 


The circuit was built by Cebarco-WCT WLL, under contract from Aldar Properties. The circuit was constructed with a permanent lighting system provided by Musco Lighting, similar to that also installed at the Losail Circuit in Qatar. Yas Marina Circuit is the largest permanent sports venue lighting project in the world.

The surface of the track is made of Graywacke aggregate, shipped to Abu Dhabi from Bayston Hill quarry in Shropshire, England. The surface material is highly praised for the high level of grip. The same material was used at the Bahrain International Circuit .

On 7 October 2009, the circuit was granted final approval to hold Formula One races by the FIA. Bruno Senna was the first driver to complete a test run on the circuit.

After the first practice sessions at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the circuit was welcomed by the drivers, with Nico Rosberg commenting that every corner was 'unique'. World Champion Fernando Alonso stating that it was enjoyable because there was always something to do. Adrian Sutil rated the circuit as being better than Formula One's other night race in Singapore. He believes there is too much light at Marina Bay.

Not all of the drivers were complimentary. Giancarlo Fisichella does not like the pit exit, which dips under the main circuit by way of a tunnel. Fisichella claimed that it was both very difficult and dangerous.

Syncopation

Syncopation is music which creates rhythmical variation. Examples would be:

"If a part of the measure (bar) that is usually unstressed is accented, the rhythm is considered to be syncopated".

More simply, syncopation is a general term for a disturbance or interruption of the regular flow of rhythm; a placement of rhythmic stresses or accents where they wouldn't normally occur.

Syncopation is used in many musical styles, and is fundamental in black-influenced styles such as Cuban music, funk, ska, reggae, ragtime, rap, jump blues, progressive rock, extreme metal, jazz, breakbeat, drum'n'bass and dubstep. "All dance music makes use of [syncopation] and it's often a vital element that helps tie the whole track together". In the form of a back beat, syncopation is used in virtually all popular music.

Syncopation has been an important element of musical composition since at least the Middle Ages. For some musical styles, such as jazz and ragtime, syncopation is an essential part of their character.

Marina Bay Street Circuit

The Marina Bay Street Circuit (otherwise known as the Singapore Street Circuit) is a street circuit around the Marina Bay. It is the track for the Singapore Grand Prix. The track is 5.073 km (3.15 miles) long. It is next to the harbour, similar in style to the Monaco Grand Prix. 

The circuit is designed by KBR Inc. It was a modification of the original design first proposed by Hermann Tilke.

The pit area of the circuit is in an empty plot of land off Republic Boulevard. A temporary track leads from the pit area and under the Benjamin Sheares Bridge to Republic Boulevard and turns onto Raffles Boulevard. It then proceeds along Nicoll Highway, Stamford Road and Saint Andrew's Road around the Padang, and past the City Hall.

The track then goes onto the Anderson Bridge, past the Fullerton Hotel and make a tight left turn to Esplanade Drive beside the Merlion Park. It joins Raffles Avenue and cut right after the Esplanade to the front of The Float at Marina Bay and return to the pit area via another temporary road around the Singapore Flyer. The track layout is unique in that in between turns 18 and 19, the cars race underneath a section of grandstand of the Floating Platform.

The track was criticised by F1 drivers as being excessively bumpy. Lewis Hamilton commented that it was twice as hard to negotiate as the Monaco street circuit, and very physical - requiring twice the amount of energy over a single lap.

Other drivers, including Sébastien Bourdais and Fernando Alonso, expressed their concern about the high and harsh kerbs (curbs) at the turn 13 hairpin and the chicane at turn 10 of the street circuit. The drivers were worried that hitting the bumps could cause damage to the car. They were also worried that the bumps would force them into the wall on the outside of the corner. Responding to the drivers' feedback, FIA race director and safety delegate Charlie Whiting ordered the high kerbs at Singapore's turn 10 hairpin be modified. 

The entry of the pit lane was called "difficult and incredibly dangerous" by several drivers. They did not like the fast nature of the corners where the pit lane is. The pit entry was then modified before Saturday's official Qualifying round.

In March 2009, three of the circuit's corners were given names. Turn 1 was named "Sheares" after Benjamin Henry Sheares, the second president of Singapore. Turn 7 was named "Memorial" because it is near a Second World War civilian memorial. Turn 10 was named "Singapore Sling".

Holocene extinction

The Holocene extinction is the human-caused mass extinction of nearly all currently living species. habitat destruction and over-harvesting are two of the primary causes which drive species extinct. Only 15% of all life has ever been discovered, yet animal species are dying by the millions yearly. This is preventable if mass pollution and mass consumption of the rain forests comes to an end. Sustainable lumber harvesting practices Need to become the norm in countries such as Brazil, China and India.

The Holocene extinction event is one of the greatest dangers mankind faces today. If it is allowed to continue unhindered it will reach the "Omega Point" where all ecosystems on the planet will profoundly collapse, leaving the planet uninhabitable to humans and barren of vital resources like soil, fish and game animals for hundreds of millions of years.

If this does not become a global priority within the next twenty to thirty years, there is a real danger of reaching the Omega Point.

America's forests were almost entirely destroyed in around 200 years. A completely virgin continent of wilderness before the settlers arrived, now America's natural herds of bison which once number in the tens of millions have been reduced to a population of around 200,000. Bald Eagles have similarly suffered a 99% decline in their population since European settlers arrived.

The majority of our medicines come from exotic plants and animals, such as the horseshoe crab whose blue blood is used to test for impurities in new medical vaccines. Every insignificant seeming bird or insect we drive extinct yearly could have potentially contained a cure for cancer, conceivably even a key to greatly extending human life capacities or fundamentally improving the quality of life for people the world over.

Tsunami

A tsunami is a chain of fast moving waves in the ocean caused by powerful earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. 
Tsunami has a very long wave. It can be hundreds of kilometers long. Usually, tsunami starts suddenly. The waves travel at a great speed across an ocean with little energy loss. They can remove sand from beaches, destroy trees, toss and drag vehicles, damage houses and even destroy whole towns. 

The water will draw back from the coast half of the wave period prior to the wave getting to the coast. If the slope of the coast is not deep, the water may pull back for hundreds of metres. People who do not know of the danger will often remain at the shore. 

Tsunamis can not be prevented. However, there are ways to help stop people from dying from a tsunami. Some regions with lots of tsunamis may use warning systems which may warn the population before the big waves reach the land. Because an earthquake that caused the tsunami can be felt before the wave gets to the shore, people can be warned to go somewhere safe. 

The deadliest tsunami recorded was on December 26, 2004. It was caused by an earthquake. The earthquake was said to have a magnitude of 9.3 on the Moment magnitude scale. It was centered in the ocean near the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. Over 215,000 people died from this disaster. The giant wave moved very quickly. Hundreds of thousands of people in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, India, Somalia, and other nations, were killed or injured by it.

Tsunamis are often called "tidal waves". This is misleading, because tsunamis are not related to tides.

Suzuka Circuit

Suzuka International Racing Course, Suzuka Circuit for short, is a motorsport race track located in Ino, Suzuka City, Mie Prefecture, Japan and operated by Mobilityland Corporation, the subsidiary of Honda Motor Co., Ltd.. 

Designed as a Honda test track in 1962 by John Hugenholtz, Suzuka is one of few circuits in the world to have a figure 8 layout. The track doesn't actually intersect with itself. The back straight passes over the front section by means of an bridge.

The circuit can be used in three configurations. The full circuit, the "Suzuka East" and "Suzuka West" configuration. The "East" course is made of of the pit straight to the first half of the Dunlop curve (turn 7). It then leads back to the pit straight via a tight right hand turn. The "West" course is made up of the other part of the full circuit, with the pit stop located at the straight before the 130R corner.

Suzuka is one of the oldest remaining tracks of the Formula One World Championship. It has a long history of races as host of the Japanese Grand Prix. Suzuka was dropped from the Formula One calendar for the and seasons in favor of the Toyota-owned Fuji Speedway. Fuji had just been remodeled and the circuit redesigned by Hermann Tilke. Suzuka and Fuji were to alternate hosting the Japanese Grand Prix starting in . In July 2009, Fuji announced that it would no longer be part of the F1 calendar. Suzuka signed a deal to host the Japanese Grand Prix through .

The circuit closed for a year to make renovations. They needed to make the track comply with Formula One requirements for 2009. The last major event held on 18 November 2007. The track held a re-opening day on 12 April 2009.
Suzuka also hosts other motorsport events including the Suzuka 1000 km endurance race. The Suzuka 1000 km is a round of the Super GT series, and is the only race in that series of that length. Suzuka also hosts the Suzuka 8 Hours for motorcycles, which has been run since 1978. 

NASCAR organized the NASCAR Thunder 100, a pair of exhibition 100-lap races on the East Circuit. The races were held in 1996 and 1997. The layout which using the pit straight and S-corners, before rejoining the main circuit near the Casio Triangle. The cars were from the Sprint Cup Series (then called Winston Cup) and Camping World West Series (then called Winston West). The field was by invitation for the two races, and the field included several Japanese and Australian drivers. The 1996 event was marred by tragedy when pace car driver Elmo Langley died of a heart attack during practice. During qualifying for the 1997 race, rain caused Goodyear to use rain tyres on the Sprint Cup cars. This was the first time in NASCAR's modern era (which started in 1972) that race cars used rain tyres.

It was announced on 21 June 2010 that Suzuka Circuit would host the Japan round of the 2011 World Touring Car Championship season instead of the Okayama International Circuit.

Following two bad accidents in 2002 and 2003, safety has been a concern at the circuit's 130R corner. 130R is a radius turn starting past the Crossover. 130R has been compared to Spa's Eau Rouge. In 2002, Toyota driver Allan McNish suffered a high-speed crash through the bump. The crash sent him through a metal fence. He was not seriously injured.

Track officials redesigned the corner. They made it a double-apex (two smaller turns in one corner) section. One apex had a radius, and the second had a radius. This lead to a much closer Casio Triangle (chicane), with the chicane becoming a "bus stop" type for motorcycles.

Problems continued for the revised section. During the 2003 MotoGP Grand Prix of Japan, the track's first major event since the revisions, MotoGP rider Daijiro Kato was killed when he crashed in the new section, on his way to the braking zone for the Casio Triangle. MotoGP has not returned to Suzuka since the incident.

Along with Fuji Speedway, Suzuka Circuit has been featured many video and arcade games. The circuit appears in most F1 games that have been published since 1987. The East Course was featured in "NASCAR 98".

Santa Fe de Antioquia

Santa Fe de Antioquia is a municipality in the Antioquia Department of Colombia. The city is located about 50 miles north of "Medellin", the department capital. It has a population of about 23,000 residents. 

It was founded by the name "Villa de Santafé" in 1541 by Jorge Robledo on the western bank of the Cauca River. It received the coat of arms and the title of "City of Antioquia" from King Philip II of Spain in 1545. It was promoted to the status of parish in 1547 by the bishop of Popayán. It changed its name in 1584 when it became the capital of Antioquia. It was a mining town from its beginnings and the gold mining operation has been the base of its economy. 

Its cathedral was constructed in 1799 and elevated to Diocese of Antioquia in 1804 by Pope Pius VII. In 1813 Antioquia was declared a sovereign and independent state with Santa Fe as its capital, a status it maintained until 1826, when Medellín was chosen as the new departmental seat. Due to the state of conservation of its colonial architecture, it was declared a national monument in 1960.

The municipal area has a mountainous territory within the Central Cordillera of the Andes and watered by the rivers Cauca and Tonusco. Its area is 493 km².

The economy of "Santa Fe de Antioquia" is based on agriculture. The main products made are coffee, maize and beans.

Tourism was, and continues to be one of the more important economic enterprises for the municipality. The opening of the "Tunnel of the West" (which shortens the time and the distance between the locality and Medellín) in 2006 has allowed hundreds of tourists to come each weekend, stimulating the vocation of the vicinity as a summer vacation site.

All of the town is a historical site; the architecture that has survived through the years gives "Santa Fe de Antioquia" the aspect of a city "suspended" in the colonial era, which is the reason the city was declared a National monument.

Superstar is a 1999 comedy movie and "Saturday Night Live" spin-off about a quirky, socially incompetent girl called Mary Katherine Gallagher. The character was created by the "SNL" star, Molly Shannon and appeared as a recurring character on "SNL" in many skits. The story tells about Mary Katherine trying to find her place in her Catholic high school. The movie was directed by a former "Kids in the Hall" member, Bruce McCulloch.

The movie stars the following people:

"SNL" and "Kids in the Hall" alum, Mark McKinney, who appeared in many of the Mary Katherine Gallagher "SNL" skits on television, also has a minor role as a priest.

Molly Shannon got a nomination for Blockbuster Entertainment Award "Favorite Actress - Comedy", but lost to Heather Graham in "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me".

Mary Katherine Gallagher (Shannon) is an Irish-American Catholic school girl and social outcast in a Catholic high school. She wants to be a superstar, as she wants to get a kiss from Sky Corrigan (Ferrell). When Mary is sent to Special Education, she makes a new best friend, the tomboyish and equally socially-awkward Helen Lewengrub (Emmy Laybourne).

Mary sees her chance to become a superstar when her school promotes a talent show. She wants to try out, but Grandma Gallagher (Glynis Johns), didn't want her to. Mary tries out anyway, and when she goes to sign up, a stereotypical cheerleader, Evian Carrie Graham (Elaine Hendrix), gets into a fight with her. The fight causes Evian and Sky to break up, and now Sky is a "single hunk of beefcake on the rebound". Mary is now determined to get in the talent show so Sky will notice her. When Grandma Gallagher finds out that her granddaughter got into the talent show, she finally tells the truth about how her parents died - they were stomped to death while performing in a Riverdance-like competition. That is why Grandma Gallagher was against her granddaughter performing.

However, Grandma Gallagher decides to help Mary do her act in the talent show, as long as she performs for herself. Mary and the other Special Education students spent days practicing. Mary wins the competition as well as Sky's heart. When she kisses Sky though, she discovers he is a horrible kisser and chooses to kiss her friend Slater (Harland Williams) instead.

<doc id="259259" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=259259" title="Ampthill">
Ampthill

Ampthill is a small town in Bedfordshire, England, between Bedford and Luton. About 6000 people live in the town. A regular market has taken place on Thursdays for more than 700 years.
The name 'Ampthill' comes from an Anglo-Saxon word, 'Aemethyll', which means either 'ant-heap' or 'ant infested hill'. In the Domesday Book, Ampthill is called 'Ammetelle', with the landholder in 1086 being Nigel de la Vast. 

In 1242, King Henry III gave Ampthill the right to hold a market on Thursdays. The Thursday markets are still held.

Henry VIII was often visited Ampthill Castle. Katherine of Aragon lived at the castle from 1531 until she was divorced in 1533, when she was moved to Kimbolton. The castle was built in the 15th century by Sir John Cornwall, later Lord Fanhope. He used money he had made from ransoms after the Battle of Agincourt. The castle is now gone but there are some interesting parts of castle life still in existence. This includes ponds, such as West Minster Pond, made to hold and grow fish for food for the castle.

Houghton House was built in 1621 by Mary, Countess of Pembroke and brother of the poet Sir Philip Sidney. In 1675, the house gave John Bunyan the idea for the 'House Beautiful' in his book "The Pilgrim's Progress". Bunyan's book is based on his own journey between Bedford and Luton. The steep slope leading into Ampthill was the model for the 'Hill of Difficulty'. Houghton House passed to the Duke of Bedford in 1738 and became a ruin after the roof was taken off in 1794.

List of Avatar: The Last Airbender characters

The list of characters:

Aang (Zach Tyler Eisen) is the 12-year-old protagonist of the series who had been frozen in ice with his flying bison, Appa, for 100 years. He was find by a young Waterbender named Katara who later becomes his love interest. He is the current incarnation of the Avatar, the master of 4 elements. Aang is a reluctant hero trying to return balance to the world.

Katara (Mae Whitman) is a 14-year-old Waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe. Katara and her brother, Sokka, discover and free Aang from a block of ice in which he had been frozen for 100 years. With her brother Sokka, she accompanies Aang on his quest to defeat the Fire Lord Ozai and, eventually, becomes his Waterbending teacher. Katara is also one of the only Waterbenders that have the ability to Bloodbend, which allows her to control any person by bending the water inside the blood; although she is reluctant to use the ability. In the original un-aired pilot episode, Katara's name was Kaya; this later is stated to be her mother's name.

Sokka (Jack DeSena) is a 15-year-old warrior of the Southern Water Tribe. With his sister, Katara, he accompanies Aang on his quest to defeat the Fire Lord. As both the joker and the idea man of the group, Sokka describes himself as "meat-loving" and "sarcastic". Unlike his companions, Sokka does not have any bending ability; however the series, though it often makes him the victim of comedy at his expense, frequently grants him opportunities to use his ingenuity and weapons, including his trusty boomerang and a sword he forged from a meteorite. From creator Michael Dante DiMartino it was revealed that Sokka also had some waterbending potential, but never realized it.

Toph (Jessie Flower) is a 12-year-old blind, member of the rich family of Bei Fong, tough Earthbender who first appears in the second season of the show. Not long after meeting Aang and his friends, she leaves her wealthy family and comfortable home to join Aang on his quest and a plan to teach him Earthbending. Though blind, Toph "sees" by feeling vibrations in the ground through her feet. She is the only Earthbender to learn to bend metal and is considered one of the most powerful Earthbenders.

Zuko (Dante Basco) is the 16-year-old exiled prince of the Fire Nation and original antagonist of the series, including the end of the . Due to events in Zuko's past, his father Fire Lord Ozai, deems him a complete failure, and Zuko feels he must capture the Avatar to regain his honor. Over time, Zuko struggles to deal with his anger, self-pity, and complex familial relationships. Over the course of the series he grows sympathetic to the people his nation has terrorized. He takes on the identity of "the blue spirit" at the end of season one and beginning of season two. In season three, he defects from the Fire Nation and joins the Avatar and the team in order to teach Aang Firebending. At the end of the series, he is crowned ruler of the Fire Nation.

Azula (Grey DeLisle) is the manipulative princess of the Fire Nation. She is Zuko's younger sister and one of the major antagonists of the series. Azula is a Firebending prodigy and is one of the few living Firebenders capable of casting lightning. She uses fear to control her relatives or friends Mai and Ty Lee, reserving her family loyalty for her father alone.

Iroh (Mako in season one and two. Greg Baldwin in season three) is a retired Fire Nation general, known as the Dragon of the West, and Prince Zuko's uncle and mentor. Iroh was the original heir to the Fire Nation throne until his brother usurped the throne after Fire Lord Azulon's death. On the surface, Iroh is a cheerful, kind, optimistically eccentric tea-loving old man, but he still remains a powerful warrior and a devoted surrogate parent to Zuko. Iroh is a Grand Master of the Order of the White Lotus, a secret society of men from all nations and helps retake Ba Sing Se during the series finale. Unlike most Firebenders, Iroh does not use anger as the source of his strength; instead he uses the original Firebending skills learned from the Dragons.

The characters of "Avatar: The Last Airbender" were designed by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, the co-creators of the series. The anime-styled character art based on Shinichiro Watanabe's "Cowboy Bebop", "Samurai Champloo", and "FLCL" ("Fooly Cooly") of Gainax. The original character conception was derived from a sketch by Bryan Konietzko that depicted a middle-aged balding man with an arrow on his head. Studios such as Studio 4°C, Production I.G, and Studio Ghibli, which produced anime-styled cartoons, were also sources of inspiration.

The greatest influences on the series were Asian art and history; the characters' various personalities and traits are based on philosophical teachings such as Taoism and Buddhism. In the show, some characters have the ability to manipulate one of the four classic elements of ancient philosophy: Water, Earth, Fire and Air, although the Avatar has the ability to control all four. Each of these employ a different form of martial arts in their fighting choreography: Ba Gua for Airbending, Hung Gar for Earthbending, Northern Shaolin for Firebending, and Tai Chi for Waterbending.<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml"></ref> These individual styles of martial arts also reflect on the personalities of the user and the nations as a whole. These starkly individual tendencies are explained in eighty-five distinct types of "Jings", or internal energy. For example, Ba Gua employs the "negative jing" to create erratic circular movements and capitalizes on centripetal force and defensive positions while Northern Shaolin follows the "positive jing" and emphasizes brute strength and aggression to generate power. The negative jing reflects Aang's bending styles and his tendency to be unpredictable and extremely carefree, as well as his pacifist and non-aggressive nature.

Many of the recurring characters of the series have received more depth in their personalities, which are usually based on their respective element. Aang, a pacifist monk, is also very carefree and child-like, which is commonly attributed to the "freedom" of the wind and the air. Toph, despite being blind, is extremely perceptive of the world around her due to her connection to the Earth. Unlike Aang, she is extremely brusque when criticizing others, which is attributed to Earth's tough and unbreakable nature.

The characters of "Avatar: The Last Airbender" received both praise and criticism from reviewers. Troy Island Mell, of IGN, felt that the story "would [not] be anywhere near as good as it is without its ability to create such strong characters". In particular, Mell enjoyed the development of Katara and Zuko throughout the first season, but thought that Zuko's relationship with his uncle was not "very organic." Jamie S. Rich of DVD Talk generally agreed with Mell's assessment of the characters. Rich also praised the fact that, unlike many cartoon television series, "Avatar" introduces antagonists that have a deep backstory and "are [not] just evil for the sake of it".

Jeremy Mullin, another IGN reviewer, disagreed with Mell and Rich; he felt that the characters were not brilliantly done, though he noted that they introduced some drama and romantic tension usually not found on Nickelodeon, especially between Aang and Katara. Lair of the Green Knight and DVD Verdict also enjoyed the romantic tension, focusing mainly on the female cast: Katara, Toph, and Azula, as well as the two minor characters, Mai and Ty Lee. Fitz at Lair of the Green Knight lauded the decision to not stereotypically fashion the woman into the "usual weak female characters" but to instead give them "strong opinions and strength". IGN also compared character relationships, complimenting "Sokka and Princess Yue's forbidden love" while criticizing Iroh and Zuko's relationship as not being executed properly. DVDVerdict felt that some minor characters, especially Mai and Ty Lee, were "love em' or hate em'" characters. Gabriel Powers of DVDActive thought that while the characters fit into neat "archetypes", it was not a bad thing and fit well with the series.

In 2008, "Avatar" was awarded a Peabody for its "unusually complex characters". This makes the cartoon one of few animations to win the award and the only one to be cited for its character development.

<doc id="259267" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=259267" title="Ozai">
Ozai

Ozai also known as Fire Lord Ozai or the Phoenix King is a fictional character and the main antagonist in Nickelodeon's animated series "". Though one shown more behind the scenes than recurringly, he is nevertheless an important character in the series as he is the father of Azula and Zuko. He is also the younger brother of Iroh and is the rival of the main protagonist of the series, Avatar Aang who must stop Ozai to bring balance to the world. He is also Fire Lord Sozin's grandson. He is voiced by Mark Hamill.

Ozai first appears in the episode "Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku" in a vision where Avatar Roku explains to Aang that Ozai plans to use Sozin's Comet to increase his firebending ability. In the episode "The Storm" he is shown in a flashback of a story being told by Iroh explaining why Zuko is obsessed with capturing the Avatar. Zuko is challenged to a duel by Ozai and when Zuko refuses to fight, Ozai burns his son's face and banishes him. Zuko now tries to capture the Avatar to restore his honor and please his father. At the conclusion of the season 1 finale, "The Siege of the North, Part 2", Ozai sees Zuko as a failure and believes Iroh is now a traitor to the Fire Nation. Just before the episode ends, he is seen giving a task to Azula, though the details of this task are not revealed until season 2.

In the episode "Zuko Alone" his origin is shown in a flashback from back when his father Azulon was Fire Lord. After Iroh's son dies from the war in Ba Sing Se, Ozai claims that he should inherit the throne instead of his older brother, stating that because Iroh no longer has a son, the bloodline of Fire Lords would end with him. Azulon, infuriated at the request, orders Ozai to kill his own son, Zuko, to understand the pain that Iroh felt. Ozai's wife, Ursa, knowing that Ozai would do anything for the throne, offered Ozai a plan to spare Zuko's life and his place to the throne. This resulted the death of Fire Lord Azulon and the banishment of Ursa, though the latter is not revealed until season 3.

Ozai makes his first full appearance in the first episode of season 3, "The Awakening", after the Earth city of Ba Sing Se is conquered by Azula and the Fire Nation. Ozai now welcomes his son, Zuko, home after Azula states that he killed the Avatar. While in a war meeting, Zuko states that even though the Earth Kingdom is conquered that they would still not officially give up. Ozai concludes that the only way to defeat their resistance is to use the power of Sozin's Comet to increase the Fire Nation's power. When it becomes known that the resistance plans to invade the Fire Nation during the eclipse, Ozai evacuates the capital city and hides underground. There he comes face to face with his son, Zuko, who finally stands up to him saying he did not kill the Avatar and he's through trying to earn his love. Zuko states that what Ozai is doing is wrong, that the Fire Nation should live in peace and kindness with the other nations instead of spreading fear across the world. Ozai merely laughs at this. Zuko then admits he will free his Uncle Iroh and help the Avatar stop him. Ozai then provokes Zuko to kill him but Zuko refuses, saying it's the Avatar's destiny to stop him not his. When Zuko starts to walk away, Ozai distracts him by revealing what happened to his mother. When the eclipse ends, Ozai bends lightning straight at Zuko, but Zuko simply redirects it. 

When Sozin's Comet arrives he dubs himself the Phoenix King and declares that he is the ruler of the world. He also appoints his daughter Azula to the rank of Fire Lord. While attacking the Earth Kingdom, he is confronted by Avatar Aang. Because of his enhanced power and Aang's refusal to kill Ozai, he originally has the advantage. He is eventually defeated when Aang enters the Avatar state and strips Ozai of his Firebending ability by Energybending. After the defeat Team Avatar taunts him and calls him names, stating that he's not so tough now without his power. He is then imprisoned in the Fire Nation prison where Zuko visits him, stating that maybe prison will set him up in the right path, then demands to know where his mother is.

Ozai is revealed to be a cruel leader. He is easily angered and merciless. His cruel personality could be due to his failure in his relationship with his father, Azulon, who always favored his older brother, Iroh, over him. Ozai would prove to be a heartless father to his own son, Zuko, believing him a failure and even burning his face and banishing him. He even banished his own wife, though admitted later that he felt banishment was too light a punishment. He along with his daughter has a lust for power. He favors his daughter over Zuko, seeing her as a firebending prodigy. The expectations Ozai had for Azula caused her to become stressed and paranoid, eventually leading to her mental breakdown at the end of the series.

Ozai is an extremely skilled and powerful firebender, able to hold his own at the height of his powers due to Sozin's Comet against Aang despite Aang's status as a full-fledged Avatar. He is one of the few who can generate lightning along with Azula and Iroh, though he is shown to be the only one to shoot lightning out of both hands. With his firebending ability he is able to propel himself in the air similar to a jet. When Sozin's Comet arrives his firebending ability increases even more. After confronting the Avatar, Ozai's powers are taken away by Aang's Energybending.

He appears as an antagonist in the video game "". 

Fire Lord Ozai appears in the live action feature film in "The Last Airbender" played by Cliff Curtis. Unlike the series, Ozai is a regular character in the film.

Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit

The Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit is a street circuit around Albert Park Lake, only a couple of kilometres south of central Melbourne. It is used once a year as a racetrack for the Australian Grand Prix and associated support races.

The circuit uses everyday sections of road that circle Albert Park Lake, a small man-made lake just south of the Central Business District of Melbourne. The roads that are used were rebuilt prior to the first race in 1996 to ensure consistency and smoothness. As a result, the Albert Park track has quite a smooth surface. 

The course is considered to be quite fast and relatively easy to drive. Drivers have commented that the consistent placement of corners allows them to easily learn the circuit and achieve competitive times. The flat terrain around the lake, coupled with a track design that features few true straights, means that it is not easy to pass another car on the track. Watching the entire race track can only be done from a grandstand seat.

Each year, most of the trackside fencing, pedestrian overpasses, grandstands and other motorsport infrastructure must be erected for the race. This is done about one month before the Grand Prix weekend. They are all removed by six weeks after the event. Land around the circuit has restricted access during the grand prix weekend. This includes an aquatic centre, a golf course, a football stadium, some restaurants and rowing boathouses. Many nearby local residents are unhappy with the loss of park access. Some maintain a silent protest against the event. The event is popular with most people in Melbourne and Australia. They have a large European population and a general interest in motorsport. Middle Park (stadium), the home of South Melbourne FC was demolished in 1994 due to expansion at Albert Park.

Albert Park has the distinction of being the only venue to hold the Australian Grand Prix in both World Championship and non-World Championship formats. Prior to the Grand Prix, a modified version of the current circuit was used for both the 1953 and 1956 Grands Prix. During this time Albert Park ran anti-clockwise as opposed to the current GP circuit standard clockwise.

Autódromo José Carlos Pace

Autódromo José Carlos Pace, also known by its former name Interlagos, is a motor racing circuit located in the city of São Paulo, and named after Carlos Pace. Pace was a Brazilian Formula One driver, who had died in 1977. The track was renamed in his honor. It is well known for being the venue of the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix.

The land on which the circuit is built was originally bought in 1926 by property developers. They wanted to build a large suburban development.
Following financial difficulties, partly due to the 1929 stock market crash, it was decided to built a racing circuit instead. Construction started in 1938 and the track was opened in May 1940.

The traditional name of the circuit, Interlagos, literally means "between lakes". It comes from the fact that it was built between two large artificial lakes, Guarapiranga and Billings. They were built in the early 20th century to supply the city with water and electric power. It was renamed in 1985 to its current name to honor the Brazilian Formula One driver José Carlos Pace, who died in a plane crash in 1977.

The facilities include a kart circuit named after Ayrton Senna.
The circuit is one of the few non-oval racing circuits to go in an anti-clockwise (counter-clockwise) direction. The present design of the track dates back to 1990. The FIA had placed new restrictions on track length. The original circuit was shortened from 7.829 km to only 4.397 km. The track lost three long straight sections and three fast curves. The direction on another curve was reversed and a new curve created. The original track had many fast corners that allowed cars to keep maximum speed for up to twenty seconds. This was considered very dangerous. The new track still has a very long high-speed section. That section contains bumps, high-speed turns and little run-off area, but the track is very wide at this point.

Another feature that makes Interlagos interesting is that it follows the ups and downs of hilly ground. This makes the circuit harder to drive and more demanding on the car's engine. The hilly course is also a good feature for cycling races held in the circuit.

The circuit is known for its bumpy surface. This can cause damage on an F1 car, which has a very low ride height. The races are also physically tough on the drivers. With more right turns, the drivers' necks are forced to move to the left. Since drivers turn left more often, the other side of their neck is usually stronger.

For the Brazilian Grand Prix, major repairs were made to the circuit. They were the largest set of repairs made in the last 35 years. The repairs were to fix the problems with the track surface. The existing asphalt surface was entirely replaced, resulting in a much smoother track surface. At the same time, the pit lane entrance was improve for safety. A new grand stand was built. For the work to be done, the circuit was closed. No events were held in the five months immediately preceding the race.

On 17 October 2007, Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM) opened a new station of the Line C, "Autódromo", near the racing circuit. The Line C had been extended to improve the access between the center of São Paulo and southern area of the Greater São Paulo including the circuit. This improved access to the circuit.

The race start is in front of the "Tribunas" section and features a long straight section. Next comes "S do Senna" (Senna's S), a series of left, right, and left turns.

"S do Senna" connects with "Curva do Sol" (Sun Turn), a large-radius left-turn that leads to "Reta Oposta" (Opposite Straight). This refers to the unused back straight of the pre-1990 circuit. Next are two left hand, downhill turns that are called "Descida do Lago" (Lake Descent) and "Mergulho" (Dive). Then there is a short straight section that goes downhill.

After "Mergulho" comes a slow and difficult section, with tight turns and elevation changes. These turns are "Ferradura" (Horseshoe), "Laranjinha" (Orange Turn), "Pinheirinho" (Small Pine Tree), "Bico de Pato" (Duck Bill), and then two left hand turns called "Junção" (Junction).

After "Junção" there is a long, high-speed section. The is "Subida dos Boxes" (Up to the Pits), a long, left-hand uphill turn. At the end there are turns 14 and 15 that form what was once called "Cotovelo" (Elbow).

Interlagos has one of the longest pit-lanes ever used in Formula One. It starts just before the start-finish straight and rejoining the main course after Curva do Sol. Before 2007, the pits entrance was a difficult high-speed left turn. The pit lane entrance was changed to become safer for the 2007 Brazilian Grand Prix.

Tin(II) chloride, also known as stannous chloride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SnCl. It has tin and chloride ions in it. The tin is in its +2 oxidation state. 

It is a colorless crystalline solid. It is a reducing agent. It is poisonous to mollusks like clams and oysters. It reacts with water to make tin(II) oxide hydrate, which is white, and hydrochloric acid. That is why tin(II) chloride is normally dissolved in hydrochloric acid. It reacts with oxygen in the air to make tin(IV) chloride and tin(IV) oxide. It reacts with silver and gold compounds to make silver and gold metal. It also reacts with ferric compounds to make ferrous compounds.

It reacts with bases to make tin(II) oxide hydrate, which is white; if more base is added, the tin(II) oxide hydrate dissolves to make a clear solution again. 

It is made when tin reacts with hydrochloric acid.

It is used to electroplate tin on steel. It is used in the coloring of textiles. It is used to make silvered mirrors. A certain plastic uses it as a catalyst. It was used as a test for mercury(II) ions. If it is added to a colorless solution of mercury(II), a white solid of mercury(I) would form. If more is added, a black solid of mercury metal would be made. It turns bright purple in a solution that has gold ions in it. It is used in organic chemistry as a reducing agent.

James Wilson

James Wilson (September 14, 1742 – August 21, 1798) was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence. Wilson was elected two times to the Continental Congress, and was a major force in drafting the United States Constitution. He was a leading legal thinker, and he was one of the first six justices appointed by George Washington to the Supreme Court of the United States. Wilson was born in Scotland, but lived most of his life in Pennsylvania.

James Wilson was born in Carskerdo, near St. Andrews, Scotland. His parents were William Wilson and Alison Landall. Wilson attended a number of universities in Scotland without attaining a degree. Imbued with the ideas of the Scottish Enlightenment, he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in British America in 1766, carrying valuable letters of introduction. These helped Wilson to begin tutoring and then teaching at The Academy and College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania). He petitioned there for a degree and was awarded an honorary Master of Arts several months later.

Wilson started reading the law at the office of John Dickinson a short time later. After two years of studying, he got the bar in Philadelphia, and, in the following year (1767), set up his own practice in Reading, Pennsylvania. His office was very successful and he earned a small fortune in a few years. By then he had a small farm near Carlisle, Pennsylvania, was handling cases in eight local counties, and was lecturing at The Academy and College of Philadelphia.

On 5 November 1771, he married Rachel Bird, daughter of William Bird and Bridgette Hulings, they had six children together.

In 1774, Wilson wrote a pamphlet saying that the British Parliament had no power in America. He was for the Declaration of Independence when he was in the Continental Congress. During the American Revolution, he served in the Pennsylvania State Militia. He was also attacked at his house by a mob. This was called the Fort Wilson riot. Wilson also continued to practice law, and was France's lawyer in the U.S.

Wilson was one of the main political economists at the Constitutional Convention. He gave more speeches than anyone but Gouverneur Morris. He also proposed the three-fifths compromise, and sat on the Committee of Detail.

Wilson served on the United States Supreme Court from 1789 to 1798. He was the first associate justice nominated by George Washington.

The circuit uses the roads around the city's harbour and America's Cup port area. One section of the circuit uses a 140 metre long swing bridge. 
It also includes some roads designed to be used only for racing purposes by the German architect Hermann Tilke. Tilke also designed the buildings used for the circuit.

The deal to host the Valencia race was signed on 1 June 2007. It will last for seven years. The deal was made with the Valmor Sport group. The official track layout was unveiled by Valencia councillor and transport minister, Mario Flores, on 19 July 2007. The track was first used in the last weekend of July 2008. The circuit hosted a round of the Spanish F3 Championship and International GT Open. It was first used for the European Grand Prix on 24 August 2008.

The track is long and incorporates a total of 25 turns. There are 11 right-hand turns and 14 left-hand turns. It is estimated that the track has a top speed of around . Valencia is not as tight as Circuit de Monaco. There are not very many places to pass. The straights not not very straight the track gets very dusty off line. 

The circuit has been criticised by the drivers for its lack of overtaking opportunites. There have only been 4 recorded passes in the first race held in 2008, and no passes in 2009. There is little space in the circuit to make changes to improve passing.

Circuit Gilles Villeneuve

The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve is a motor racing circuit. It is the location the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix, NASCAR Canadian Tire Series, NASCAR Nationwide Series and Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series.

The Canadian Grand Prix was held at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve for 30 years. In , the race was dropped from the Formula One calendar and replaced with the new Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. On 27 November 2009, Quebec's officials and Canadian Grand Prix organisers announced an aggrement with Formula One and signed a new five-year contract. Circuit Gilles Villeneuve will host the Canadian Grand Prix from through the seasons. 

The circuit is located on Île Notre-Dame, a man-made island in the St. Lawrence River. It is part of the city of Montreal, was originally named the Île Notre-Dame Circuit. It was renamed in honour of Canadian Formula One driver Gilles Villeneuve, following his death in 1982. Gilles is the father of Jacques Villeneuve. The venue hosted the Champ Car World Series Grand Prix of Montreal from 2002 to 2006.

Barriers run close to the circuit and many experienced drivers have been caught out by them. A famous part of the circuit is the wall on the outside of the exit of the final chicane. The wall has the slogan "Bienvenue au Québec" ("Welcome to Quebec") painted on it. It has been giving the nickname "Mur du Québec" ("Quebec Wall"). In the wall ended the race of three Formula One World Champions, Damon Hill, Michael Schumacher, and Jacques Villeneuve. FIA GT champion Ricardo Zonta also crashed into the wall. Since then the wall has been nicknamed "The Wall Of Champions". Other drivers who have crashed into the wall include Jenson Button, Fernando Alonso, and Juan Pablo Montoya.

The curbs leading to the final chicane were made higher in . The new curbs were more difficult for the drivers to see, making the chicane even more challenging.

On 23 June 2006, Canadian Press reported that the city of Montreal had awarded Normand Legault the right to stage the race weekends on the track. Legault is the promoter of the Formula One race. The deal run until 2011, with an option to go to 2016. Legault decided to replace the Champ Car race with races from the Grand American Road Racing Association's Rolex Series and NASCAR's Nationwide Series. This would be NASCAR's first race in Canada. On 4 August 2007, Kevin Harvick made history by winning the first Nationwide Series (then Busch Series) race at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.

The NASCAR races have changed the circuit layout. The pit lanes were expanded. NASCAR pit lane must handle at least 43 cars.

As part of Parc Jean-Drapeau, the Circuit is open to visitors, between races, for walking, running, biking, in-line skating, etc. During the few days of the Grand Prix, Île Notre-Dame is one of the noisiest places in Montreal. At just about any other time of the year, it is one of the quietest, being located in the middle of a river, on an island filled with greenery and animals, joggers and cyclists. 

As the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve serves as host to different racing series, it is possible to directly compare different race series' lap times.

In 2002, former Champ Car Champion Juan Pablo Montoya set pole position for the Canadian Grand Prix with a lap time of 1:12.836. Several weeks later, during the inaugural Champ Car Grand Prix of Montreal, Cristiano Da Matta set pole position with a lap time of 1:18.959.

2006 was the last year Champ Car and F1 ran on the same track. The pole position in Formula One was set by Fernando Alonso in a time of 1:14.942. Sébastien Bourdais set pole in 1:20.005 in Champ Car. 

In 2007 NASCAR Nationwide Series (then Busch Series) driver Patrick Carpentier set a pole time of 1:42.086. The track record for the Rolex Sports Car Series is 1:33.199 set by Scott Pruett in 2008.

The movie stars Noah Ringer as Aang, the main hero of the story. Aang and his friends, Katara and Sokka, journey to the North Pole to find a Waterbending master to teach Aang and Katara how control the water. At the same time, Fire Lord Ozai, the current Fire Lord of the Fire Nation, is waging a seemingly endless war against the Earth Kingdom, the Water Tribes, and the already vanquished Air Nomads. The movie also stars Nicola Peltz, Jackson Rathbone, and Dev Patel.

The first of a planned trilogy, "The Last Airbender" was created by Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies. Development for a movie began in 2007; it was adapted into a movie by M. Night Shyamalan, who also directed and produced. Other producers include Frank Marshall, Kathleen Kennedy, Sam Mercer and Scott Aversano. The series from which it was adapted () was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. Filming began in mid-March 2009; the movie was released in both traditional two-dimensional projectors, as well as in 3D (using the RealD 3D format).<ref name="/FILM"></ref>

"The Last Airbender" was made for $150 million and marketed with a budget of $130 million, making total costs at least $280 million. Other estimates put the cost between $100 million and $110 million, while various news sources reported the whole "Last Airbender" trilogy would be made for around $250 million. Premiering in New York City on 30 June, 2010, it opened in the USA the following day, grossing an estimated $16 million.

The movie begins with Katara and Sokka find an iceberg and free Aang, and his flying bison, Appa. This attracts the attention of Zuko. Arriving to Southern Water Tribe, Zuko demands the elderly under the impression that Avatar is an old person until Aang is found. Aang surrenders himself to Zuko as long as he agrees to leave the village alone. Eventually he manages to maneuver away from the guards before Katara and Sokka arrive on Appa, making their escape. Aang and friends visit the Southern Air Temple where the Avatar learns that he was in the ice for 100 years and the Fire Nation killed all the airbenders. It was there Aang meets up with the only known remaining "flying lemur", naming it "" as it joins Aang's group. 

Arriving in a small town of Earth Kingdom that is controlled by the Fire Nation, Aang's group are arrested while helping a boy named Haru. They then incite a revolution with reminding the disgruntled Earthbenders that earth was given to them through the air ducts. After, Katara finds a Waterbending scroll that she and Aang used to teach waterbending. During a side track to the Northern Air Temple on his own, Aang is betrayed by a peasant and captured by a group of Fire Nation Yuu Yan archers, commanded by Zhao. However, a masked marauder, the "Blue Spirit" (Zuko), free Aang. Aware that Zuko is the "Blue Spirit," Zhao arranges the prince's demise. But Zuko survives the attempt on his life and, with Iroh's help, sneaks aboard Zhao's lead ship as his fleet departs for the Northern Water Tribe to execute the plan he and Ozai set up with the scrolls from the Library detailing the spirits there.

Upon arriving, Aang's group is welcomed warmly by the citizens of the Northern Water Tribe. Sokka falls in love with Princess Yue, while Aang and Katara master their waterbending skills under master Pakku. Once the Fire Nation armada arrives, Zhao begins his attack while Zuko infiltrates the tribe on his own, capturing Aang while he entered the spirit world to find the dragon spirit to give him the wisdom to defeat the Fire Nation. Coming to his senses, Aang battles Zuko before Katara freezes him. As the battles escalates, Iroh watches Zhao slay the moon spirit Tui, causing the Waterbenders to lose all of their powers and abilities to Waterbend. However, Yue, who was imbued with some of the energy of the Moon Spirit when she was a newborn, sacrifices her life to revive the Moon Spirit. As Zhao is drowned by Northern Waterbenders after Zuko and Iroh leave him to his fate, Aang uses the ocean to drive the armada back. Aang now fully embraces his destiny as the Avatar and prepares to continue their struggle against Ozai. When news of Zhao's death and Iroh's betrayal reaches him, Ozai appoints his daughter Azula to capture both her uncle and older brother while hindering the Avatar in any way before Sozin's Comet makes its return within three years time.

Season finale

A season finale (British English: last in the series; Australian English: season final) is the final episode of a season of a television program. This is often the final episode to be produced for a few months or longer, and, as such, will try to attract viewers to continue watching when the series begins again.

A season finale may contain a cliffhanger ending to be resolved in the next season. Alternatively, a season finale could bring open-ended storylines to a close, "going out on a high" and similarly maintaining interest in the series' eventual return.


The final episode of a television series often concludes the entire premise of the show.

There are examples of episodes, ostensibly having been the "season finale", unexpectedly becoming the "de facto" series finale due to the cancellation of the series. Recent examples of this include "John Doe", "Invasion", "Two Guys and a Girl", "Instant Star", "Las Vegas" and "Everybody Hates Chris".

In American English, the term has developed to describe the final event of a sporting season, e.g. in soccer or Motocross, perhaps partly because of the popularity of these with television viewers.

A1 road (Great Britain)

A1 is the official title of the Great North Road in Great Britain. It runs up the eastern side of England from London to Edinburgh in Scotland. It is 410 miles (660 km) long, and is the longest numbered road in the U.K.. The A1 has six major junctions with motorways, and over 20 major junctions with other A roads. 

The A1 follows, for much of the way, the course of a Roman road, Ermine Street, and the old coach route to Edinburgh. It is not a motorway or freeway, but much of it is now built to motorway standards. It is one of two main roads going from London to the North, the other being the M1 motorway.

Passing through Nottinghamshire, the road skirts the remains of Sherwood Forest. Scotch Corner, in North Yorkshire, marks the point where the traffic for Glasgow and the west of Scotland divides from that for Edinburgh, as it has for hundreds of years before motor traffic. From North Yorkshire to Durham the road follows, for part of the way, another Roman road called Dere Street. This road ran from Eboracum (York) to the Antonine Wall in the lowlands of present-day Scotland.

<doc id="259487" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=259487" title="Roman roads in Britain">
Roman roads in Britain

Roman roads, together with Roman aqueducts, and the Roman army, were the three of the most impressive features of the Roman Empire in Britain. 

In Britannia, as in other provinces, the Romans constructed a network of paved trunk roads (surfaced highways) during their nearly four centuries of occupation (43 – 410 AD). There are about 2,000 miles of Roman roads in Britain shown on the Ordnance Survey's "Map of Roman Britain". This contains the most accurate and up-to-date layout of certain and probable routes that is readily available to the general public. 

The pre-Roman Britons used unpaved trackways, including very ancient ones running along the ridges of hills, such as the South Downs Way, now a public long-distance footpath. In contrast, most of the Roman network was surveyed and built from scratch, with the aim of connecting key points by the most direct possible route. The roads were all paved, to permit heavy freight-wagons to be used in all seasons and weather.
Most of the known network was complete by 180 AD. Its main purpose was to allow the rapid movement of troops and military supplies. It was also vital for trade and the transport of goods.

Roman roads remained in use as trunk roads for centuries after the Romans withdrew from Britain in 410 AD. Systematic construction of paved highways did not resume in England until the 18th century.

The Romans became expert at constructing roads, which they called "viae". It was permitted to walk or drive cattle, vehicles, or traffic of any description along the road. The "viae" differed from the many other smaller or rougher roads, bridle-paths, drifts, and tracks. By law, the minimum width of a "via" was fixed at 2.4 m where it was straight, and 4.9 m where it turned.
The best sources of information as regards the construction of a regulation "via munita" are:

After the civil engineer looked over the site of the proposed road and determined roughly where it should go, the "agrimensores" went to work surveying the road bed. They used two main devices, the rod and a device called a "groma", which helped them obtain right angles. The rod men put down a line of rods called the "rigor". A surveyor looked along the rods and told the "gromatici" to move them as required. Using the "gromae" they then laid out a grid on the plan of the road.

The "libratores" then began their work using ploughs and, sometimes with the help of legionaries, with spades dug down to bed rock or at least to the firmest ground they could find. The excavation was called the "fossa", "ditch". The depth varied according to terrain. 

In top-quality roads, there were five layers, plus footpaths and kerbstones:

The method varied according to place, materials available and terrain, but the plan was always the same. The roadbed was layered. The road was constructed by filling the ditch. This was done by layering rock over other stones. 

Into the "fossa" was dumped large amounts of rubble, gravel and stone, whatever fill was available. Sometimes a layer of sand was put down, if it could be found. When it came to within 1 yd (1 m) or so of the surface it was covered with gravel and tamped down, a process called "pavire", or "pavimentare". The flat surface was then the "pavimentum". It could be used as the road, or additional layers could be constructed. A "statumen" or "foundation" of flat stones set in cement might support the additional layers.

The final steps used concrete, which the Romans had rediscovered (it had been used in Ancient Egypt). They seem to have mixed the mortar and the stones in the fossa. First a small layer of coarse concrete, the "rudus", then a little layer of fine concrete, the nucleus, went onto the pavement or "statumen". Into or onto the nucleus went a course of polygonal or square paving stones, called the "summa crusta". The "crusta" was crowned for drainage.

An example is found in a early basalt road by the Temple of Saturn on the Clivus Capitolinus. It had travertine paving, polygonal basalt blocks, concrete bedding (substituted for the gravel), and a rain-water gutter.

Though there are taco trucks all over the world, they are most often seen in Los Angeles and other Mexican-American cities. In many cities, such as Los Angeles, regular restaurants have tried to shut down taco trucks. This is because taco trucks sell food at a lower price than many restaurants. Taco trucks have been criticized in the past for being dirty and unhealthy, but this is not the case anymore.

It is the venue used for the Formula One Malaysian Grand Prix, A1 Grand Prix as well as the Malaysian MotoGP. The circuit was designed by German designer Hermann Tilke.

The main circuit is 5.54 km long. It is raced in a clockwise direction. It is noted for its sweeping corners and wide straights. The layout is unusual, with a very long back straight separated from the pit straight by just one very tight hairpin corner.

The circuit may be set-up with other configurations. The north circuit is the first half of the main circuit. The course turns back towards the pit straight after turn 6 and is 2.71 km long.

The south circuit is the other half of the circuit. The back straight of the main circuit becomes the pit straight. It joins onto turn 8 of the main circuit to form a hairpin turn. This circuit is 2.61 km in length.

Sepang International Circuit also features kart racing and motocross facilities.

<doc id="259609" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=259609" title="Phoronida">
Phoronida

The Phoronida, or horseshoe worms, are a small phylum of marine animals. There are twenty species, in two genera.

Phoronids are worm-shaped, but with a gut that loops and exits the body near the mouth. That explains the name 'horseshoe worms'. They are found in all oceans and seas (except the polar seas), and all species have wide geographical ranges. 

They occur at depths up to 400 metres, but mainly between 0 to 70 metres. The life span is thought to be about a year. The adults are tube worms, and secrete chitinous tubes in which they live. These tubes can be buried in the mud or sand or rest on the surface of a rocky substrate. If on rocks, they may live in colonies with their tubes become twisted around each other for support. Some species can dissolve away holes in rocks such as limestone, calcareous seashells or even cement piers; they then live in these holes which they line with their secreted tubes.

They feed using a lophophore, a ciliated structure that surrounds the mouth. Together with the Bryozoa and Brachiopoda, the phoronids belong to the lophophorates, sometimes treated as a single phylum. 

Though they are normally long, up to 50cm (30 in). Phoronids are normally very thin. 

The digestive tract of Phoronids consists of a short oesophagus which leads into a spherical stomach and then into the intestines which end in the anus. Phoronids have a simple blood system of one descending artery and ascending vein linked by a network of fine capillaries. There are also blood vessels into each of the tentacles. The blood is colourless but contains corpuscles with a haemoglobin-like pigment that helps to carry oxygen.

The nervous system is mainly composed by the nervous ganglion between mouth and anus, a ring nerve at the basis of the lophophore, one or two giant nerve fibres which issue from the ganglion and extend along the body wall. There are two tubular excretory organs, which discharge to the exterior via nephridiopores, on the anal papilla.

Phoronids may be hermaphrodites or single sexed, and may also reproduce asexually. Gametes are released through the nephridia. Fertilisation is probably internal. Phoronids follow one of two types of reproductive strategy. Some species, such as "Phoronis ovalis", lay only a few (12–25) large eggs which have a lot of yolk. These eggs are brooded within the adults tube, they are released only when they have hatched. The second strategy is to lay a much larger number (up to 500) of smaller eggs. These eggs are released as soon as they are fertilised. They hatch a few days later into what is called an 'actinotrocha' larvae. The larvae undergo a planktonic development for 2–3 weeks, and settle after about 20 days. Metamorphosis is 'catastrophic', occurring in less than 30 minutes and leading to a slender young phoronid.

Phoronids can regenerate the lophophore if it becomes damaged, in fact "Phoronis ovalis" voluntarily loses its lophophore in order to lay its eggs. Once the eggs are laid the animal grows a new lophophore.

Phoronids are suspension-feeders. They move their lophophores into the prevailing water current. Food particles in the water current are trapped in a stream of mucous that travels along the tentacles until it reaches the oral ring. There it is drawn into the mouth and then on into the digestive tract. Direct uptake of amino acids through the epidermis also occurs.

The fossil record of phoronids is poor. There are borings dating back to the Devonian which have been attributed to phoronids. "Iotuba chengjiangensis", a form known from only three specimens in the Lower Cambrian, has been interpreted as a phoronid because it appears to have had a U-shaped gut and was tentaculated. Phoronids may be related to the common but mysterious tubular fossils known as hederellids.

Shanghai International Circuit

The Shanghai International Circuit is a Chinese motor racing venue. It is located in the district of Jiading near Shanghai in the People's Republic of China. It was the venue of the first Formula One Chinese Grand Prix on 26 September 2004.

Costing approximately $450 million (USD), the circuit was paid for by a government-funded joint-venture company. This company was made up of the Shanghai Juss Corporation, Shanghai National Property Management Co Ltd, and Shanghai Jia'an Investment and Development Co Ltd. Architectural and design experts began visiting the site by April 2003. The site was transformed from swampland to an international racetrack in 18 months. A team of 3000 worked around the clock to finish the construction.

Other events held at the circuit include a round of the MotoGP world championship, the Australian-based V8 Supercar championship, and also the final round of the A1 Grand Prix in 2006 and 2007.

The 2008 MotoGP race was the last one at Shanghai International Circuit. The FIM didn't select the circuit for 2009 because of overcrowding problems.

Like many new Formula One circuits, Shanghai International Circuit was designed by Hermann Tilke. It features his trademark track feature: a long back straight followed by a hairpin turn. Current-generation F1 cars can easily exceed on the long straight between corners 13 and 14. The track layout was inspired from the Chinese character shang (上). Shang is the first character in the name of the city Shanghai, and means "above" or "ascend".

Circuit de Catalunya

The Circuit de Catalunya is a racetrack in Montmeló, to the north of Barcelona, Catalonia. It is home to the Formula One Spanish Grand Prix and the motorcycle Catalonia Grand Prix. With long straights and a variety of corners, the Circuit de Catalunya is seen as an all-rounder circuit. It is often used for off-season testing. 

The Circuit de Catalunya was built in 1991. It was planned to host its first race in 1992 to go with the Olympic Games. The Olympic Games were scheduled to take place in Barcelona. The circuit is often referred to as 'Barcelona' in the racing community, even though it is located in Montmeló. The Circuit de Catalunya should not be confused with the Montjuïc circuit, which hosted the Spanish Grand Prix four times between 1969 and 1975. Unlike the Circuit de Catalunya, Montjuïc circuit is actually located within the city of Barcelona.

Because of so much testing is done at this circuit, Formula One drivers and mechanics are extremely familiar with it. This has led to criticism that drivers and mechanics are too familiar with Catalunya, reducing the amount of on-track action.
When the circuit opened, overtaking was frequent. Cars could closely follow each other through the last two corners. They would slipstream down the long straight for a pass. As aerodynamic balance became more important, this overtaking method became less effective. The cars were unable to follow each other as close. They would encounter turbulence created by the leading car. This made it hard for a car to get close enough to pass. In the next to the last corner was replaced with a chicane. This was an effort to improve passing. The redesign did not increase the amount of overtaking.

The Circuit de Catalunya also plays host to many other racing series, including Moto GP. The chicane which was put in for Formula 1 does not exist in the track layout for Moto GP, and there are at least five points on the track where riders are known to pass. As in Formula 1, turn one is the most popular place for overtaking.

Because of the persistent presence of the ice sheet, the island is sometimes mistaken to be a part of Antarctica. Its area is 2,460 km² (950 sq mi); only a small portion of the island is free of ice and snow. The planet's southernmost active volcano, Erebus (3794 m), as well as the dormant volcano Terror (3230 m), are situated on the island. They were named by Ross after his ships HMS "Erebus" and HMS "Terror". The third highest peak is Mount Bird, and on its slopes are Shell Glacier and Endeavour Piedmont Glacier. Abbott Peak stands between Mount Erebus and Mount Bird.

Despite its relatively small size, Ross Island is the world's 6th highest island.

The island was discovered by Sir James Clark Ross in 1841, and it was later named in his honour by Robert F. Scott. 

Ross Island was the base for many of the early expeditions to Antarctica. It was and still is the southernmost island reachable by sea. Huts built by Scott's and Shackleton's expeditions are still located on the island, preserved as historical sites.

Today Ross Island is home to New Zealand's Scott Base, and the largest Antarctic settlement, the U.S. Antarctic Program's McMurdo Station. Greenpeace established World Park Base on the island and it ran for five years, from 1987 to 1992.

Ross Island lies within the boundaries of Ross Dependency, which is claimed by New Zealand.

Ross Island supports a colony of about a half million (500 000) Adélie Penguins.

Excretion

Excretion is one of the most basic functions of life. It is the process of eliminating waste products of metabolism and other non-useful materials. It is an essential process in all forms of life. It contrasts with secretion, where the substance may have specific tasks after leaving the cell.

In single-celled organisms, waste products are discharged directly through the surface of the cell. Multicellular organisms use more complex methods. Higher plants eliminate gases through the stomata on the surface of leaves. Animals have special excretory organs.

In mammals, excretion is the formation of urine in the kidneys, and expelling carbon dioxide from the lungs. These waste products are eliminated by urination and breathing out respectively. If excretion does not occur in an organism, waste products accumulate, which eventually kill the organism.

Also, food waste is expelled through the anus. Other substances are secreted into the bile, and then eliminated in the faeces. The skin and lungs also have excretory functions: the skin eliminates metabolic wastes like urea and lactic acid through sweating, and the lungs expell carbon dioxide.


Aquatic animals usually excrete ammonia directly into the water, as this compound is soluble and there is ample water available for dilution. In terrestrial animals ammonia-like compounds are converted into other nitrogenous materials as there is less water in the environment, and ammonia itself is toxic.

Reptiles and birds excrete their nitrogenous wastes as uric acid in the form of a white paste. This allows efficient water retention and it can be stored more easily in the egg. Both uric acid and faeces are expelled through a common opening called the cloaca. Their waste is usually two-coloured: part white (uric acid) and part green or black (organic waste).

Many bird species, especially seabirds, can also excrete salt via specialized nasal salt glands, the saline solution leaving through nostrils in the beak.

Vibration isolation

Vibration isolation is a system of devices to decouple a mechanical or structural object from its vibrating supports . 

For example, the handles of the saw presented in the right photo are separated from the engine and cutting bar to reduce shaking for the operator. Here, the spring mount is a part of this vibration isolation system.

When the targeted object is rather heavy (e.g. building, bridge or the like), vibration isolation may be called base isolation. Vibration isolation is a branch of protective techniques known as vibration control. 

From the very beginning, the theory of vibration isolation, in general, and of base isolation, in particular, rested on two pillars: "heavy damping" and "frequency separation". Unfortunately, nobody paid any attention that the heavy damping was a sort of a strong connection between a "substructure" and "superstructure", and that the idea of decoupling them with the help of such connections was of no good.

Megan Kanka

Megan Nicole Kanka (December 7, 1986 July 29, 1994) was raped and murdered by her neighbour Jesse Timmendequas, a convicted sex offender when she was seven-years-old.

Timmendequas tricked Kanka to come into his house by saying he had a puppy inside. Once Kanka noticed there was no puppy Timmendequas raped her, slammed her head into a dresser, strangled her, wrapped her head in a plastic bag, and strangled her with a belt. He put her body in his car and assaulted her once more before placing her in a toy chest and dumping it in a park in nearby West Windsor, New Jersey. When he went to court the jury sentenced him to death after convicting him of rape and murder.

The aftermath of this lead the New Jersey Legislature to pass a law called "Megan's Law" which requires convicted sex offenders to tell the local police department when they move into a neighborhood.

Privateer (motorsport)

In auto racing, a privateer is usually an person or race team that enters a race on their own. They are not directly supported by an automobile manufacturer. Privateer teams often build and maintain their own vehicles. 

In the early years of Formula One, privately-owned teams would race using a race car built by another team or constructor. Many privateer entrants compete for the enjoyment of the sport, and are not paid to be racing drivers.

The modern F1 Concorde Agreement now requires teams to build their own cars. In modern F1 terms, privateer is more often used to refer to a team who are not at least part-owned by large corporations, such as WilliamsF1.

<doc id="259731" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=259731" title="Concorde Agreement">
Concorde Agreement

The Concorde Agreement is a contract between the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the Formula One teams and the Formula One Administration. The Concorde Agreement defines the agreement about how the teams race, and how the money is divided up. The money includes the television revenue and prize money. 

There have been six Concorde Agreements since 1981. The terms of all of the agreements have been kept a secret. The secrecy was broken by racing journalist Forrest Bond when the 1997 Concorde Agreement was published in 2006 by RaceFax.

The basic requirements of the agreements are to be professional and to increase the success of Formula One. The biggest requirement of the teams to participate in every race. This makes Formula One better for the broadcasters. Broadcasters spend a large amount of money to televise the races. In return for racing, the teams were guaranteed a percentage of the sport's revenue.

The Commission Sportive Internationale, was an organization that reported to the FIA. They were the rule-making group for Formula One. In 1979 they were replaced by the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile, or FISA.

The race teams were represented by the Formula One Constructors Association, or FOCA. At the time, FOCA's chief executive was Bernie Ecclestone and his legal advisor was Max Mosley.

FISA and FOCA had a number of disagreements. Some teams believed that FISA was favoring the major manufacturers. The teams were also unhappy about how the money in Formula One was being distributed.

The FISA and FOCA disagreements became known as the FISA-FOCA war. This resulted in several races being canceled. Goodyear threatened to quit suppling tyres to Formula One. This would have been a disaster to the sport.

Bernie Ecclestone of FOCA organized a meeting of team managers and FISA representatives. The meeting was held at the offices of the FIA in the Place de la Concorde, Paris, France. At the meeting, they negotiated for thirteen straight hours. On 19 January 1981, the first Concorde Agreement was signed. The agreement was named after the plaza in Paris where the discussions took place.

The contract terms remain mostly confidential. It is known that teams were required to appear and compete in every race. This would ensure that the newly-acquired television public that they would have a race to watch. The agreement also granted FOCA the right to televise Formula One races. This may have been the most important part of the agreement. This right was "leased" to Formula One Promotions and Administration, a company created and owned by Bernie Ecclestone. Another important part of the agreement was that the rules would be kept stable.

The first Concorde Agreement expired on 31 December, 1987.

The second Concorde Agreement covered the through seasons.

The third Concorde Agreement covered the through seasons.

In 1995 the FIA decided to transfer Formula One's commercial rights from FOCA to Formula One Administration for a 14 year period. In exchange, Ecclestone would make an annual payment. McLaren, Williams, and Tyrrell did not like this arrangement. They rejecting the proposed Concorde Agreement. Ken Tyrrell was upset that Ecclestone, as President of FOCA, had transfer the rights to his own company. Mr. Tyrrell also did not like that the Agreement was secret. He believed that only helped Ecclestone. He felt it weakened the bargaining power of the teams.

On 5 September 1996 the new Concorde Agreement was signed by all the teams except McLaren, Williams, and Tyrrell. The agreement was to run from 1 January 1997 to 2002.

Taking a stand against Bernie Ecclestone, the FIA, and the commercial aspects of Formula One put McLaren, Williams, and Tyrrell in a bind. The three teams lost influence in the sport and income they would have received if they had signed. 

A compromise (agreement between all parties) was reached. On 27 August 1998, the 1998 Concorde Agreement was signed. This agreement expired on 31 December 2007.

A meeting on the new Concorde Agreement was held on 7 December, 2004. All of the teams but Ferrari attended the meeting. Ecclestone offered a payment of £260,000,000 over three years if all the teams would renew of the Concorde Agreement.

On 19 January 2005, Ferrari announced that it had signed an extension to the 1997 Concorde Agreement. The extension would expire on 31 December, 2012. Later that year, Red Bull and Jordan/Midland also signed an extension. (Jordan had been sold to Midland, but was still racing under the name Jordan.) On 7 December, 2005, Williams became the fourth team to sign an extension to the agreement. 

On 27 March, 2006, the five GPMA-backed teams (Jaguar, Honda, Ferrari, Toyota, and Renault) submitted their applications for the 2008 season. On 14 May, 2006, the five GPMA-backed teams signed a Memorandum of Understanding (a letter agreeing to the terms) with the commercial rights holders (CVC/Ecclestone). This formed the basis of the next Concorde Agreement. A full Concorde Agreement was not in place for the season, with the Memorandum and other individual teams acting as a temporary solution. 

On 29 July, 2008, the ten currently competing teams created the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) to negotiate the terms of contract. After a dispute between FOTA and the FIA in the first half of 2009, a new Concorde Agreement was signed by Mosley and all of the teams except BMW Sauber. BMW Sauber had announced it was going to withdraw from Formula One at the end of the season. The new agreement provides for a continuation of the terms of the 1998 agreement. It runs until 31 December 2012. 

A program of resource limits was also agreed on. Revised sporting and technical regulations for the season were set.

List of Futurama episodes

Futurama is a Fox animated television series, which originally aired on the network from March 28, 1999 to August 10, 2003. All four original production seasons are available on DVD. The DVD sets were entitled "Volume #" in Region 1 (USA), and "Season #" in the Regions 2 (Europe) and 4 (Australia). The Complete Collection DVD set was released on October 25, 2004 in Region 2, and on March 22, 2005 in Region 1. After cancellation on Fox four direct-to-DVD movies were released and later aired as 16 individual episodes on Comedy Central. 

"Futurama" was originally created as four seasons; Fox broadcast it out of the intended order as five seasons. This list is in production order for the first four seasons on Fox, primarily because this is the order used on the DVDs, as intended by the artists, and it helps avoid plot inconsistencies. A list of Futurama episodes by broadcast order is available in a separate article. The production code is the code used by Fox to indicate the production order of the episodes, and is in the format #ACV##. The first number represents the production season. ACV is Fox's series code for "Futurama". The second number is the episode's number. The TV broadcast code indicates the broadcast order. It is in the format S##E##, where S## indicates the broadcasting season of which there were 5, and E## indicates the episode's number. Seasons currently airing or in production are ordered by broadcast date as the DVD order is unknown, when the DVDs are released the order will be adjusted to represent the final order in case episodes have been aired out of the intended order as they did on Fox.

"Futurama" 's episode ratings in the United States are TV-PG for suggestive dialogue (D), offensive language (L), sexual content (S), and/or graphic violence (V) in its earlier episodes on Fox and on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim airings. The later episodes on Fox are rated TV-14 for suggestive dialogue (D), offensive language (L), sexual content (S), and/or graphic violence (V). The Comedy Central reruns are also rated TV-14, but do not include any of the sub-ratings. In the UK, "Futurama" episodes have been rated PG (parental guidance suggested when viewing) or 12 (not recommended viewing for anyone under 12 years of age), depending on the episode's content. The only episode not rated PG or 12 is "Leela's Homeworld," which is rated U (recommended for all ages).

Season five aired on Comedy Central from March 23, 2008 to August 30, 2009. It consisted of the four straight-to-DVD films divided into sixteen individual episodes.

Roerich’s Pact

Roerich Pact is a treaty on Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments, Apr. 15, 1935, 49 Stat. 3267, 167 L.N.T.S. 289 (hereinafter Roerich Pact) signed by (the Président of) the USA on a July 13, 1935. As of January 1, 1990, the Roerich Pact had been ratified by ten nations: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, United States, Venezuela. Entry into force: 26 August 1935. The Government of India approved the Treaty in 1948 but no further formal action was taken. Roerich Pact is also known as Pax Cultura ("Cultural Peace" or "Peace through Culture"). The most important idea of the Roerich's Pact is the legal recognition of the fact that the protection of culture always has precedence over any military necessity.

Russian painter and philosopher Nicholas Roerich
(1874-1947) initiated the modern movement for the defense of cultural objects, for the idea
of “Peace of Civilizations”. Besides the recognition as one of the
greatest Russian painters, Roerich’s most notable achievement was the Roerich Pact signed on April 15, 1935
by the representatives of 21 states in the Oval Office of the White
House (Washington, DC). 
President of the USA Franklin D. Roosevelt made a decisive influence on the process of signing of this treaty by all states of American continent. Incidentally, Roosevelt kept in his
private rooms a bust of Roerich. 

Nicholas Roerich was born on October 9, 1874, in St. Petersburg.

Roerich became a successful painter. One of his paintings was
purchased by Russian Tsar Nicolas ll. 

After 1918 Roerich left Russia. In 1923, the Roerich Museum was founded in New York. Presently, the Roerich Museumis located in Manhattan, at the corner of 107th Street and Riverside Drive. 
Finally Roerich had settled down in the Kulu Valley at the bottom of the Himalayas. He died on December 13, 1947.

In 1929, Nicholas Roerich in collaboration with Paris University professor Giorge Chklaver prepared a draft of an international treaty dedicated to protection of cultural values (Roerich Pact). 

The Roerich Pact was laid in the basis for the United Nations Hague “International Convention for Protection of Cultural Values in the Event of Armed Conflict” signed in 1954. But all ideas of Roerich Pact still do not fully implemented in the international law, especially the preference of the presevation of cultural values to the military necessity.

1904: Nicholas Roerich proposed the idea of the protection of artistic
and scientific achievements of humanity.

1914: Roerich proposed his idea to the then Russian Imperial
Government during World War I.

1929: Roerich proposed to the nations to establish a pact for
the preservation of the artistic and scientific world treasures.

1930: Pact was submitted to and approved by the Museums Committee
of the League of Nations. Founded: “Committee of the Roerich
Banner of Peace” (New York) and “Comité pour le Pact Roerich”
(Paris).

1931: Founded: “Union International pour le pact Roerich” (Bruges,
Belgium). September 13—15, 1931-First International Conference
dedicated to the promulgation of the Roerich Pact (Bruges).

1932: August 8-9, 1932 — Second International Conference of the
Roerich Pact (at Bruges). Founded: “Foundation Roerich pro Pace,
Arte, Scientiae et Labore” (Bruges).

1933: November 17-18, 1933 — Third International Convention
of the Roerich Pact and Banner of Peace (Washington, USA).

1935: April 15, 1935-the Treaty of the Roerich Pact signed at
the White House, Washington, USA, by 21 countries of the Pan
American Union.

1948: The Government of India approved the Roerich Pact.

The UN “Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in
the event of armed conflict” was adopted in The Hague on May 14,
1954. The Roerich Pact was used as a foundation for this Convention.
The Hague Convention became effective on August 7, 1956.

The High Contracting Parties, animated by the purpose of
giving conventional form to the postulates of the Resolution approved
on December 16, 1933, by all the States represented at
the Seventh International Conference of American States, held at
Montevideo, which recommended to “the Governments of America
which have not yet done so that they sign the ‘Roerich Pact’,
initiated by the Roerich Museum in the United States, and which
has as its object, the universal adoption of a flag, already designed
and generally known, in order thereby to preserve in any time of
danger all nationally and privately owned immovable monuments,
which form the cultural treasure of peoples”, have resolved to conclude
a treaty with that end in view, and to the eff ect that the treasures
of culture be respected and protected in time of war and in
peace, have agreed upon the following articles:

ARTICLE I
The historic monuments, museums, scientifi c, artistic, educational
and cultural institutions shall be considered as neutral and
as such respected and protected by belligerents.
Th e same respect and protection shall be due to the personnel
of the institutions mentioned above.
The same respect and protection shall be accorded to the historic
monuments, museums, scientifi c, artistic, educational and
cultural institutions in time of peace as well as in war.

ARTICLE II
The neutrality of, and protection and respect due to, the monuments
and institutions mentioned in the preceding article, shall be
recognized in the entire expanse of territories subject to the sovereignty
of each of the signatory and acceding States, without any
discrimination as to the State allegiance of said monuments and
institutions. The respective Government agrees to adopt the measures
of internal legislation necessary to insure said protection and
respect.

ARTICLE III
In order to identify the monuments and institutions mentioned
in Article I, use may be made of a distinctive flag (red circle with
a triple red sphere in the circle on a white background) in accordance
with the model attached to this treaty.

ARTICLE IV
The signatory Governments and those who accede to this treaty,
shall send to the Pan-American Union, at the time of signature
or accession, or at any time thereaft er, a list of the monuments and
institutions for which they desire the protection agreed to in this
treaty.
The Pan-American Union, when notifying the Governments of
signatures or accessions, shall also send the list of monuments and
institutions mentioned in this article, and shall inform the other
Governments of any changes in said list.

ARTICLE V
The monuments and institutions mentioned in Article I shall
cease to enjoy the privileges recognized in the present treaty in
case they are made use of for military purposes.

ARTICLE VI

ARTICLE VIII
The present treaty may be denounced at any time by any of the
signatory or acceding States, and the denunciation shall go into ef14
fect three months after notice of it has been given to the other signatory
or acceding States.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Plenipotentiaries,
after having deposited their full powers found to be in due and
proper form, sign this treaty on behalf of their respective governments,
and affi x thereto their seals, on the dates appearing opposite
their signatures.

The Roerich Pact proposed a flag for identification of protected objects – the Banner of Peace which was a white cloth containing a red ring and three red circles inscribed in it. The sign symbolized a unity of the past, present and future into the ring of eternity. Ideas of the Pact were reflected in Roerich’s art. Banner of Peace symbol one can see in many of his paintings.

The Roerich Pact is not only the international treaty. It is a conglomerate of legal ideas about a new state order then the state budget annually spent on culture, art and
education must be larger then military expenses. This is the legal recognition that the protection of cultural objects is more important than any
military necessity.
Roerich, considered the care for future generations to be a cornerstone of the existence of the the constitutional state. 

President of the USA, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the speech upon the signature of the ‘Roerich Pact’ Treaty said: “In opening this Pact to the adherence of the Nations
of the world, we are endeavoring to make
of universal application one of the principles
vital to the preservation of modern civilization.
This Treaty possesses a spiritual significance far
deeper than the text of the instrument itself. It is important to realize that the Roerich Pact was only
the first step towards the future development of a new legal culture.
The concrete conceptual provisions of Roerich’s philosophical and legal concept of the state are based on the idea that the primary duty of the state is
to preserve the national culture. 
Ideas of Roerich Pact still do not fully implemented in the international law .” and 21st century may be is a good time to implement them.

Nèi jìng is developed by using "nèigōng" (內功), or "internal exercises," as opposed to "wài gōng" (外功), "external exercises." 

Nèijiā is a broad term used mistakenly in the West as a synonym for the more specific Wǔdāngquán styles, named for their association with the Taoist monasteries of Wudangshan range, Hubei Province in Chinese popular legend. These styles are enumerated by Sun Lutang as Tàijíquán, Xíngyìquán and Bāguàzhǎng, but must also include Bājíquán and the legendary Wudang Sword. Some other Chinese arts, not in the Wudangquan group, such as Liuhebafa, Bak Mei Pai, Bok Foo Pai and Yiquan are frequently classified (or classify themselves) as "internal".

Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)

The Brahmajala Sutta is the first of 34 suttas in the Digha Nikaya (the Long Discourses of the Buddha). The name comes from 'brahma' (perfect wisdom) and 'jala' (net-which-embraced-all-views). The sutta is also called 'Atthajala' (Net of Essence), Dhammajala, (Net of the Dhamma), Ditthijala (Net of Views), Anuttarasangama Vijaya (Incomparable Victory in Battle).

The sutta discusses two main topics: the elaboration of the Ten Precepts (Cula-sila), the Middle Precepts (Majjhima-sila), and the Great Precepts (Maha-sila). Cula-sila deals with the Ten Precepts to be practised by devout buddhists, while Majjhima-sila gives a detailed description of the practice of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth precepts, together with the practise of plant conservation and speech etiquette.

The second and third parts of the sutta discuss the 62 beliefs (ditthi) which are devoutly practised by ascetics in India. These are divided into: 18 beliefs related to the past (pubbantanuditthino), and 44 beliefs about the future (aparantakappika).

Many of these beliefs are still relevant in the modern world and thus the sutta provides Buddhist scholars with much information to ponder about the Buddha's teachings.

The elaboration of these beliefs is very detailed, focusing on how the beliefs (faiths) come to be and the way they are described and declared. The elaboration ends with the Buddha's statement about the danger of clinging to these beliefs, as they are still influenced by desire (lobha), hatred (dosa), and ignorance (moha) that its faithful followers will not end in the final liberation but still in the cycle of samsara. Believers of these faiths are compared to small fish in a pond which will be captured by a fine net no matter how much they want to escape, while those who see reality as it is are beyond the net of samsara.

Josephson is one of the more well-known scientists who say that parapsychological phenomena may be real, and is also interested in the possibility that Eastern mysticism may have relevance to scientific understanding. In 2005, Josephson said that "parapsychology should now have become a conventional field of research, and yet parapsychology's claims are still not generally accepted". He compared this situation to that of Alfred Wegener's hypothesis of continental drift, where there was initially great resistance to acceptance despite the strength of the evidence.

<doc id="259792" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=259792" title="V12 engine">
V12 engine

A V12 engine often just called a V12 is an internal combustion engine with 12 cylinders. The engine has six cylinders on each side called banks. The two banks form a "V" shaped angle. In most engines, the two banks are at a 60° angle to each other. All twelve pistons turn a common crankshaft. It can be powered by different types of fuels, inlcuding gasoline, diesel and natural gas.

Each cylinder bank is basically a straight-6. This set-up has perfect balance no matter which V angle is used. A V12 engine does not need balance shafts. A V12 angled at 45°, 60°, 120°, or 180° from each other has even firing and is smoother than a straight-6. This provides a smooth running engine for a luxury car. In a racing car, the engine can be made much lighter. This makes the engine more responsive and smoother. In a large heavy-duty engine, a V12 can run slower, and prolonging engine life.

V12 engines were first used in aircraft. By the end of World War I, V12s were popular in the fighters and bombers. Many Zeppelins had V12 engines. 

The Rolls-Royce Merlin V12 powered the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire fighters that played a vital role in Britain's victory in the Battle of Britain. The long, narrow configuration of the V12 contributed to good aerodynamics, while its exceptional smoothness allowed its use with relatively light and fragile airframes. 

After World War II, V12 engines were mostly replaced by turbojet and turboprop engines. These engines produced more power for their weight, and fewer problems in large aircraft.

In cars, V12 engines are not common because of their complexity and cost. They are normally found only in high-end sports cars and luxury cars. For these cars, they are desired for their power, low vibration, and distinctive sound.

Before World War II, V12 engines were found in many luxury cars. In the 1930's, V8 engines started to replace the V12s. The V8 engine design was improved to make it lighter and produce more power than the V12. Since World War II, only a few car manufactures have used V12 engines. 

In 1997, Toyota equipped their Century Limousine with a 5.0 L V12, making it the first Japanese production passenger car with a V12. In 2009, China FAW Group Corporation equipped their Hongqi HQE with a 6.0 L V12, making it the first Chinese production passenger car so equipped.

In the past, V12 engines were common in Formula One and endurance racing. Ferrari used V12 engines in 1950, the first year of Formula One. Several factors made teams stop using the V12 engine. Improvements to the V8 engine, in particular Ford Cosworth engine. Small, lightweight turbocharged engines were developed that produced more power for the weight. And finally rule changes that limited the size of engines and the power they could produce.

In the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans, the first place car was a Audi R10 TDI, with a V12 diesel engine. The second place car was a Peugeot 908, also with a V12 diesel.

V12 is a common configuration for large diesel engines. Heavy trucks often use large V12 engines. Many diesel locomotives have V12 engines. Mercedes (MTU) builds V12 diesel engines for marine use. 

V12 is a common configuration for tanks and other armored fighting vehicles (AFVs).

This is a list of the world's best-selling albums. The criteria are that the figure must have been published by a reliable source and the album must have sold at least 20 million copies worldwide. Most albums have different estimates of sales. In this list, the highest sales reported for an album is added to the list. Groupings are based on different sales benchmarks. The highest benchmark is for claims of at least 100 million copies, and the lowest are for claims of 20–29 million copies. Albums are listed in order of number of copies sold and by the artist's first name. This list contains all types of albums, including studio, greatest hits, compilation, various artists, soundtrack and remix.

A number of issues make exact figures difficult to calculate, as historical data before the 1980s and from developing countries is incomplete. Also, fans, record companies and the media are prone to making the sales figures higher than they actually are to boost the image of the act. The list also does not take into account the resale of used albums or as the emergence of illegal downloading of digital music.

I'm Outta Time

"I'm Outta Time" is a single by the rock band Oasis. The song is featured on their seventh studio album "Dig Out Your Soul". The second single from the album, "I'm Outta Time" was written by lead vocalist Liam Gallagher and released on 1 December 2008.

The song has similarity, in style, to John Lennon's work in the early 1970s. The piano which features on the track partly sounds like Lennon's "Jealous Guy". The song also has a backing piano similar to The Beatles' "A Day in the Life". Liam jokingly claims that it took him nine years to write the song.

The song features a short speech from John Lennon taken from one of his last interviews in 1980. The speech sample says: "As Churchill said, it's every Englishman's inalienable right to live where the hell he likes. What's it going to do, vanish? Is it not going to be there when I get back?".

The song has been noted as one of the highlights of the album, with guitarist Noel Gallagher labeling it "deceptively brilliant". It has also been praised by music critics, with "NME" calling it a return to form, and comparing it to the music of Oasis-admired rock band The Beatles.

It charted at #12 in the UK Singles Chart - the first Oasis single to miss the top ten since 1994, ending the band's streak of 22 consecutive top tens. It has so far spent a total of 24 weeks in the French Singles Chart, the most ever by any Oasis single. However, the single spent only two weeks in the UK top 75, the least ever by any Oasis single.

The music video for "I'm Outta Time" was released in November 2008. It was filmed in black and white, and shows Liam Gallagher, the only band member to appear in the clip, on a "surreal journey through a moon-lit English landscape". At the end of the video, Liam is filmed in a close-up profile shot lying down. This bears resemblance to the back cover artwork for John Lennon's album "Imagine".

The song was covered by Lily Allen on BBC's Live Lounge on December 2nd, 2009.

Hemichordata

The Hemichordata is a phylum of worm-shaped marine deuterostome animals, generally considered the sister group of the echinoderms. They date back to the Lower or Middle Cambrian and include an important class of fossils called graptolites, most of which became extinct in the Carboniferous. 

The bodies of Hemichordates are divided into three parts, proboscis, collar and trunk. They have open circulatory systems and a complete digestive tract but the musculature in their gut is very poorly developed, and food is mostly transported through it by using the cilia that cover its inside surface.

A hollow neural tube exists among some species (at least in early life), probably a primitive trait they share with the common ancestor of chordata and the rest of the deuterostomes.

The hemichordates give us the closest living phylogenetic relatives between the chordates and other invertebrates. Thus these marine worms are of great interest to those studying the origins of chordate development. 

Hemichordates are known to develop in two ways: either directly or indirectly. Hemichordates are a phylum composed of two living classes the enteropneusts and the pterobranchs. The enteropneusts have two developmental strategies: direct and indirect development. The indirect development is ends in an long pelagic larval stage. This means that these species have a larval stage which feeds on plankton before turning into an adult worm. Those species that develop directly bypass this prolonged larval stage and develop directly into an adult worm.

Graptolites are commonm fossils from the Palaeozoic. They are colonial animals known chiefly from the Upper Cambrian to the Lower Carboniferous (Mississippian). A possible early graptolite, "Chaunograptus", is known from the Middle Cambrian. 

The name graptolite comes from the Greek "graptos", meaning 'written', and "lithos", meaning 'rock'. Many graptolite fossils resemble hieroglyphs written on the rock. Linnaeus originally regarded them as "pictures resembling fossils rather than true fossils". More recent work places them near the pterobranchs, possibly within.
Each graptolite colony is known as a rhabdosome and has a variable number of branches (called "stipes") coming from an initial individual. Each subsequent zooid is housed within a tubular or cup-like structure (called a theca). In some colonies, there are two sizes of theca, and it has been suggested that this difference is due to sexual dimorphism.
The number of branches and the arrangement of the thecae are important features in the identification of graptolite fossils. Their general shape has been compared with that of a hacksaw blade.

Most of the tree-like forms are classified as dendroid graptolites (order Dendroidea). They appear earlier in the fossil record (in the Cambrian), and were benthic animals attached to the sea-floor by a root-like base. Graptolites with relatively few branches were derived from the dendroid graptolites at the beginning of the Ordovician period. This latter type (order Graptoloidea) were pelagic, drifting freely on the surface of ancient seas or attached to floating seaweed by means of a slender thread. They were a successful and prolific group, being the most important animal members of the plankton until they died out in the early part of the Devonian period. The dendroid graptolites survived until the Carboniferous period.

The Acorn worms or Enteropneusta are a Hemichordate class of invertebrates, closely related to the chordates. There are about 70 species of acorn worm in the world, the main species for research being "Saccoglossus kowaleski".

All species are benthic, and either deposit feeders or suspension feeders. Some of these worms may grow to be very long; one particular species may reach a length of 2.5 meters (almost eight feet), although most acorn worms are much smaller. One genus, "Balanoglossus", is also known as the tongue worm.

Pterobranchia is a clade of small, worm-shaped animals. They belong to the Hemichordata, and live in secreted tubes on the ocean floor. Pterobranchia feed by filtering plankton out of the water with the help of cilia attached to tentacles. There are about 30 known living species in the group.

The class Pterobranchia was established by E. Ray Lankester in 1877. It contained, at that time, the single genus "Rhabdopleura". The publication of the Challenger Report ("Cephalodiscus") in 1887, showed that "Cephalodiscus", the second genus now included in the order, had affinities in the direction of the Enteropneusta.

Studies under an electron microscope have suggested that pterobranchs belong to the same clade as the extinct graptolites.

Deus ex machina

Deus ex machina is the Latin version of an ancient Greek phrase "ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός".

The phrase means means "the god from the machine". It comes from the theatre of ancient Greece, which had a kind of crane for delivering gods onto the stage on wires. 

By extension, the term means a plot device whereby a seemingly overwhelming problem is suddenly solved by means which are arbitrary, and do not follow from the logic of the narrative (story).

For example, in Euripides' play "Alcestis", the heroine agrees to give up her own life in order to spare the life of her husband, Admetus. At the end Heracles shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and to Admetus. A more frequently cited example is Euripides' "Medea" in which the "deus ex machina" is used to convey Medea, who has just committed murder and infanticide, away from her husband Jason to the safety and civilization of Athens.

Aristotle criticized the device in his "Poetics", where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play:

I don't think you should be given the flag for this anymore until you understand how categories work. You just put a very large number of articles into categories that they should not have been put into. For example you put a bunch into a Sports category. Well all those articles were already in subcategories of the sports category, as such they don't belong in the parent category. I wouldn't doubt you did that with alot of others. The 3000 or so changes you made yesterday probably have to all be reversed now. Please be aware that you are also not supposed to surpase 12 edits a minute with any automated/semi automated editing per the bot policy. So slow down and consider what you are doing to each article.

Hello all, as you might have heard, Jamesofur has obtained a job that might bring him into a conflict of interest. He has therefore been asked to relinquish his roles of Checkuser, and of Bureaucrat. If we decide to re-assign those flags, this means that there is one opening for a bureaucrat, and one for a chheckuser; Any active admin can apply for either post. Checkusers must be legally adult in the country they live, and they must also be able/ willing to supply proof of identity to the foundation. In addition they must be able to gather about 25 votes (in other words: all the active, named users). What do you think, would it make sense to fill the two posts anew? -- () 19:55, 19 August 2010 (UTC)

Hi all! I've just right now given back the mop to . He left about 13 months ago this wiki for a good understandable rationale which he explained to me via email. The request for desysop can be found on meta. I know that it is over one year ago, but we haven't removed him per . He left uncontroversial, and so I don't see any issue with giving the rights back. The rule says that he has to go through a re-RfA after he was desysopped for inactivity. Since we haven't decided how to act when he voluntarily left and comes back, I've used the discretion given to me by the community. Furthermore, I'd like to say, that he was fairly active.

I know this is a grey area. I hope you can life with my decission, if not, any bureaucrat is free to remove the flag. If I see many people having a problem with this, I will remove the flag as well and Exert has to go through a re-RfA then. Thanks for understanding! - () 21:24, 5 September 2010 (UTC)

Hi all, it has come to my attention that apparently it's been accepted practice here for admins to decline unblock requests on blocks that they placed themselves. So, if Admin Joe blocks User Mary, and User Mary asks to be unblocked, Admin Joe may come back and decline that request. 

I believe this is a poor practice for us to have. In my opinion, admins should never decline requests on their own blocks (though, they can always overturn their own blocks--unless they carried out community consensus with their original block, then they'd need community support to overturn). An uninvolved admin should be the only one reviewing the block. The blocking admin can offer comments about the request, but they should never be the person to directly decline it. The point of someone asking for an unblock is to have others review the situation, it is not asking for the blocking admin to come in and place judgment on the user once again. 

Some people have said that reviewing blocks should be no different than reviewing deleted pages: users ask the deleting admin to overturn their decision to delete the page. I disagree. Blocks affect account access and could, in effect, make the user feel "powerless." Now he asks for a review of his block and who is it reviewed by? The same person who took away his "power" in the first place. This is definitely not to reviewing a deleted page.

I'd like to hear other thoughts here. Do others feel that this actually is common practice here? If it is, should we stop? Or are others okay with it as it is? I must say, until last night, I had never heard that it was "common practice" around here to do that on Simple. () 16:17, 11 September 2010 (UTC)
(<-) My opinion is as follows:

Well, we are talking about me here so ... I see it like this; an admin places a block, the blocked user then asks that admin to reconsider using . If the blocking admin declines this "review", then (as the template clearly says) another admin can also review and unblock if they see fit. If I then disagree with that unblocking I can bring it to AN for discussion. I'm fine with anyone reviewing my block, but please give me the chance to respond to the blocked users first ok? Afterall, I blocked them and I deserve the chance to respond to a request for unblocking. 22:35, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

Common sense applies here folks. There are instances where its fine for the blocking admin to review their own block. I know this isn't en, but on en its common for an admin to review their own block. In fact its frowned upon for another admin to unblock without talking to the blocking admin. We elected admins because we trust them. So lets trust them to use their common sense as to when is a good time for them to consider unblocking and when they should leave it to another admin. - () 22:45, 13 September 2010 (UTC)
Eitherway has my pulse. I've always felt it bad practice for administrators to review their own blocks, for the reasons outlined above. I believe that uninvolved admins should decline or accept the unblock template. Thanks, @:~$ 07:42, 14 September 2010 (UTC)

Negative, you made it about me when you stated above my past history and the point of your asking was so that you could "can point to this if 'I' complain next time" as you state above also. Look at yourself. @:~$ 19:49, 14 September 2010 (UTC)
<-Dear Nonvocalscream, your good name was not being sullied. :) No one can possibly have a doubt of your excellence, but arguing surely isn't what either bureaucrat, rightly or wrongly looked up as a role model of editorship, should do. As for myself, I only have a few comments to say: I'd rather have it be a recommended "common practice" for uninvolved administrators who were not responsible for the block to review it. This makes the person who is getting blocked have a feeling of fairness. However, as with all rules, this should only be "recommended" and not always "necessary" - common sense should prevail, and what is done is done. It can always be reviewed again. In this case, for example, the administrators who commented on the matter seemed to agree with Purplebackpack's block, so even if another administrator had reviewed it, I doubt the result would have been much different. Cordially, — 09:00, 15 September 2010 (UTC)
Lots of admins on enwiki review their own blocks! But ... Ok, it comes down to this. I know I'm a fair person and I know I'm more than capable of deciding whether or not I should have unblocked or not PBP per his . It was not a controversial block. Those times I have felt "compromised" I have asked others to review, and will continue to do so. But, I shall also continue to review my own blocks if I think it's fair to do so. Other admins have expressed similar views, so unless we are going to have a vote, I consider the matter ended. Like I said, trust me or fire me: I know I've never let you down as an admin! 23:53, 17 September 2010 (UTC)

Ok seriously folks. This discussion is getting to a level of drama causing multiple good faith admins to feel they are being personally attacked. The discussion on a policy itself is not bad and I would certainly have my own personal opinions to add but it has gotten to a point where it is no longer helping ANYTHING. I would encourage people to come down, relax, have a beer or a soda and either take some time off of the discussion or come back to it with a total "no one did wrong we just want to figure out best practices" mindset. I'm sure some of you are trying to do that, maybe all of you are, but we have not all come across like that. So with that in mind why don't we start the discussion anew (I'm not going to hide the above for now but I wouldn't argue if someone else did). " ( )" 02:27, 18 September 2010 (UTC)

So to start it off. What do people think is a good policy for this? Has anyone created a draft yet or maybe multiple people want to? That or we can just talk here about it for now. I personally think I trust administrators to review their own blocks at least once. I think that can be a good opportunity for the blocked user to explain their side if they felt they didn't get a chance too or to apologize etc. I think that if the block is denied and another request is filed fairly quickly it would be best to have someone else look at it to avoid the appearance of conflict even when there isn't any. 

I would say that I think the en method isn't bad. In general the blocking template and many admins actually encourage putting the unblock on hold to talk with the blocking admin before unblocking. When the unblock reason is valid it is then very VERY frequent that the blocking admin will unblock himself. When the admin isn't sure he will usually say that he won't do it but the 2nd admin is welcome to if he feels it is appropriate. I've found it fairly rare that if the blocking admin said no you shouldn't unblock that he was overruled (without drama)." ( )" 02:27, 18 September 2010 (UTC)
May I make a suggestion which may satisfy (or dissatisfy) both "sides". I would like to suggest the current two-step unblock request process be changed to a three-step unblock process, as follows:
I believe this method is essentially what we are doing now, when an admin reviews his/her own block, but it makes it a little more transparent to the blocked user that, if his request is declined, that a second admin has also reviewed it and confirmed the original blocking admin's decisions. If there is disagreement, the reviewing admin needs to communicate with the original blocking admin regarding the reason for declining the unblock request. It adds a small amount of bureaucracy (which I am generally against), but this discussion has essentially become stale and I hope this will at least lead to some discussion that will help resolve this disagreement. 13:38, 18 September 2010 (UTC)

Hello, I am sad to say that it seems me and another editor can not reach an agreeable compromise on the validity of sources and therefore their relevancy and use in an article. We need an administrator's input because we are almost in an editing war and we are probably getting emotionally involved too much with the article which is causing friction. The article is Amy Elizabeth Thorpe and you can see the general dispute between me (Leidseplein) and editor Nihil Novi on the talk page. I regret that I in the talk page posted irrelvant opinions about this editor's motivations and also used the page as a general discussion of the subject matter, as I think the other editor did as well. It seems to me the basic dispute is about one very small point in the overall article: namely, whether Amy Elizabeth Thorpe provided any early help solving the Enigma decrypts in World War II, as mentioned by several cited sources in print and online. The other editor rejects any source that mentions her related to Enigma including numerous published accounts by journalists and respected authors. The other editor's main effort, it seems to me by his stated projects and other work on Wikipedia, is to forward a cherished opinion of history that only Poland and Polish people provided early help solving the Enigma problem - even though the work of Amy Thorpe in no way diminishes the work of Poles which is the focus of this editor. Besides an endless talk page debate, the other editor repeatedly tags points in the article as dubious with which he merely does not agreee - even though the points aren't dubious as they are given as the published opinion of a major historical figure. I've also included a compromise in the article that states these sources are rejected by the Polish experts, but this compromise is unsatisfactory to the other editor who on his own decides dozens of independant published sources are "unreliable".

How can we resolve this problem?
The article on Santa Lucia Stroncone Astronomical Observatory has come up for . It was nominated by whom I blocked for a vandalism-only account.

Quaker Oats Company

The Quaker Oats Company is an American food division business headquarted in Chicago. They manufacture Quaker Oats Oatmeal, Cap-N-Crunch cereal, and granola bars. Quaker Oats Company is owned by PepsiCo, Inc. They also manufacture a lot of things too. Quaker is a subsidiary of Gatorade. Quaker was a subsidiary of Fisher-Price a toy business until 1991.

Quaker Oats was founded in 1901 by the merger of four oat mills:


Quaker Oats Company stretched into several areas, including other breakfast cereals and other products like food and drinks, and even to non related products like toys. 

In 1969 Quaker got Fisher-Price, a toy business and ceased operations in 1991.

In the 1970s, the company marketed the making of the film "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory", obtaining in return a license to use a number of the product names used and seen in the movie for candy bars. 

In 1983, Quaker bought Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., makers of Gatorade.

Quaker bought Snapple for $1.7 billion in 1994 and sold it to Triarc in 1997 for $300 million.

In August 2001, Quaker was bought out by Pepsico because Pepsi wanted to own Gatorade and be in the sports beverage market. The merger created the fourth-largest consumer goods company in the world. Though the main prize for PepsiCo was Gatorade sports drink, Quaker's cereal and snack food division serves as seemingly healthier complement to the existing Frito-Lay salty-snacks division.

Since the late 1980s, actor Wilford Brimley has appeared in television commercials extolling the virtues of oat consumption, typically to a young child, as to introduce the concept of oatmeal consumption as a long tradition.

As of 2005, these are the product brands marketed under the Quaker Oats name in the US:





As of 2008, these are the product brands marketed under the Quaker Oats name in the UK:

Hurricane Marilyn

Hurricane Marilyn was the fifteenth tropical depression and thirteenth named storm of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. Hurricane Marilyn was the strongest storm to hit the Virgin Islands since Hurricane Hugo of 1989, and caused thirteen deaths and more than $2 billion dollars in damage.

Marilyn formed on September 13, and grew to hurricane strength soon after. Marilyn made landfall on the Lesser Antilles on September 14, 1995 at Category 1 strength. By the time it reached the U.S. Virgin Islands, Marilyn was a Category 3 strength hurricane. After heading north past Bermuda, Marilyn weakened and became an extratropical cyclone before dying out just south of Nova Scotia on October 1st, 1995.

Marilyn came from a tropical wave that formed off the African coast to the eastern Atlantic Ocean on September 7 and September 8. Large, low-level winds were included in the wave's circulation. However, little convection existed. The system continued west for a few days at about . On September 12, what was to be Hurricane Marilyn was named Tropical Depression Fifteen after convection increased. TD-15 strengthened quickly, and became Tropical Storm Marilyn six hours later.

Margot Frank

Margot Betti Frank (16 February 1926 – early March 1945) was the older sister of Anne Frank. She died in a concentration camp. According to the famous diary of her sister Anne, Margot was keeping a diary as well, but no trace of Margot's diary has ever been found. Quiet, polite Margot was very different from her energetic, friendly sister Anne. She was the first daughter of Otto Frank (1889 – 1980), a German businessman, and Edith Frank-Holländer (1900 – 45). She was named after her mother's sister. According to Anne's diary, Margot wanted to be a midwife in Palestine.

On 13 March 1933, elections were held in Frankfurt, and Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party won. Acts of Antisemitism began almost immediately. The Franks were afraid of what might happen to them if they stayed in Germany. Therefore, later that year, Edith, Anne, and Margot went to Aachen. They stayed there with Edith's mother, Rosa Holländer. Otto remained in Frankfurt, but after getting an offer to start a company in Amsterdam, he moved there to begin the business and to find a place to live with his family. The Franks were included in the 300,000 Jews who ran away from Germany between 1933 and 1939.

Anne often felt jealousy about her sister, whom she thought was pretty, clever, and everyone's favorite, and Margot was not often mentioned in her diary. However, when the sisters went into hiding, they became closer towards each other. On 12 January 1944, Anne wrote, "Margot's much not nearly so catty these days and is becoming a real friend. She no longer thinks of me as a little baby who doesn't count."

<doc id="260128" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=260128" title="St Albans Cathedral">
St Albans Cathedral

St Albans Cathedral (formerly St Albans Abbey) is an Anglican church in St Albans, Hertfordshire. At , its nave is the longest of any cathedral in England. With much of its present architecture dating from Norman times, it became a cathedral in 1877. Local residents often call it "the Abbey", although the present cathedral represents only the church of the old Benedictine abbey.

The church, although legally a cathedral, differs in certain ways from most of the other cathedrals in England. It is also used as a parish church, of which the Dean is rector. He has the same powers, responsibilities, and duties as the rector of any other parish.

Alban was a pagan living in the Roman city of Verulamium, where St Albans is now, in Hertfordshire, England, about north of London along Watling Street. Before Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, local Christians were being persecuted by the Romans. Alban sheltered their priest, Amphibalus, in his home and was converted to the Christian faith by him. When the soldiers came to Alban's house looking for the priest, Alban exchanged cloaks with the priest and let himself be arrested in his stead. Alban was taken before the magistrate, where he avowed his new Christian faith and was condemned for it. He was beheaded, according to legend, on the spot where the cathedral named for him now stands.

The date of Alban's execution is a matter of some debate, and is generally given as "circa" 250—scholars suggest dates of 209, 254 or 304. The Tomb of St Amphibalus is also in the Cathedral.

Much of the current layout and proportions of the structure date from the first Norman abbot, Paul of Caen (1077–1093). The 14th Abbot, he was appointed by the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc.

The cruciform (cross shaped) abbey was the largest built in England at that time. the Norman Robert the Mason gave particular attention to solid foundations, running a continuous wall of layered bricks, flints and mortar below and pushing the foundations down to twelve feet to hit bedrock. Below the crossing tower special large stones were used.

The tower was a particular triumph—it is the only 11th century great crossing tower still standing in England. Robert began with special thick supporting walls and four massive brick piers. The four-level tower tapers at each stage with clasping buttresses on the three lower levels and circular buttresses on the fourth stage. The entire structure weighs 5,000 tons and is 144 feet high. The tower was probably topped with a Norman pyramidal roof; the current roof is flat. The original ringing chamber had five bells, but none of them has survived.

The monastic abbey was completed in 1089 but not consecrated until Holy Innocent's Day, 28 December 1115, by the Archbishop of Rouen. King Henry I attended as did many bishops and nobles.

A nunnery (Sopwell Priory) was founded nearby in 1140.

In the current structure the original Norman arches survive under the central tower and on the north side of the nave. The arches in the rest of the building are Gothic, following mediaeval rebuilding and extensions, and Victorian era restoration.

The abbey was extended in the 1190s by Abbot John de Cella (also known as John of Wallingford) (1195–1214). The severe Norman west front was rebuilt by Hugh de Goldclif. It was very costly but its rapid weathering and later alterations have removed all but fragments. 

The St Albans Psalter ("circa" 1130–45) is the best known of a number of important Romanesque illuminated manuscripts produced in the Abbey scriptorium. Later, Matthew Paris, a monk at St Albans from 1217 until his death in 1259, was important as a chronicler and an artist. Eighteen of his manuscripts survive and are a rich source of contemporary information for historians.

Nicholas Breakspear was born near St Albans and went to school there. He applied to be admitted to the abbey as a novice, but was turned down. He eventually managed to be accepted into an abbey in France. In 1154 he was elected Pope Adrian IV, the only English Pope there has ever been. The head of the abbey was confirmed as the premier abbot in England, also in 1154.

Parish

A parish is the area which is served by a church. This term is used by these churches: Church of England and the Anglican Communion, Roman Catholic, the Eastern Orthodox Church, Lutheran churches, and some Methodist, and Presbyterian churches. The idea is that the local priest or minister is responsible for the 'souls' in the parish.

The term refers to a local church community or territory, including its main church building, and other property. The word 'parish' is also used more generally to refer to the collection of people who attend a particular church. In this usage, a parish minister is one who serves a congregation.

A parish is a subdivision of a diocese or 'see'. The diocese is headed by a Bishop

In some countries a civil parish is an administrative area of civil government. Usually they started as an church parish of the same name. In the course of time, perhaps with modified boundaries to better suit local government, the parish survives.

Runnymede

Runnmede is a water-meadow in Surrey, England, 20 miles (32 km) west of London. The site is owned and managed by The National Trust, and runs alonside the River Thames. It is one of England's most visited tourist sites.

Runnymede is where King John signed the Magna Carta in 1215. Over eight centuries later, the memorial for those of the Allied Air Forces who died in World War II was placed on Runnymede. Then the British memorial to John F. Kennedy was put there in 1965.

The name Runnymede may be derived from the Anglo-Saxon 'runieg' (regular meeting) and 'mede' (mead or meadow), describing a place in the meadows used to hold regular meetings. The Witan, the Saxon Council, was held from time to time at Runnymede during the reign of Alfred the Great. The Council met usually in the open air. This tradition influenced the creation of England’s parliament in the 13th century.

Visitors reach the memorial by treading a steep path of irregular granite steps, intended to symbolise a pilgrimage. There are 50 steps in total. Each step is different to all others, with the entire flight made from 60,000 hand-cut granite blocks. Landscape architect Geoffrey Jellicoe designed the garden; sculptor Alan Collins designed and carved the stone inscription.
The area of ground on which the memorial is situated was given as a gift to the United States of America by the people of Britain. It is maintained by the Kennedy Memorial Trust, which also sponsors educational scholarships for British students to attend university in the United States.

In 1968 the 7-ton stone was damaged by a bomb during a time of anti-Vietnam war demonstrations; it was later repaired by the sculptor.

Chris Columbus (filmmaker)

Chris Joseph Columbus (born September 10, 1958) is an American movie director, producer and screenwriter. His most successful films are "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", "Mrs. Doubtfire", and "Home Alone".

Columbus was born in Spangler, Pennsylvania and raised in Youngstown, Ohio. He is the son of Mary Irene (née Puskar) and Alex Michael Columbus. Columbus is of Italian and Czech descent. He graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Warren, Ohio and from New York University's film school at the Tisch School of the Arts. 

Columbus worked as a screenwriter with Steven Spielberg's Amblin Productions, working on "Gremlins" (1984), "The Goonies" (1985) and "Young Sherlock Holmes" (1985). He wrote the first episodes of the animated series "Galaxy High" (1986) and later made his directorial debut with the teen comedy "Adventures in Babysitting" (1987) and "Heartbreak Hotel" (1988).

His directorial work includes "Home Alone" (1990), "Only the Lonely" (1991), "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992), "Mrs. Doubtfire" (1993), "Nine Months" (1995), "Stepmom" (1998), "Bicentennial Man" (1999), "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" (2001), "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" (2002), "Rent" (2005), "I Love You Beth Cooper" (2009) and "" (2010).

Columbus founded his production company named 1492 Pictures in 1995, intended as a play to Columbus's more famous namesake, Christopher Columbus.

The character types preferred by Columbus are the everyday American men, women and children who struggle to uphold family traditions against a changing, sometimes intimidating (scary) society. In 1993 he said: "I can understand the validity of showing people the ugliness of the world, but I also think there is a place for movies to leave people with a sense of hope. If your film isn't going to do that, I just don't think it's worth making."

Columbus married Monica Devereux in 1983, with whom he had four children: Eleanor, Violet, Brendan, and Isabella. Columbus lives in San Francisco's Pacific Heights, where his children attend or previously attended Saint Ignatius College Preparatory. He donated money to the school for a new building, which is named after him.

Columbus's daughter Eleanor appeared as the character Susan Bones in the two Potter films he directed, making her one of only two Americans cast as students, along with cousin Robert Ayres (Boy in Study Hall #2 in his second "Harry Potter" film). She also appeared as an infant in "Home Alone" with her grandmother and had a small cameo along with her father in "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York".

Two of his other children, Violet and Brendan, appeared in unnamed cameo roles in "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets". Chris and his son also have an uncredited cameo in "Rent".

Violet Columbus also appeared in "I Love You, Beth Cooper", singing "Forget Me" at the very beginning of graduation and the entire movie itself.

His wife Monica Devereux made a small appearance in "Home Alone" as the red-headed flight attendant, and in "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" as the Plaza telephone operator.

His father-in-law appeared in "Home Alone" as a Chicago policeman who checks the McAllisters' home to see if Kevin is there.

Iron sulfide

Iron sulfide is a chemical compound. It is made of iron and sulfide ions. It has iron in its +2 oxidation state. It is found in the ground as the mineral pyrite. It is shiny like a metal, but it does not conduct electricity. It can make sparks when it is powdered (ground finely). It does not always contains sulfide ions; sometimes it contains a mixture of sulfide and sulfur. When it is exposed to oxygen in air, it forms acids which pollute streams and rivers. It reacts with acids such as hydrochloric acid to make hydrogen sulfide gas.

Important film in modern English/Australian Movie Culture. One of the great films of this decade, and it has won alot of awards. Currently a proposed VGA. So If somebody can just look over it make spelling/grammar/format/simplification changes as necessary to make sure it's ready for vote, that would be great. 13:24, 3 February 2008 (UTC)

I have extended the article quite a bit; I have also copied over sections of the English article, and simplified them. I think that some sections (mostly in Problems) could still be simplified further. Also, there are many references to movements within Christianity and different versions of the Bible and the Tanakh (which we do not have yet). I think it would be helpful if other editors could read over them, and fix the problems they see. -- () 12:13, 26 January 2008 (UTC)

I know that this request can be hard to do, as we have few active editors with an islamic background, and Islam-related fears tend to be high in some areas.. In particular I am thinking about Islam, Mosque and Muhammad. Muhammad is the best of them; it is a good article (though demotion was proposed ). Mosque needs a thorough copyediting and expansion, in my opinion. Like with Christian Churches, there are probably different architectural styles how to build a mosque; there are also certain parts of a mosque that don't change (carpets on the floor, niche towards Mecca...).

The above article was one which I had originally created on the English Wikipedia (from a one-sentence stub), and then copied over to this Wikipedia (on a user page) and then simplified.

Could other editors please look at it and let me know:

I'm looking for some help with this article. I started it a couple of days ago and am essentially finished and feel that it is relatively complete. The average readability score is 9.2, but I feel that may be due to the amount of quotes which cannot be simplified. Any comments on further improvements is greatly appreciated.

I'm looking for thoughts on Bobby Dodd. I transwikied this from the English Wikipedia and spent awhile tonight trying to simplify it. I believe it has the basis for a here. It is already a good article on the English Wikipedia, and I think it can fit our standards as well. Obviously there are a lot of red links to fill at this point. What are other thoughts right now in regards to prose and content, though?

I've been working on it for awhile, and when I'm done, I'm going to nom it for GA. Yes, I know has no references; they are coming, along with history since 1960. There are a few things I'd like some community input on before I'm done:

Complex words - you need to have a good look at the Basic English word list. This lists 850 simple words. These should be the basis of all your writing. You should only use a more complex word if it is really necessary. This is not easy to do and is part of what makes writing for this Wikipedia so interesting.

I think Conservatives in the United States is a good article. I lowered the reading level to 9th to 12th grade reading level. I also think it is at a neutral point of view based on the published sources. Maybe it's a very good article. Since it's about Conservatism in the United states, it should probably not include long passages on liberalism and radicalism. -- () 05:00, 28 November 2010 (UTC)

To represent this: 
And to represent 
...is an absolute outrage. Original passages from ref 44, and as 'simplified' in Conservatives in the United States#1950 to 1980s. Do look at these comparisons between the text and the originals. The refs have been used as a cover for contributor's own ideas. There is a case for blanking the page, and restarting. () 12:34, 16 December 2010 (UTC)

This page has been under review for a while. I made a proposal to replace the content with something more neutral. Other users have pointed out some problems with the article here and on the talk page. I looked at some of the articles in other languages and the page in Spanish seemed clear, simple, and neutral. It also matched the the title of the article. "Conservatives in the United States" seems to call for an article about people who are conservative. I added a gallery including the pictures of conservative figures that Chuck had organized. Too much? See ! () 01:22, 19 December 2010 (UTC)


This is how I read it. We have a list of Conservatives in the U.S. with an not-simple introductory paragraph (which could be discarded). We could keep this as a list; it would act as an informal guide to our biographies of those people. We need more biographies!

Also, we have a page Conservatism, which could be improved and expanded. We could explain the ideas of conservatism there. 

If people don't like this, then we have to go back to the enWP article, which has both theory and thumbnail biographies. This would not be easy to simplify, but it could be done. 

I am posting this here before applaying for GA. I believe it to meet all requirements for

Was very close to making GA or VGA a month or two ago. Probably could make it again if peer reviewed. In my opinion, is simple enough and covers all the relevant topics 18:57, 18 December 2010 (UTC)

I simplified this from the English Wikipedia. I explained the hard words in the text. If there are any words that you think need to be linked to Wiktionary, please link them. I included a link to the Main Page of Wiktionary so readers can look of words in another browser window. Maybe you will help get this article ready for the main page by adding a few links to other articles. () 06:39, 16 December 2010 (UTC)

I "discovered" this article a few days ago, and have since edited it heavily.It is currently about 18k in size, which should be enough to make a good article. The main problems I see so far is that referencing is currently non-existent, and that the EnWP article is similarly bad (in that respect). Parts of the article may also be hard to understand, simplifying here and there may be helpful. Anyway, I thought I'd list it. -- () 15:42, 6 September 2009 (UTC)

Part of a splurge on evolution-related articles for Simple. It seems to meet the criteria; the complexity has been deliberately restrained to topics that might be raised in school or beginning university courses. That might or might not meet approval. () 09:48, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

Diocese

A diocese is an area of land under the charge of a bishop. He looks after the religious needs of the Christians who live there. The bishop organises the work of the Church in the area, and is responsible for all the ministers (priests) in his area. Another word for diocese is see, or even 'episcopal see'.

The diocese is the key geographical unit of religious authority in the church. Archbishops have an archdiocese. Inside each diocese are a number of parishes. Each parish is the area supervised by a local priest, and is part of the diocese.

As the Western Roman Empire fell during the 5th and 6th centuries the bishops of the Church took over many of the administrative roles of the former Roman prefects. The areas of ecclesiastical administration always coincided with those of the Roman civil administration. 

A thousand years later, the Ottoman Empire conquered the Eastern Roman, or Byzantine Empire. The eastern bishops then continued as the Roman civil structure was stripped away. Many an ancient diocese, though later divided among several dioceses, preserved the boundaries of a long-vanished Roman administrative division.

Ammonium dichromate is a chemical compound. It is composed of ammonium and dichromate ions. Its chemical formula is NHCrO. It is a reddish crystalline solid. It is a weak acid. It is a strong oxidizing agent and can explode when heated in a closed container. This is because ammonium is a weak reducing agent, making a redox reaction. It is used in volcano demonstrations. It is poisonous because it contains dichromate, which is similar to chromate. It is a carcinogen. It is used in oxidation reactions. It is made by reacting chromic acid and ammonium hydroxide.

Potassium dichromate is a chemical compound. It contains potassium and dichromate ions. It has a chemical formula of KCrO. The chromium is in its +6 oxidation state.

It is a bright red crystalline solid. It is a strong oxidizing agent in acidic conditions. It is poisonous because it contains dichromate, which is carcinogenic. It can be destroyed by reaction with reducing agents. It can be reduced to green chromium(III) compounds such as chromium(III) oxide. 

Potassium dichromate can be made by oxidation of potassium hydroxide and chromium(III) oxide. It can also be made by adding an acid to potassium chromate. 

It is very rarely found in the earth. It is only found in very dry areas. If it rains, it dissolves in the water and is washed away.

It is used as a reagent for many chemicals, such as alcohol. Some breath alcohol testers use this, and the red turns to green when there is alcohol in the breath. It can be used to make chromic acid, which is used to clean glass. It can be used in cement. It is used to tan leather. It can be used in photography and to test for certain metals. It can be used to treat wood.

Potassium dichromate is very irritating. It can cause cancer when the dust is inhaled. It is a strong oxidizing agent and can start fires. It can be reacted with iron(II) sulfate to detoxify (remove the toxicity of) it.

It is a dark red crystalline solid. It is a strong oxidizing agent. It can ignite alcohol when it is mixed with it. It is very toxic and irritates skin. It is a stronger oxidizing agent than chromate. It dissolves in water to make chromic acid, which is acidic. It reacts with strong bases to make chromates. It gives off oxygen when heated and turns into chromium(III) oxide. 

It is normally made by reacting sodium chromate or potassium chromate with sulfuric acid. It can also be made by drying chromic acid. 

It is used to clean glass. It is also used to plate chromate on things. It reacts with metals to make a metal chromate which stops the metal from corroding. 

Chromium(VI) oxide is very toxic and irritating. It is a carcinogen and can cause mutations. It can be destroyed by reacting it with a reducing agent like ferrous sulfate. It is a dangerous hazard to the environment.

Erica is made the manager at the job site, but Gia persistently excoriates her when Erica appears to supervise, including after Erica takes the boss' advice to try a positive reinforcement, and when the boss tries to intervene, Gia quits. The girls who earned their $70 for the day are treated to a spa afternoon, except Chrissy who did not earn a paycheck. Gia earned $50 for a partial day's work.

At home, the fights between the girls escalated. At the group session, Gia openly admits she exploited her privileges, and that she has no regard for the others' feeling.

Muscle atrophy

Muscle atrophy or “muscle wastage” is a decrease in the mass of the muscle. It leads to muscle weakness, since the ability to exert force is related to mass. Muscle atrophy can be a partial or complete wasting away of muscle.
Muscular atrophy affects a major number of elderly. It also develops in several common diseases, including cancer, AIDS, congestive heart failure, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure. It may be observed in Dejerine Sottas syndrome, inactivity, as seen when a cast is put on a limb, or upon extended bed rest (which can occur during a prolonged illness or hostel research); cachexia, burns, liver failure and starvation. 
Muscular atrophy decreases quality of life as the sufferer becomes unable to perform certain tasks or worsen the risks of accidents while performing those (like walking). It also increases the risks of falling in conditions such as IBM (inclusion body myositis). 

The exact cause of muscular atrophy is unknown, but it may be due to the gradual failure in the "satellite cells" which help to regenerate skeletal muscle fibres, and a decrease in sensitivity to or the availability of secreted growth factors which are necessary to maintain muscle mass and satellite cell survival.

In muscle atrophy, the normal balance between protein synthesis and protein degradation changes. There is a down-regulation of protein synthesis pathways, and an activation of protein breakdown pathways. 
In the ATP-dependent ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, particular proteins are targeted for destruction by the ligation of at least four copies of a small peptide called ubiquitin onto a substrate protein. The substrate is later targeted for destruction by the proteasome. 

Muscle atrophy can be treated

The race was first held , and the last race was in . It is named the San Marino Grand Prix after the nearby republic of San Marino.

The area by Imola is home to several racing car manufacturers, including Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Maserati. Following the Second World War, the town started a project to improve the local economy. Four local motor racing fans suggested building a new road. The road would link together existing public roads. These road were used by the local car manufacturers to test their new car designs. Construction began in March 1950. The first test run took place two years later when Enzo Ferrari sent a car to the track.

In April 1953, the first motorcycle races took place at Imola, and the first car race took place in June 1954. In April 1963, the first race with Formula One cars took place at Imola. It was a non-championship event, and was won by Jim Clark for Lotus. An additional non-championship event took place at Imola in 1979. This race was won by Niki Lauda for Brabham-Alfa Romeo.

In 1980, the Italian Grand Prix moved from the high-speed Monza circuit to Imola. This was because of a bad crash in 1978. The crash killer the popular Swedish driver Ronnie Peterson. The 1980 race was won by Nelson Piquet for Brabham-Ford. In 1981 the Italian Grand Prix returned to Monza, and Imola hosted the new San Marino Grand Prix, named after the nearby republic of San Marino.

In there were three serious accidents at Imola. During the Friday practice, Rubens Barrichello hit the fence at the Variante Bassa. It was a very hard crash and he was knocked unconscious for a few minutes. During the qualifying session on Saturday, Roland Ratzenberger crashed at the Villeneuve Corner. He hit a concrete barrier wall almost head-on and was received a very bad head injury. He was taken to the hospital, but died from injuries. In the race on Sunday, Ayrton Senna hit a concrete wall at the high-speed Tamburello Corner. Senna was killed instantly. For the 1995 race, the Tamburello and Villeneuve corners were changed. They became slower chicanes. The Variante Bassa was also straightened. These crashes started changes at other Formula One circuits. Changes were made to make the sport safer.

Teams had complained about the poor quality of the facilities (buildings and work areas) at Imola. San Marino Grand Prix was dropped from the Formula One championship after . Part of the reason for dropping San Marino was there was another grand prix held in Italy.

Leopold von Sacher-Masoch

Leopold Ritter von Sacher-Masoch (27 January 1836 – 9 March 1895) was an Austrian writer and journalist, who became famous for his romantic stories about Galician life. The word masochism comes from his name.

During his lifetime, Sacher-Masoch was known as a thinker who supported socialist and humanist ideas in his writing, both his stories and his letters. Most of his works have not been translated into English. The novel "Venus in Furs" is the only one of his books that can be commonly found in English.

Von Sacher-Masoch was born in what is now Lviv, Ukraine. His father was a Austrian police director with Spanish ancestry, and his mother was Charlotte von Masoch, a Ukrainian noblewoman. He began learning German at age 12. He studied law, history and mathematics at Graz University. After he finished his study, Sacher-Masoch moved back to Lemberg where he became a professor. His early writing was mainly non-fiction works about Austrian history. At the same time, Sacher-Masoch began looking into the stories of his homeland, Galicia. Soon he stopped lecturing to write stories and letters. Within ten years, his short stories and novels became more famous than his historical non-fiction works, though his fiction had history in it.

Sacher-Masoch was especially interested in capturing stories of the different ethnicities that lived in Galicia. From the 1860s to the 1880s, he collected many volumes of "Jewish Short Stories", "Polish Short Stories", "Galician Short Stories", "German Court Stories" and "Russian Court Stories". His works were translated into Ukrainian, Russian and French. They were very popular in Ukraine.

In 1869 Sacher-Masoch wrote a large number of short stories under the group title "Legacy of Cain". These stories showed his view on life and the world. Six volumes were planned, but only the first two were ever completed. By the middle of the 1880s, Masoch had abandoned the "Legacy of Cain". Despite this, the published volumes of the series included his best-known stories, including "Venus in Furs" (1869) which is the most famous today. The short novel expressed Sacher-Masoch's fantasies and fetishes, which he tried to live out with his mistresses and wives.

Sacher-Masoch edited the monthly literary magazine "Auf der Höhe. Internationale Review" ("At the Pinnacle. International Review"), which was published in Leipzig from October, 1881 to September, 1885. This was a magazine aimed at helping Jews in Saxony become part of the community, as well supporting women's rights with articles on women's education and suffrage.

In his later years, he worked against local antisemitism through an association called the Oberhessischer Verein für Volksbildung (OVV), which he founded in 1893 with his second wife, Hulda Meister.

Sunshine Coast, Queensland

The Sunshine Coast (population 312,908) is a coastal region in South East Queensland, north of the Queensland capital of Brisbane. On 15th March 2008, the former Councils of Noosa Shire, Maroochy Shire and Caloundra City combined to form the Sunshine Coast Regional Council. 

The Sunshine Coast is bordered by the Pacific Ocean in the east, and extends to the local government boundaries beyond the Blackall Range to the west. Sometimes, the towns of Gympie, which is 30 minutes' drive north of Noosa Heads, and Caboolture, 30 minutes' drive south of Caloundra, have been included in a broader definition of the Sunshine Coast region.

The Glass House Mountains, located south-west of Caloundra, were first sighted by James Cook from the deck of the HM Bark Endeavour in 1770.

The Sunshine Coast's first white inhabitants were three castaways who shared the life of the aborigines for eight months. Later it became the home of many runaway convicts. It was also the scene of some of the most bitter skirmishes of Australia's Black War.

Timber-getters used its rivers and lakes as seaways to float out logs of cedar, and prospectors climbed its mountains to reach the Gympie gold. With the coming of the railway line to Gympie, the coastal towns, which were founded as ports for the early river trade, were bypassed. The Sunshine Coast later grew into a holiday destination, which was further expanded in the development boom of the 1960s and 1970s. 

The Sunshine Coast is a centre for tourism. The attractions include: Steve Irwin's Australia Zoo, UnderWater World marine park, Aussie World with the Ettamogah Pub, The Buderim Ginger Factory, The Big Pineapple and the Majestic Theatre at Pomona.

The Sunshine Coast contains many beaches. Many well-known beaches within the Sunshine Coast region are located at Noosa Heads, Alexandra Headland, Mooloolaba (the spit), Coolum, Maroochydore and Kings Beach in Caloundra.

The region is also home to more national parks than any other region in Queensland. The natural variety of the area has been protected by five separate parks in both coastal and inland regions, including Mapleton Falls National Park, Kondalilla National Park, The Glasshouse Mountains National Park, Noosa National Park, and the Great Sandy National Park, which includes sections on Fraser Island and in Cooloola near Rainbow Beach.

Robert Frost

Robert Lee Frost (March 26, 1874 – January 29, 1963) was an American poet. He is well known for his realistic writings of rural life and his command of American informal (slang) speech. His work frequently employed settings from rural life in New England in the early twentieth century, using them to examine complex social and philosophical themes. A popular and often-quoted poet, Frost was honored often during his lifetime, receiving four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry.

Robert Frost was born in San Francisco, California, to journalist William Prescott Frost, Jr., and Isabelle Moodie.

Frost's father was a teacher and later an editor of the "San Francisco Evening Bulletin" (later the "San Francisco Examiner"), and an unsuccessful candidate for city tax collector. After his death on May 5, 1885 the family moved across the country to Lawrence, Massachusetts. Frost graduated from Lawrence High School in 1892. Frost's mother joined the Swedenborgian church and had him baptized in it, but he left the church as an adult. 

Although known for his later understanding of rural life, Frost grew up in the city, and published his first poem in his high school's magazine. He attended Dartmouth College for two months, long enough to be accepted into the Theta Delta Chi fraternity. Frost returned home to teach and to work at various jobs.

In 1894 he sold his first poem, "My Butterfly: An Elegy" (published in the November 8, 1894, edition of the "New York Independent") for fifteen dollars. Proud of this accomplishment, he proposed marriage to Elinor Miriam White, but she waited, wanting to finish college before they married. Frost then went on a trip to the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia, and asked Elinor again upon his return. Having graduated, she agreed and they were married.

He attended liberal arts studies at Harvard for two years, but left to support his growing family. Shortly before dying, Robert's grandfather purchased a farm for Robert and Elinor in Derry, New Hampshire; and Robert worked the farm for nine years, while writing early in the mornings and producing many of the poems that would later become famous. His farming was unsuccessful and he returned to education as an English teacher at New Hampshire's Pinkerton Academy from 1906 to 1911, then at the New Hampshire Normal School (now Plymouth State University) in Plymouth, New Hampshire.

In 1912 Frost sailed with his family to Great Britain, living first in Glasgow before settling in Beaconsfield outside London. His first book of poetry, "A Boy's Will", was published the next year. In England he made some important friends, including Edward Thomas (a member of the group known as the Dymock Poets), T.E. Hulme, and Ezra Pound. Surrounded by his peers, Frost wrote some of his best work while in England.

As World War I began, Frost returned to America in 1915 and bought a farm in New Hampshire, where he started a career of writing, teaching, and lecturing. This family homestead served as the Frosts' summer home until 1938, and is used today as The Frost Place, a museum and poetry conference site. During the years 1916–20, 1923–24, and 1927–1938, Frost taught English at Amherst College in Massachusetts, notably encouraging his students to account for the sounds of the human voice in their writing.

For forty-two years – from 1921 to 1963 - Frost spent almost every summer and fall teaching at the Bread Loaf School of English of Middlebury College, at its mountain campus at Ripton, Vermont. The college now owns and maintains his former Ripton farmstead as a national historic site near the Bread Loaf campus. In 1921 Frost accepted a fellowship teaching post at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where he resided until 1927; while there he was awarded a lifetime appointment at the University as a Fellow in Letters. The Robert Frost Ann Arbor home is now situated at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. Frost returned to Amherst in 1927. In 1940 he bought a plot in South Miami, Florida, naming it "Pencil Pines"; he spent his winters there for the rest of his life.

Harvard's 1965 alumni directory indicates Frost received an honorary degree there. Although he never graduated from college, Frost received over 40 honorary degrees, including ones from Princeton, Oxford and Cambridge universities; and was the only person to receive two honorary degrees from Dartmouth College. During his lifetime, the Robert Frost Middle School in Fairfax, Virginia, and the main library of Amherst College were named after him.

Frost was 86 when he spoke and performed a reading of his poetry at the inauguration of President John F. Kennedy on January 20, 1961. He died in Boston two years later, on January 29, 1963, of complications from prostate surgery. He was buried at the Old Bennington Cemetery in Bennington, Vermont. His epitaph quotes a line from one of his poems: "I had a lover's quarrel with the world."

Frost's poems are analyzed in the "Anthology of Modern American Poetry" (Oxford University Press) where it is mentioned that behind a sometimes charmingly familiar and rural front, Frost's poetry frequently presents hopeless and hostile undertones which often are either unseen or unanalyzed.

One of the original collections of Frost materials is found in the Special Collections department of the Jones Library in Amherst, Massachusetts. The collection consists of approximately twelve thousand items, including original manuscript poems and letters, correspondence, and photographs, as well as audio and visual recordings.

Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari

The Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari is an auto racing circuit near the Italian town of Imola, east of Bologna and east of the Ferrari factory in Maranello. Often, it is simply called Imola.

The circuit is named after Ferrari's late founder Enzo, and his son Dino who had died in the 1950s. Before Enzo Ferrari's death in 1988 it was called 'Autodromo Dino Ferrari'.

It was the host for the Formula One San Marino Grand Prix. The Italian Grand Prix has been held in Italy since the start of Formula One. The race at Imola was named after the nearby Republic of San Marion. After a bad crash Monza in , Imola hosted the Italian Grand Prix. When Formula One visits Imola, it is considered the 'home circuit' of Ferrari and a large group of "tifosi" (Ferrari supporters) come out to support the local team.

Imola is one of the few major international circuits to run in an anti-clockwise (counter-clockwise) direction. Other anti-clockwise circuits include Istanbul Park, Singapore's Marina Bay, Autódromo José Carlos Pace, and Yas Marina Circuit.

Even with the addition of the chicanes, safety was a concern at the circuit. One of the biggest worries was the high-speed, flat-out "Tamburello" corner. Tamburello was very bumpy and had very little room between the track and a concrete wall. The wall protected a creek that ran behind the corner. In San Marino Grand Prix, Nelson Piquet had an accident at the corner during practice. He missed the race due to his injuries. In the San Marino Grand Prix, Gerhard Berger crashed his Ferrari at Tamburello after the front wing broke. The crash was so heavy, the monocoque (the driver's compartment) split open. The car caught fire. The firefighters and medical personnel went to work quickly. Because of fast response, Berger survived with only burns on his hands. Berger only missed one race, the Monaco Grand Prix. Other drivers, including Michele Alboreto and Riccardo Patrese also bad crashes at Tamburello corner. They escaped without serious injury.
In there were three serious accidents at Imola. During the Friday practice, Rubens Barrichello hit the fence at the Variante Bassa. It was a very hard crash and he was knocked unconscious for a few minutes. During the qualifying session on Saturday, Austrian Roland Ratzenberger crashed at the Villeneuve Corner. He hit a concrete barrier wall almost head-on and was received a very bad head injury. He was taken to the hospital, but died from injuries. In the race on Sunday, 3-time World Champion Ayrton Senna hit a concrete wall at Tamburello Corner. Senna was killed instantly. In two unrelated accidents, several spectators and mechanics were also injured during the race.

In response to the deaths of Ratzenberger and Senna, changes were made to try to make the circuit safer. The flat-out Tamburello corner was reduced in speed. It was also made into a left-right sweeper. A gravel trap was added to the limited space on the outside of the corner. Villeneuve corner was also slowed down and a gravel trap added. To retain some of the character of the old circuit, the slow chicane at Acqua Minerale was eliminated. Many say that the new circuit configuration is not as good as it used to be as a result of the new chicanes at Tamburello and Villeneuve.

Another modification made was to the Variante Alta. Variante Alta is at the top of the hill leading down to Rivazza. It has the hardest braking point on the lap. The kerbs were very high, and the drivers often hit them. This often caused damage to the cars and sometimes lead to accidents. Before the 2006 Grand Prix, the kerbs were lowered and the turn itself was tightened to reduce speeds.

Some had complained about the poor quality of the facilities (buildings and work areas) at Imola. San Marino Grand Prix was dropped from the Formula One championship after .

Following an FIA decision in August 2006, Imola did not host a Grand Prix in . SAGIS is the company that owns the circuit. They hoped that the race would be reinstated at the October 2006 meeting of the FIA World Motorsport Council. They were planning renovations to the facility, but the reinstatement was denied.
The circuit has undergone major revisions. The pitlane, pit garages and the final corners have been updated. The final left-right chicane has been removed. The run from Rivazza 2 to the first Tamburello chicane is flat-out. This is more like the old version of the circuit. The pitlane has been extended and reworked. The old pit garages and paddock have been completely rebuilt. The circuit hopes to rejoin the F1 calendar within the next few seasons. The reconstruction has been designed by German track architect Hermann Tilke.

In June 2008, with most of the reconstruction work done, FIA gave the track "1T" rating, meaning that an official F1 test can be held there. But still the track needs the "1" approvial to again host a Formula One race. The track also hosted the 2008 World Touring Car Championship Race of Europe, on September 21, 2008.

<doc id="260604" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=260604" title="Elastic collision">
Elastic collision

An elastic collision is when two objects collide and bounce back with little or none deformation. For example, two rubber balls bouncing together would be elastic. Two cars hitting each other would be inelastic, as the cars crumple, and do not bounce back. In a perfectly elastic collision (the simplest case), no kinetic energy is lost, and so the kinetic energy of the two objects after the collision is equal to their total kinetic energy before the collision. Elastic collisions occur only if there is no net conversion of kinetic energy into other forms (heat, sound). The other rule to remember when working with elastic collisions is that momentum is conserved.

Consider two particles, indicated by subscripts 1 and 2. Let "m" and "m" be the masses, "u" and "u" be the velocities before the collision and "v" and "v" be the velocities after collision.
Since it is an elastic collusion, the total momentum before the collision is the same as the total momentum after the collision.
Given that momentum (p) is calculated as
We can calculate the momentum before the collision to be:
and the momentum after the collision to be:
Setting the two equal gives us our first equation:

The second rule we use is that the total kinetic energy remains the same, meaning that the initial kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy.

The formula for kinetic energy is:
So, using the same variables as before: 
The initial kinetic energy is:
The final kinetic energy is:
Setting the two to be equal ( since the total kinetic energy remains the same):

These equations may be solved directly to find "v" when "u" are known or vice versa.
Here is a sample problem, which can be solved using either conservation of momentum, or conservation of energy:

For example:

After collision:

Using Conservation of Momentum:

After doing multiplication, and then subtracting formula_11 from both sides, we get:

Summing the left side, then dividing by formula_13 gives us:

We could have also solved this problem using Conservation of Energy:

Multiplying both sides by formula_18, and then do all the required multiplications gives us:
Adding the numbers on the left, subtracting formula_20 from both sides, and dividing by formula_13 gives us:
Taking the square root of both sides gives us an answer of formula_23.

Unfortunately, we'd still need to use conservation of momentum to figure out whether formula_24 is positive or negative.

Don't Bother Me

"Don't Bother Me" is the first song written by George Harrison to appear on an album by The Beatles. It was on the group's "With the Beatles" album in the UK, released in 1963, and on their "Meet the Beatles!" album in the U.S., released in 1964.

Harrison wrote the song while sick in bed at a hotel room in Bournemouth, England, where the Beatles were playing some shows during the summer of 1963. Harrison never regarded it highly, saying, "It was a fairly crappy song. I forgot all about it completely once it was on the album." He considered it an exercise in whether he could write a song, later saying, "at least it showed me that all I needed to do was keep on writing, and then maybe eventually I would write something good." Harrison received a writing credit for two earlier songs, "In Spite of All the Danger" (McCartney/Harrison) and "Cry for a Shadow" (Harrison/Lennon). Both were recorded by the Beatles but neither was released officially by the band until 1995's "Anthology 1" compilation. "Don't Bother Me" is considered Harrison's first song by most (including the composer himself).

The sullen mood and sad lyrics—"So go away, leave me alone, don't bother me"—were unusual for the Beatles at the time but would become characteristic for Harrison. The song mostly stays in a minor key and achieves a thick sound through its double-tracked vocal, reverbed guitars, and busy drumming. The elaborate percussion lends the song a Latin rhythm accentuated by its stop-time structure.

The Beatles recorded the song on 11 and 12 September 1963. They were not satisfied with the version recorded on the 11th and did a remake on the 12th.

"Don't Bother Me" is one of several songs featured in "A Hard Day's Night", during a scene where the Beatles dance at a nightclub while McCartney's grandfather gambles elsewhere. At the end of the film, it is noted as a Lennon/McCartney composition rather than a Harrison composition.

British singer Gregory Phillips released a version of "Don't Bother Me" as his third single. Though unsuccessful, this was the first cover version of a Harrison composition.

<doc id="260666" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=260666" title="Tony Miles">
Tony Miles

Tony Miles (Anthony John Miles, Birmingham, 23 April 1955 – Birmingham, 12 November 2001) was an English chess Grandmaster.
In 1973 Miles won the silver medal at the World Junior Chess Championship at Teesside, his first important event against international competition. He won the title next year in Manila.

Miles entered the University of Sheffield to study mathematics, but dropped out to concentrate on chess.

In 1976, Miles became the first ever FIDE Grandmaster born in the United Kingdom, narrowly beating Raymond Keene to the title. Other English players had been acknowledged as true Grandmasters in the past. Howard Staunton, the 19th century World Champion, was obviously a grandmaster. Joseph Blackburne was also regularly described as a grandmaster. Naturalised German-born Jacques Mieses was awarded the GM title in 1950; and Jonathan Penrose was awarded the title retrospectively. For his achievement, Miles won a £5,000 prize.

Miles had a string of good results in the late 1970s and 1980s, and his success was a factor in the growth of strong British players around that time—shortly after Miles became a GM. Miles won games against a number of former World Chess Champions, including Vasily Smyslov, Mikhail Tal, and Boris Spassky. In 1980 at the European Team Championship in Skara, he beat reigning world champion Anatoly Karpov with black using the extremely unorthodox opening 1. e4 a6!?, the so-called English Defence. Miles beat Karpov again three years later in Bath in a game that was part of the BBC's "Mastergame" series, but it was never shown on television due to a technicians' strike. However, over their careers, Karpov won most of the other encounters.

Miles won the British Chess Championship only once, in 1982. His prime time as a chess player was in the middle of the eighties. In the January 1984 FIDE rating system, he ranked #18 in the world with a rating of 2599. One of his best (and most controversial) results was his win at the Tilburg tournament in 1984. The following year, he tied for first there with Robert Hübner and Viktor Korchnoi, playing several of his games while lying face-down on a table, having injured his back. 

Playing on top board for England, Miles helped his team to an all-time best silver medal at the 1986 Chess Olympiad in Dubai. But he was never able to qualify for the Candidates' series for the world title, and was overtaken by fellow Englishman Nigel Short in 1985.

Against Garry Kasparov Miles had little success, not winning a game against him, and losing a 1986 match in Basel against him by the overwhelming score of 5.5–0.5. Following this encounter, Miles described Kasparov as a "monster with a thousand eyes who sees all".

After he was hospitalized because of a mental breakdown in late 1987, Miles moved to the United States. He finished last in the 1988 US Championship, but continued to play there and had some good results. In 1991, he played in the Championship of Australia, but he eventually moved back to England, and began to represent his home country again. He was equal first at the very strong Cappelle-la-Grande Open in 1994, 1995 and 1997. He also won the Capablanca Memorial in Cuba three times (1995, 1996, and 1999). His last tournament victory was the 2001 Canadian Open Chess Championship in Sackville, New Brunswick.

Miles played in the 2001 British Championship, but withdrew before the final round, apparently because of ill-health. 

The "Miles Variation" (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 b6 4.Bf4) in the Queen's Indian Defence is named after him.

In his later years, Miles became grossly overweight, and suffered from diabetes. A post mortem found that this contributed to his death by heart failure.

Miles was in many ways a controversial figure. Miles had his disagreements with chess authorities and with his fellow English players, particularly Keene and Short. Miles made accusations regarding payments that Keene had received from the British Chess Federation for acting as his second (assistant) in the 1985 Interzonal tournament in Tunis. Miles became rather obsessed with the affair, eventually suffering a mental breakdown over it. He was arrested in September 1987 in Downing Street, apparently under the belief that he had to speak to then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher about the matter. He was subsequently hospitalised for two months. Writing in the Daily Telegraph in November 2003, Nigel Short claimed that "Tony was insanely jealous of my success, and his inability to accept that he was no longer Britain's number one was an indication of, if not a trigger for, his descent into madness".

Miles was also noted for his acerbic wit. He often attacked chess personalities in published articles. He attacked former World Champion Anatoly Karpov in an article entitled "Has Karpov Lost his Marbles?".

<doc id="260745" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=260745" title="Deepwater Horizon oil spill">
Deepwater Horizon oil spill

The "Deepwater Horizon" oil spill (also called the BP oil spill, the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the BP oil disaster or the Macondo blowout) was an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. It was the largest marine oil spill in history. The spill was caused by an oil gusher when the drilling machines exploded on April 20, 2010. The explosion killed 11 workers and hurt 17 more. The first tries to fix the leak did not work. On July 15, the leak was stopped by putting a cap on top of the broken well pipe. About 4.9 million barrels (780×10 m) of crude oil spilled out before the well was fixed. The amount of oil coming out of the broken well probably started at about 62,000 barrels per day (9,900 m/d) and gradually went down after that.

The spill damaged animal and plant habitats as well as the Gulf's fishing and tourism businesses. Scientists also found oil underwater that could not be seen from the top. People worked to protect hundreds of miles of beaches, wetlands, and estuaries along the northern Gulf coast. The U.S. Government has named British Petroleum (BP) as responsible. The company has paid for cleaning up and other damage. By the end of 2010, the U.S. Coast Guard’s Operational Scientific Advisory Team said that there were no more ocean areas needing special cleanup from the oil spill. They were not sure of the condition of the shore.
On May 27, 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama temporarily stopped new drilling for offshore oil rigs. He also made new safety rules to try to stop other oil spills from happening. British Petroleum (BP Oil) owned the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. This company was mostly responsible for the damage caused by the oil spill. They paid out several billion dollars to help people who could not work after the oil spill and to pay for cleanup efforts.

On May 3, 2010, The Gulf Coast Claims Center began to pay for emergency help to businesses and people (such as fishermen) who could not work because of the oil spill. By the end of August, 2010, The Gulf Coast Claims Center had paid more than $395 million. About one third of this money was paid to the fishing industry. A By February, 2011, the GCCF had paid about $751 million to people in the business of fishing. People will have three years to figure their costs and ask GCCF for payment.

BP also started a program, called the Vessels of Opportunity Program, to hire local people (who would have been fishing) to use their boats to help clean up the spilled oil. However the program made little or no impact on the spill as the vessels were not fitted with recovery equipment. 

There are more ways for those in the U.S. fishing industry to get paid back for money they lost because of the Gulf oil spill. For example, the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund was started after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill to help people hurt by oil spills. Another law, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act lets the U.S. government give help when the Secretary of Commerce sees that all the fishing has failed in one place.

 On May 2, 2010, 12 days after the blow up and fire of the Deepwater Horizon, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) closed 6,817 square miles of the Gulf of Mexico to fishing. The reason was to make sure that seafood that might be poisoned by the oil would not be sold and maybe make people sick. The U.S. government closed large areas to fishing from the middle of the Atchafalaya Bay of Louisiana, across the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama, and as far as Panama City in Florida. State waters were also closed to fishing in much of the same area. The largest area closed to fishing was 88,522 sq. miles (229,270 km) on June 2, 2010. By the end of November, 2010, most of the waters were opened to fishing again, with only 1041 sq miles (2697 km) still closed. However, there was still some oil residue to be found. For example, tar balls were sometimes found in shrimper’s nets. 

Some animals and plants were hurt by the Gulf oil spill. Scientists found dead, oil-covered animals such as birds, fish, shrimp, and oysters. Large, decaying fish covered in the thick, dark oil washed up on some beaches. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) found 1,746 birds. 1,014 of these birds had oil on them, 997 were dead, and 749 were alive. The NOAA also found 528 sea turtles, with 400 dead, and 128 alive. The NOAA found 51 mammals, including dolphins, with 47 dead and 4 alive. Some scientists cut open dead fish to look at the inside and found the oil was inside the gills and the heart. 

Because fishing was stopped, many small fishing supply stores could not make money. The fishing companies did not have enough fish and lost customers. Normally, lots of people travel to this area to fish for fun. Because of the oil spill, fewer people traveled there. Therefore, travel businesses and people who help the visitors also lost money.

East of Mobile Bay damage from oil spill cleanup crews and vehicles caused more damage to the fragile dune habitat than the oil spill itself. Dune habitats can be destroyed by nothing more than light foot traffic and in no way can support the egress of 100's of vehicles being deployed. Despite overwhelming supporting evidence, BP still denies this and apparently has persons editing and or reverting Wikipedia articles in order to cover up collateral problems associated with the accident.

Scientists have thought about how much the plants and animals in the Gulf of Mexico would be changed after the oil spill. In general, chemicals in oil can hurt fish and shellfish. In the early life stages, many kinds of fish grow near the shore. Therefore, oil at the shore might change how many fish there are in future years. Also, affected species are part of a food web or provide living areas for other kinds. These things are possible, but there are not yet many actual data of how the fish and shellfish are doing after the oil spill. Most of the shrimp grow in one year. Therefore, changes in the number of shrimp caused by the Gulf oil spill will be known one or two years after the spill. It takes years for many kinds of fish to grow large enough to keep for food. Therefore, it will take years to know the effects of the Gulf oil spill on the very small fish.

The NOAA is still helping animals hurt by the Gulf oil spill. However, not many more are being reported. Instead, the NOAA is spending more time letting wildlife go back into the ocean. For example, sea turtles that were saved from the oil are being let back into the wild ocean. NOAA scientists on research boats have also been measuring whether it is now safe to eat fish from the Gulf (they have found that it is safe). 

Counting done by Dauphin Island Sea Lab after the oil spill off the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama found that there were actually more of some kinds of fish a few months after the oil spill. Some scientists think that the closing of fishing areas kept the total number of fish high in spite of the oil spill.

One-third of the oysters sold in the United States come from Louisiana. However, the places where oysters grow have been hurt by recent hurricanes, higher than usual amounts of fresh water coming down the rivers (oysters need salt water) and also the Gulf oil spill. The Louisiana Division of Wildlife and Fisheries have been working with scientists at universities on better ways to grow oysters. Also, in June, 2011, more than 100 million oyster seeds and 500,000 baby oysters were put in test areas to help the oyster areas to grow back.

The US National Marine Fisheries Service thinks that the 2011 brown shrimp harvest from waters off of Mississippi and Louisiana will be only a little bit lower than usual. It is expected to be a much better harvest than in 2010 after the oil spill. Weather in the spring of 2011 was good for growing conditions for the brown shrimp.

Lithium hydroxide

Lithium hydroxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is LiOH. It contains lithium and hydroxide ions. 

Lithium hydroxide is a white solid. It can be anhydrous (without extra water molecules attached) or hydrated (water added to it). It dissolves in water to make a basic solution. It reacts with acids to make lithium salts. 

Lithium hydroxide is made by reacting lithium carbonate with calcium hydroxide. A calcium carbonate solid is made and a lithium hydroxide solution is left behind. It can also be made by reacting lithium with water or by reacting lithium oxide with water. 

It is used in spaceships to absorb carbon dioxide. It reacts with carbon dioxide to make lithium carbonate. This prevents people from suffocating in a spaceship. Lithium hydroxide is used to make lithium greases. They are resistant to water and can be used in high or low temperatures. It is used to transfer heat. It can be used in electrolytes. It is also used to prevent corrosion in some nuclear reactors. It can be used to glaze ceramics and make cement.

Lithium hydroxide is corrosive, like the other alkali metal hydroxides. It is also a little toxic because it has lithium in it. It can burn skin.

<doc id="260793" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=260793" title="The Four Stages of Cruelty">
The Four Stages of Cruelty

The Four Stages of Cruelty is a series of four printed engravings. They were published by the English artist William Hogarth in 1751. Every print is about a different part of life of Tom Nero, a fictional (not real) character.

The "First stage of Cruelty" shows Nero, when he is a child, hurting a dog. In the "Second stage of cruelty", Nero, who is an adult, beats his horse. Then in "Cruelty in perfection", he becomes a robber and murders his pregnant lover. At last, in "The reward of cruelty", his body is taken from the gallows after he is execution and is cut up into pieces by surgeons.

William Hogarth, who had been very unhappy at the acts of cruelty that he saw on the streets of London, printed the pictures for moral learning. They were printed on cheap paper for poor people. The pictures are rougher and more violent than Hogarth's other works, which usually have touches of humor. He had felt he needed to do this to make people understand his message. However, the pictures still have the small, careful details that Hogarth is famous for.

Like most of his other prints, such as "Beer Street" and "Gin Lane", Hogarth wanted "The Four Stages of Cruelty" to be a warning against cruel and evil acts, and that it was easy for a small bully to become a criminal. He wished to stop "that barbarous (mean) treatment of animals, the very sight of which renders (makes) the streets of our metropolis so distressing (terrible) to every feeling mind". Hogarth loved animals. When he painted a portrait of himself, he included his pug in the picture. He also marked the graves of his dogs and birds at his home in Chiswick.

Hogarth was pleased with his pictures. "European Magazine" reported that he said to a person who sold books named Mr. Sewell:

In his unfinished "Apology for Painters" he added:
In his 1817 book "Shakespeare and His Times", Nathan Drake said that picture in the first plate changed the opinion of people about "throwing at cocks", and encouraged them to be firmer about stopping the people who did these things.

Some people, however, did not like the series very much. Charles Lamb said that the series were not as good as Hogarth's other works. Art historian Allan Cunningham also disliked the series:

Joseph Henry Blackburne (Manchester, 10 December 1841 – London, 1 September 1924), nicknamed 'The Black Death', was the leading British chess Grandmaster during the later part of the 19th century. 

Blackburne learned the game at the relatively late age of 18 but quickly became a strong player. He went on to develop a professional chess career that spanned over 50 years. At one point he was the world's second most successful player, with a string of tournament victories behind him. Blackburne especially enjoyed giving simultaneous and blindfold displays around the country. Blackburne also annotated a collection of his own games (explained the moves), and was a chess correspondent for a leading journal until his death.

Blackburne was fond of Scotch whisky, and often drank during a display. He once drank his opponent's glass, and said: "He left it "en prise", and I took it "en passant!"" Much loved, he was supported by subscriptions from his fans in his last years.

Partner

A partner is someone who shares some action with someone else.

A partner may be somebody who lives with another person, e.g. a husband or wife (marriage partners), or a very good friend who shares his or her life with the other person. The word partner in this sense is used a lot in modern times because it does not discriminate between married or unmarried couples, or between gay and straight couples.

Partners may also be business partners: two people who both own a business together and work together.

The word partner can be used in other senses, e.g. dancing partners (two people who dance together) or partners at a card games such as bridge in which partners work together against the other partners (their opponents).

A stile is a simple wooden structure which helps people to climb over a fence in the countryside. Where there is a footpath (a right of way) which goes through a field with animals, there may be a stile so that walkers can climb over out of the field. The stile is there instead of a gate. If there were a gate and there were animals in the field, the animals could escape if the gate were left open. Stiles are, of course, a problem for people who are disabled.

There are many stiles in the countryside in the United Kingdom. Another way of letting walkers through but keeping animals in is to use a kissing gate.

Behaviorism

Behaviorism or Behaviourism is the theory that scientific enquiry into behaviour should consist only of what can be observed, such as stimuli and responses. Occult (hidden) qualities such as states of mind were expressly forbidden. Even though it is quite obvious that internal processes of thought go on in all advanced animals, certainly in man, this was not allowed to play any part in sychology because it could not be directly observed. 

Behaviourism says that behaviour can be studied scientifically, without knowing what the physiology of an event is, and without using theories such as that of the mind. According to behaviourism, all behaviour can be observed.

People who influenced behaviorism a great deal were Ivan Pavlov, Edward Lee Thorndike, John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner. 

Pavlov investigated classical conditioning, but did not agree with behaviourism or behaviorists. Thorndike and Watson rejected introspective methods and wanted to restrict psychology to experimental methods. Skinner's research focused on operant conditioning.

Today, ideas from behaviourism are used in therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. Cognitive-behaviotal therapy can help people cope with anxieties and phobias, as well as with certain forms of addiction. 

As a scientific theory, behaviorism was largely replaced by cognitive psychology.

Minardi

Minardi was an automobile racing team and constructor. It was founded in 1979 by Giancarlo Minardi. It competed in the Formula One World Championship from 1985 until 2005. The team was headquartered in Faenza, Italy. They had little success, but acquiring a loyal group of fans. In 2001 the team was nearly out of money, and was about to shut down. To save the team Mr. Minardi sold it to Australian businessman Paul Stoddart. Stoddart ran the team for five years. Then Stoddart sold the team to the energy drink company Red Bull in 2005. Red Bull renamed the team Scuderia Toro Rosso.

During its time in F1, the team scored a total of 38 championship points. 16 earned by the team's first driver, Pierluigi Martini. Martini also recorded the team's only front row start, 2nd at the United States Grand Prix. Martini led a lap in the Portuguese Grand Prix. The team never achieved a podium (top 3) finish. The best finishing position they managed was 4th place. Martini finished 4th twice in and Christian Fittipaldi in .

Before Minardi's demise, it was a well-liked team within Formula One circles. In the paddock, the team was known for it friendliness, accessibility, and lack of corporate culture. On the track, their cars were considered by many as well-designed for their tiny budget. They never had the money to spend compared to front-runners such as Ferrari and McLaren. Their low running position was a result of a lack of funds and engine power, rather than a poor car. They also resisted employing pay drivers more than most other teams short on money. Pay drivers are drivers who pay the team to drive the race car. Most professional race drivers are paid by a team to drive. Minardi produced an impressive list of former drivers. Two-time World Champion Fernando Alonso drove for them in . Former Minardi drivers who have gone on to win Grands Prix include Alessandro Nannini, Giancarlo Fisichella, Jarno Trulli and Mark Webber. Alex Zanardi, who drove as a substitute driver for Minardi in , went on to win two Champ Car titles. Justin Wilson and Christian Fittipaldi have also won races in premier North American open-wheel competition.

The Minardi family has a longstanding involvement in motorsport. The family has run a Fiat dealership since 1927. Giovanni Minardi competed in his own cars in the late 1940s. After his death, his son Giancarlo took over the racing part of the family business. He ran customer cars in Formula Two under various names from 1972 to 1979. Giancarlo briefly ran a customer Formula One Ferrari as Scuderia Everest in 1976. In 1979, he gaining financial backing Piero Mancini. Mancini was a well known Italian motor racing patron (supporter). This backing allowed Giancarlo to set up the Minardi racing team as a constructor.

The Minardi team first competed under that name in the 1980 European Formula Two championship. The team commissioned a BMW powered design from Giacomo Caliri's FLY studios. Caliri had earler build Fittipaldi Automotive team's F5A Formula One car. The Minardi team had four moderately successful Formula Two seasons with a variety of young drivers, including Alessandro Nannini and Johnny Cecotto. The team's most best result was a 1981 win at the Misano Circuit by Michele Alboreto. Minardi left the Formula Two division at the end of 1984. In 1986 a modified version of their final Formula Two car was entered in two rounds of the Formula 3000 championship. Formula 3000 had replaced Formula Two in 1985 Minardi did not have any success in Formula 3000.

During 1984, Minardi made the decision to enter Formula One the next year. Caliri designed the team's prototype Formula One car. The car was intended to be used for both Formula One and the new Formula 3000 series. The car was designed to use the Alfa Romeo's V8 turbocharged engine. When engineer Carlo Chiti left Alfa Romeo, he founded Motori Moderni. Minardi became the only customer for Chiti's new V6 engine design. The engine was not ready for the start of the , so the team converted their chassis, the M185. They used a Cosworth DFV V8 engine for the first two races. The single car team was unsuccessful in its first year. They did not score any points. The new engine was underpowered. Driver Pierluigi Martini finished only two races.. Martini's best was 8th place.

The team expanded to two cars for the season. They had little success competing with the Motori Moderni engine. In they started using the Cosworth engines. The team became more competitive. By had become top entrant for tyre maker Pirelli's return to Formula One. The team were moderately successful in the middle of the field through the late 1980s and early 1990s. Minardi gave a number of Italian drivers their first chance at the top level, including Alessandro Nannini, Pierluigi Martini and Gianni Morbidelli. Martini in especially tied with Minardi, driving for them three different times. He drove for them on their debut in . Scored their first point in the United States Grand Prix. Took their only front-row start at USA Grand Prix, aided by special Pirelli tyres. Led their only lap in the Portuguese Grand Prix. Martini was one of the drivers that scored Minardi F1 result of 4th place. 

Through the mid-1990s the team was at the beginning of the end of the Italian Formula One constructors. It was the first team in modern times to make use of customer engines. They used Ferrari engines in . In they switched to Lamborghini V12 engines. In they went to Ford engines. As the number of small teams shrank, Minardi slipped from the mid-field towards the back of the pack. The team was short on money. In Minardi joined his team with BMS Scuderia Italia in an effort to survive. The Minardi team was then controlled by Flavio Briatore. 

Gabriele Rumi was an Italian businessman and the former owner of the Fondmetal Formula One team. Rumi had been sponsoring Tyrrell. In Rumi switched his sponsorship support to Minardi. He became more interested in the team, and became the co-owner and chairman. For the season the team were forced to use 1998 specification Ford Zetec-R V10 engines, which were renamed as Fondmetal engines. Rumi had contracted cancer, and was forced to withdraw his backing in 2000. The team scored very few points in this era. Only seven points were scored, four of them by Martini. Michele Alboreto scored his last point in Formula One with a sixth place in the Monaco Grand Prix. Pedro Lamy scored his one and only point in Formula One with a sixth place in the Australian Grand Prix. 

The team, near financial collapse, was purchased by Australian businessman Paul Stoddart in early 2001. Stoddaart merged the team with his European Racing Formula 3000 team. During its final years, the Minardi team was almost as famous for its politics as its racing. Stoddart was described as the Formula One teams' unofficial representative. Stoddart tried to get the costs for the teams reduced. He asked to the other car manufacturers for help. He wanted an agreement where the independent teams in Formula One would get cheaper engine deals. In return, the teams that benefited from this deal would support the factory teams with the FIA. This would help the factory teams oppose new rule changes, such as the proposed ban on traction control. 

Before the start of the season, Stoddart threatened to support the ban on traction control. Later he withdrew this threat. Before the Australian Grand Prix Stoddart threatened to withdraw his cars. There were new regulation in place for 2005. He claimed that Minardi could not afford to modify their cars. Once again Stoddart ended up withdrawing his threat. Several times, Stoddart called for the resignation of Max Mosley, the FIA's President. 

One of Minardi's most famous performances came at the Australian Grand Prix. It was Australian driver Mark Webber's first Formula One race. At his and Stoddart's home grand prix, Webber brought the car home in fifth place finish. He scored two World Championship points, a rare occurrence for Minardi.

Minardi was represented in by two rookies, Italian Gianmaria "Gimmi" Bruni and Hungarian Zsolt Baumgartner. During the year, they celebrated their 20th season in F1. Baumgartner scored Minardi's first point in more than two years at the United States Grand Prix. Only eight cars finished the USGP, and Baumgartner finished 8th. Baumgartner was also the first Hungarian to score a point in a World Championship F1 race.

In , Minardi's drivers were Christijan Albers and Patrick Friesacher. They scored a total of 7 points, the most since the season. All of the points came from the debacle of the United States Grand Prix. They finished fifth and sixth. Only six cars started the race. None of the cars running Michelins started the race because of tyre problems. After Friesacher sponsors stopped paying him before the German Grand Prix, he was replaced by the Jordan test driver, Robert Doornbos. This created the first ever all-Dutch driver line-up in Formula One history.

Paul Stoddart stated that he would sell Minardi if he could find the right buyer. Stoddart said he had 41 offers to buy the team. His conditions for a sale was the ability of a buyer to move the team forward and leave the team based in Faenza. The drinks manufacturer Red Bull already owned one Formula One team, Red Bull Racing. They decided to set up a second team. They would promote American drivers through its young driver program, the Red Bull Driver Search. 

On 10 September 2005 Red Bull announced it would take control of Minardi in November and run it as their "rookie team" from . 

Minardi fans worldwide immediately started an online petition to save the Minardi team name and the team's 20-year heritage. The petition was not successful and the team was renamed Scuderia Toro Rosso for the 2006 season. The team's funding from Red Bull was increased. They started using the Red Bull chassis and Ferrari engines. Their results improved, and Toro Rosso scored their first win at the Italian Grand Prix.

Giancarlo Minardi and Paul Stoddart have both made use of the Minardi name in new motorsport ventures.

On 1 January 2006, Giancarlo Minardi re-acquired some rights to use the Minardi name in racing. He announced that he was licensing the Minardi name to an existing team GP Racing in the junior Euro Formula 3000 series, to be entitled 'Minardi Team by GP Racing'. The team raced with moderate success, scoring a podium in each leg of the Spa round in June 2006. For 2007, Minardi Team by GP Racing combined forces with GP2 team Piquet Sports, to form Minardi Piquet Sports. For 2008 the team is known simply as Piquet Sports.

In 2006, Paul Stoddart declared his intention to enter a new team called 'European Minardi F1 Team Ltd' into Formula One beginning in 2008. His application was unsuccessful, with the 12th place on the grid being awarded to Prodrive. Prodrive was unsuccessful in launching their F1 team. Stoddart turned his attentions to the U.S. based Champ Car series. On 18 December 2006, it was confirmed that he had purchased a controlling interest in the CTE Racing-HVM Champ Car team. The team would be renamed Minardi Team USA. In 2007, the team had some success. Robert Doornbos won two times and had several podium finishes. He finished third in the series, and won Rookie of the Year honors. The Champ Car series folded before the 2008 season. Stoddart's team entering the IndyCar Series under the HVM name.

Stoddart retains the right to use the Minardi name for a British-registered company.

Samuel Reshevsky

Samuel Reshevsky (Szmul Rzeszewski, near Łódź, 26 November 1911 – New York, 4 April 1992) was a Polish-American chess Grandmaster. 

Sammy was a famous chess prodigy, and later a leading American chess Grandmaster. He was a contender for the World Chess Championship from about 1935 to the mid-1960s. He came equal third in the World Chess Championship 1948 tournament, and equal second in the 1953 Candidates Tournament. He was also an eight-time winner of the U.S. Chess Championship.

He was the greatest American player in the long period between Pillsbury (d.1906) and Fischer. Sammy was an Orthodox Jew, and did not play on the Jewish Sabbath: his tournament games were re-arranged. He was a regular top board for the USA at Chess Olympiads. He played in eight Olympiads, helping the U.S. team to win the gold in 1937.

Sammy was tremendously strong in matches, and the Soviets made sure he never got the chance to play Botvinnik in a match. He played eleven of the first twelve world champions, and drew a match against Fischer at the age of 49. His one weakness as a player was his time trouble. He used up so much of his time in the early stages of a game that he was often short of time at the end. This probably cost him the Candidates tournament in 1953.

Reshevsky was not a full-time chess player. He was a qualified accountant.

London Bridge

London Bridge is a bridge over the River Thames. It is in central London, and connects the City of London with Southwark. It is between Cannon Street Railway Bridge and Tower Bridge. 

On the south side of the bridge are Southwark Cathedral and London Bridge station. On the north side are the Monument to the Great Fire of London and Monument tube station.

It was the only bridge over the Thames downstream from Kingston until Putney Bridge opened in 1729. The current bridge opened on 17 March 1973 and is the latest in a succession of bridges to occupy the spot and claim the name.

The bridge carries part of the A3 road, which is maintained by the Greater London Authority; the bridge itself is owned and maintained by a charity overseen by the City of London Corporation.

The name London Bridge is often mistakenly applied to Tower Bridge, which is the next bridge downstream.

A bridge has existed at or near the present site over the period from the Roman occupation of the area, nearly 2,000 years ago. The first bridge across the Thames in the London area, probably a military pontoon bridge, was built of wood by the Romans on the present site around 50 AD.

Around 55 AD, a piled bridge was constructed, and the local Britons built a small trading settlement next to it—the town of Londinium. The settlement and the bridge were destroyed in a revolt led by Queen Boudicca in 60 AD. The victory was short-lived, and soon afterwards the Romans defeated the rebels and set about building a new walled town. Some of the 2nd-century Roman wall has survived to this day. The new town and bridge were built around the position of the present bridge, providing access to the south-coast ports via Stane Street (the A3 route) and Watling Street (the A2).

The southern gatehouse, the Stone Gateway, became the scene of one of London's most notorious sights: a display of the severed heads of traitors, stuck on pikes and dipped in tar to preserve them. The head of William Wallace was the first to appear on the gate, in 1305, starting a tradition that was to continue for another 355 years. Other famous heads on pikes included those of Jack Cade in 1450, Thomas More in 1535, Bishop John Fisher in the same year, and Thomas Cromwell in 1540. In 1598 a German visitor to London counted over 30 heads on the bridge:
The practice was finally stopped in 1660. The mediaeval bridge itself was demolished in 1831, and replaced by the 19th century bridge. This bridge was sold in 1968, and replaced by the modern bridge.

Meqabyan

I, II, and III Meqabyan (Ge'ez: መቃብያን, sometimes spelled "Makabian") are three books in the Ethiopian Orthodox Old Testament Biblical canon. 

These books are very different in content from the books of Maccabees in Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Bibles, but they are sometimes called Ethiopic Maccabees or Ethiopian Maccabees. The "Maccabees" described in these books are not those of the Hasmonean dynasty, and the "Five Holy Maccabean Martyrs" here do not match "Woman with seven sons", who were also called "Maccabees" and are revered throughout Orthodoxy as the "Holy Maccabean Martyrs". 

These books were only written in Ethiopic for a long time, but have recently been translated into English.

Southwark is the main part of the inner London Borough of Southwark. It is on the Thames, south of London Bridge. It is often called just 'The Borough'. Southwark was once a separate town in Surrey, and was made part of London in 1889.

Southwark has several important buildings: Southwark Cathedral, London Bridge station and the Tate Modern art gallery. Two Roman roads met in Southwark: Watling Street and Stane Street. The area was marshy with islands in Roman times. They built the first London Bridge here.

The word 'Southwark' is pronounced "Suthuk".

London Bridge station is a major railway and London Underground station in the London Borough of Southwark. It is immediately south-east of London Bridge and 1.6 miles (2.6 km) east of Charing Cross. It is the oldest railway terminus in London, opened in June 1839. There is also a bus station. It is the fourth busiest rail terminal in London. In addition, it is where many commuters transfer between lines.

The mainline station is one of 18 railway stations managed by Network Rail and is a major transport terminus and interchange for south London. It serves over 54 million people a year. The tube station serves the Jubilee Line and the Bank branch of the Northern Line. All platforms are accessed through ticket barriers.

The station is in Travelcard Zone 1. London Bridge is one of two rail termini in London located south of the River Thames, the other being Waterloo. For this reason neither have a direct connection to the Circle Line.

Watling Street is the name of an ancient trackway in England. It was first used by the Ancient Britons between Canterbury and St Albans. 

Later the Romans made it one of the main Roman roads in Britain. The Romans paved the route from London to the port of Dover, and from London to St Albans. 'Street' comes from the old word for paving. Eventually, the road stretched right to the border of Wales (which the Romans did not occupy).

Its route is now covered by the A2 road from Dover to London, and the A5 road from London to Wroxeter (Roman "Viriconium", in modern Staffordshire). These are major roads in England, which still exist alonside the modern motorways.

Southwark Cathedral

Southwark Cathedral, in Southwark, London, lies on the south bank of the River Thames close to London Bridge. 

It is the mother church of the Anglican Diocese of Southwark. It has been a place of Christian worship for over 1,000 years, but a cathedral only since 1905. The present building is mainly Gothic, from 1220 to 1420. 

The main railway line from London Bridge station to Cannon Street station passes close to the cathedral, blocking the view from the south side. Borough Market and the Hall of the Worshipful Company of Glaziers and Painters of Glass by the river are close by.

The earliest reference to the site was in the Domesday Book survey of 1086. The 'Minster' of Southwark seems to be under the control of Bishop Odo of Bayeux (William the Conqueror's half-brother). Its early history is obscure. A Saxon minster (a teaching church) served a south Thames area. In 1106, Henry I's reign, the latter became an Augustinian Priory: Norman stonework can still be seen, and Thomas Becket preached here before departing to Canterbury, days before his murder in 1170.

The church is the oldest Gothic church building in London, built from 1220 to 1420. It is one of the smallest cathedrals, which is because it was not built as a cathedral, but as a Priory chapel.

The cathedral has three choirs, The main Cathedral Choir is supported financially by the St Olave's & St Saviour's Schools Foundation. They were two parochial schools set up in the 1560s, and still hold their annual services here as their 'foundation' church.

Charing Cross station

Charing Cross station, is a central London rail terminus in the City of Westminster . The rail station is one of 18 stations managed by Network Rail, and trains serving it are operated by Southeastern. It is the fifth busiest rail terminal in London.

Charing Cross station is also the name of the London Underground station at Charing Cross, with entrances in Trafalgar Square and The Strand.

The stations take their name from their position next to the central London road junction of Charing Cross. The front of the rail station faces The Strand. The other end is the northern end of Hungerford Bridge, which is crossed by all trains serving the station. Ticket barriers control access to all platforms, although the bridge entrance has no barriers. 

The original station building was built on the site of Hungerford Market and opened on 11 January 1864. The station has a single span wrought iron roof arching over the six platforms on its relatively cramped site. A year later the Charing Cross Hotel opened on 15 May 1865, and gave the station an ornate front in the French Renaissance style. At the same time, a replica of the Eleanor Cross was erected in the station forecourt, based on the original 13th century Whitehall Cross that had been demolished in 1647. Distances in London are officially measured from the original site of the cross in Whitehall, now the statue of Charles I, and not from this replica cross.

The station is served by the Northern and Bakerloo lines and provides an interchange with the National Rail network at the Charing Cross rail station. On the Northern Line it is between Embankment and Leicester Square stations on the Charing Cross branch, and on the Bakerloo Line it is between Embankment and Piccadilly Circus stations. It is in Travelcard Zone 1. 

The station was served by the Jubilee Line between 1979 and 1999; acting as the southern terminus of the line during that period. For most of the history of the Underground the name "Charing Cross" was associated not with this station but with the station now known as Embankment.

This is a terminal station approached across the River Thames by the Cannon Street Railway Bridge, with entrances from Cannon Street and Dowgate Hill. Its approach by rail is by a triangular connection to both London Bridge station and Charing Cross station. Cannon Street is one of seventeen UK railway stations managed by Network Rail.

The station was opened by the South Eastern Railway on 1 September 1866. The original station building had two Wren-style towers, square and high, which faced on to the River Thames. The towers supported a long iron train shed crowned by a high single arch, almost semicircular, of glass and iron. To this was joined in 1867 an Italianate style hotel and forecourt. These gave passenger facilities, as well as an impressive frontage onto the street.

Farringdon station

Farringdon station is a London Underground and National Rail station in Clerkenwell, just north of the City of London in the London Borough of Islington.

Farringdon will, from 2017, be one of the country's busiest stations (if not the busiest station) by number of trains passing through, being served by both Crossrail and the upgraded Thameslink route, as well as the existing Underground lines.

Farringdon station is being refurbished, to accommodate longer Thameslink trains, and to make other improvements to the station. The existing station building will be given a new roof canopy, and a new entrance and concourse facing Turnmill Street. Platforms will be widened, which will require the Cowcross Street bridge abutments to be moved. The bridge will be demolished and rebuilt once the abutments have been shifted. Cowcross Street will be pedestrianised. Lifts will be provided throughout.

The existing ticket hall and concourse will be remodelled. Interchange within the station will be improved by means of removing the existing interchange bridge and installing new stairs and lifts with access to all four platforms, thereby allowing passengers with impaired mobility to use the station.

Extensions towards the north are not planned mainly due to the steep gradient (1 in 27) of the Thameslink line immediately north of Farringdon. The platforms will therefore be extended southwards, severing the two-station branch to Moorgate.

The new station is commissioned from architects Aukett Fitzroy Robinson. By December 2009 there was considerable activity on the site with the construction of a new permanent entrance in Turnmill Street, a new footbridge has been installed and Cardinal Tower, on the site of Crossrail’s station, was nearing complete demolition by March 2009. The Moorgate branch was decommissioned during Christmas 2009.

A 'Farringdon' Crossrail station is being built between Farringdon and Barbican underground (tube) stations and it will have interchanges with both of them. Access at the Farringdon end will be via the new Thameslink ticket hall. Work will not be complete until 2017.

St Pancras station, also known since 2007 as St Pancras International, is a central London railway terminus celebrated for its Victorian architecture. 

The Grade I listed building stands on Euston Road between the British Library, King's Cross station and the Regent's Canal. It was opened in 1868 by the Midland Railway as its southern terminus. The company became the LMS: the London, Midland and Scottish railway. When the station opened, the arched train shed was the largest single-span roof in the world.

After escaping planned demolition in the 1960s, the complex was renovated and expanded during the 2000s at a cost of £800 million. A secure terminal area was constructed for Eurostar services to Continental Europe—via High Speed 1 and the Channel Tunnel—along with platforms for domestic connections to the north and south-east of England. The restored station houses fifteen platforms, a shopping centre and a bus station, in addition to London Underground services from King's Cross St. Pancras tube station. St Pancras is owned by London and Continental Railways along with the adjacent urban regeneration area known as King's Cross Central.

Newfoundland (dog)

The Newfoundland is a large breed of dog that originated in Newfoundland. They were first used by fishermen and sailors to carry goods and would jump overboard to save people from drowning. Newfoundlands are great swimmers because of their waterproof fur, their webbed feet and their strong muscles.

The Newfoundland is a very large dog breed, standing 26–28 inches (66–71 cm) and weighing 100–150 pounds (45–68 kg). The largest Newfoundland found was 72 inches (180 cm) long and weighed 160 pounds (73 kg). Their fur is usually long and a black, brown or gray color. Their facial hair is very short. The head is very large and the face is smooth with few wrinkles. The ears are long and wide, and reach below the jaw. The neck is strong and muscular. The Newfoundland's chest is large and wide with a large lung capacity. Because Newfoundlands are excellent swimmers, their thighs are very strong and muscular and their feet are tight. Their tail is very strong and is important for them to swim well.

Newfoundlands can suffer from a lot of health problems. They are the fifth most likely breed to have hip dysplasia. Newfoundlands can have problems with cystinuria in a similar way to humans. Newfoundlands can inherit subvalvular aortic stenosis, a trait which hurts the heart.

Newfoundlands are known to be very gentle and loyal dogs. Because of their protective nature for children, Newfoundlands have been used as watchdogs. Because of its thick fur, owners need to brush a Newfoundland's fur once a week.

Hereford Cathedral

Hereford Cathedral is a church in the town of Hereford. The present building was started in 1079. Before that there were two other cathedrals. It is the seat of the Bishop of Hereford.

The most famous treasure in Hereford Cathedral is the "Mappa Mundi", a mediæval map of the world dating from the 13th century. The cathedral is a Grade I listed building.

The first Hereford Cathedral was a stone building from the 7th century. After about 200 years it was changed, but then it was burnt down in 1056 by Welsh and Irish soldiers. The rebuilding started in 1079 and it was finished around 1140.

Many changes have been made since that time. The cathedral originally had Norman architecture, but not much of that has survived. By the end of the 13th century most of it had been changed. The changes continued in the 14th century when the central tower was rebuilt. Many other parts were added, the last big change was the adding of the main north entrance finished in 1535. This was mostly the cathedral we see today.

The Norman columns and arches of the nave have some decorations. They are original, done in the early 12th century. In the south aisle of the nave there are two tombs dating from the 14th century tombs. They are for members of the clergy but we do not know who they are. There is a tomb for Sir Richard Pembridge who was a Knight of the Garter.

There is a modern rood screen, a big lantern, and a reredos (a screen or decoration behind the altar). The Lady Chapel has lancet windows (tall, narrow windows) and lots of ornaments. There is a bit of ancient ironwork in the tomb of Bishop Booth who had the porch built There is also a large Norman font. The north transept was built in the Decorated Gothic. It has the shrine of St. Thomas of Hereford. The north window has some beautiful 19th century stained glass.

The tomb of the shrine of Bishop Cantilupe is built of Purbeck marble. The south transept may be the oldest part of the cathedral. The choir (the part of the cathedral where the choir sit), has many beautiful features. There is a reredos which represents Jesus on the cross. Two pointed arches show Christ with angels and the four evangelists. There is also a very strange, old Episcopal chair.

The organ was built in 1892 by Henry Willis. It is one of the best organs he made. Organists of the past include John Bull and Samuel Sebastian Wesley. Today the organist is Geraint Bowen. There has been a choir at Hereford Cathedral from at least as far back as the 13th century. Hereford Cathedral is one of the three cathedrals which house the Three Choirs Festival. In the tower there are 10 bells. They are often called the "Grand Old Lady".

The famous Hereford "Mappa Mundi" (Map of the World) dates from the 13th century. It is the largest (except for one) map from that period drawn on a single sheet of vellum. It was ignored for many years, then in 1855 it was cleaned and repaired at the British Museum. It shows the world as round, with the ocean all around it. It was nearly sold in the 1980s, but money was found to build a library where it could be hanged. This is where it is now.

Another famous document is one of only four copies of the Magna Carta to survive. It is kept very carefully, and sometimes shown to the public in the library next to the Mappa Mundi.

An unfinished building is a building that was being built, but was either abandoned or is on hold. There are many different reasons why buildings have not been completed. The National Monument in Scotland was planned to be a War Memorial for soldiers killed in the Napoleonic Wars. Building started in 1826, but the money ran out in 1829. The Sagrada Família, a church in Barcelona, Spain, was started in 1882 and is still not finished. It is not finished because when the architect, Antoni Gaudi, died in 1926, and he did not leave many plans for the building. What was left was destroyed during the Spanish Civil War.

Hungerford Bridge

Hungerford Bridge is a railway bridge which crosses the River Thames in London from Charing Cross station across to the south, near Waterloo station.

The bridge, often called Charing Cross Bridge, lies between Waterloo Bridge and Westminster Bridge. It is a steel bridge with two more recent pedestrian bridges on either side. These were named the Golden Jubilee Bridges, but are really just footpaths alongside the railway bridge. Each footpath has steps and lift access.

The north end of the bridge is Charing Cross station. It is near Embankment Pier and the Victoria Embankment. The south end is near Waterloo station, County Hall, the Royal Festival Hall, and the London Eye.

The first version of the bridge was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and opened in 1845. The bridge and the walkways have been reworked and expanded at various times.

Albert Bridge

Albert Bridge is a road bridge over the River Thames in West London. It connects Chelsea on the north bank to Battersea on the south bank. Designed and built in 1873 as a cable-stayed bridge, it proved to be structurally unsound. Between 1884 and 1887 Sir Joseph Bazalgette added some elements of a suspension bridge. More work was done in 1973. As a result, the bridge today is a hybrid of three different design styles.

Built as a toll bridge, it was unsuccessful. Six years after its opening it was taken into public ownership, and the tolls were lifted. The tollbooths remained in place, and are the only surviving examples of bridge tollbooths in London. Its nickname is 'The Trembling Lady' because of its tendency to vibrate when large numbers of people walked over it. Signs at the entrances warn troops from the nearby Chelsea Barracks to break step while crossing the bridge.

With a roadway only wide, and with serious structural weaknesses, the bridge was ill-equipped to cope with motor traffic. Despite this, Albert Bridge has remained open to vehicles, apart from brief spells for repairs. It is one of only two Thames road bridges in central London which have never been replaced. 

The strengthening work did not prevent further decay of the bridge's structure. Strict traffic control limits its use and prolongs its life. It is the least busy Thames road bridge in London except for Southwark Bridge. The bridge's condition continues to get worse as the result of traffic. Also, severe rotting of the timber deck is caused by the urine of dogs using it as a route to nearby Battersea Park.

In 1992 Albert Bridge was rewired and painted in an unusual colour scheme designed to make it easy to see, and avoid being hit by shipping. At night it is lit by 4,000 bulbs, making it one of West London's most striking landmarks.

Action figure

Moveable man of action or the action figure is a character figurine.They may be made from plastic or other materials.They are often based on characters from a movie, comic book, video game, or television program. One of the most famous action figures is G.I. Joe.

Before the 1960s, toys had little or no movement. The company Hasbro in 1964 came up with a new toy they called an action figure. This toy was G.I. Joe created by Stan Weston. G.I. Joe had a military look with changeable clothing and accessories ready for action. Action figures were made to give boys a toy since Barbie in 1959 was so popular with girls. Starting in the 1970s comic book superheros were made into action figures. Marvel Comics and DC Comics began making their action figures to appeal to kids favorite superheroes.

Hasbro spent many years getting information and drawings of military weapons and vehicles for the use of their military action figures the G.I.Joes.The first African American G.I.Joe was made in the second year of the action figures. In 1967 the first female G.I.Joe was made, she was a nurse.G.I. Joe in 1985 got a cartoon TV show and in 2009 a movie was made.
Over many years Hasbro made "men of action" figures including people like: George Washington, Robert E. Lee, John F. Kennedy,Bob Hope, etc.

In the 80′s, the need for action figures got bigger with all the cartoons that started on TV. Shows like Masters of the Universe, G.I. Joe and Thundercats which got the attention of young boys and gave a need for the action figures of their favorite shows. Hasbro got the idea for the Transformers we know today from a cartoon in Japan and brought it to the United States in 1984, cartoon episodes and then action figures soon came along.

By the 1990's action figures became toys for adults as well but for the use of collecting and value. These action figures came from movies, TV,and famous people like rock stars.

From the 2000s on, and up to these days, there was a transition made into movies, where popular movies would have action figures of their own characters. And not only movies, but also musicians, athletes and other figures of importance in the media.

Today, the adult collector market for action figures is expanding with companies like McFarlane Toys, Palisades, and NECA.Companies have given numerous movie characters, musicians, and athletes their very first highly detailed figures. These are commonly intended as display pieces rather than toys; however, child-oriented lines such as the Masters of the Universe revival and Justice League Unlimited still get adult collector followings as well. Comic book are also able to get figures of their characters produced, regardless of whether or not they appeared in movies or animated cartoons. Examples of companies that produce comic figures and merchandise almost exclusively include Toy Biz and DC Direct.

Adult-action figure lines are often exclusive to specific chain stores rather than mass retail. Popular lines often have figures available exclusively through mail-in offers and comic conventions like comic con, which raises their value significantly. Ploys such as packaging "errors" and "short-packed" figures have also been used by toy companies to increase collector interest.
Action figures are usually made of plastic. These toys are able to move and hold different poses. Making an action figure starts with the idea and drawing. Next, wire and clay models are made. When a figure is approved, it gets molded from a plastic. Paint and fabric complete the toy.



Action figures were made to give boys a toy like Barbie. Unlike Barbie, G.I. Joe was meant to be manly and strong which is why a military toy was made.

Like Barbie, The action figure's body shows an almost unrealistic body image for boys. Some action figures like the WWF wrestler's body on the action figure have unrealistic muscles. These body images of strong wrestlers, superhero, and G.I. Joe tell boys that they too can grow up to be big and strong, which may not always be the case.

Today there are action figures for girls too. Movie character action figures like Edward Cullen from the movie Twilight are collected by girls.

<doc id="261237" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=261237" title="Ring of Steel (London)">
Ring of Steel (London)

Ring of steel is the name people use for the security cordon around the City of London. Its purpose is to prevent terrorism. It was designed during the IRA 'troubles'. The city of Belfast was the first to get a "ring of steel".

Roads entering the City are narrowed and have small chicanes to force drivers to slow down and be recorded by CCTV cameras. These roads have a concrete median with a sentry box where police can stand guard and monitor traffic. Tucked away out of sight may be police armed with submachine guns. City planners call these precautions 'fortress urbanism'.

Some roads have been closed to traffic entirely. Despite the term 'ring of steel', the roadblocks and chicanes are actually created with concrete blocks, sometimes plastic coated, that are wedged together.

The measures were introduced following a massive IRA bombing campaign in the City in the early 1990s such as the 1992 Baltic Exchange bombing and the 1993 Bishopsgate bombing. At this time the sentry posts were guarded by armed police almost continuously. Initially the ring of steel consisted of plastic cones and on duty policemen which the locals described as the 'ring of plastic'. It showed the public that the City authorities were taking seriously the threats by the IRA. This was replaced by more permanent structures consisting of concrete barriers, checkpoints and thousands of video cameras. After the IRA ceasefire the police guard was reduced. 

Following the September 11 attacks, and the increased terrorist threats to the United Kingdom, security has been stepped up again. In December 2003, the Ring of Steel was widened to include more businesses in the City. Police thought a terrorist attack on the City was "inevitable".

Traffic entering London is also monitored and recorded at many places by an automatic number-plate recognition system (ANPR). It is watched all the time by police. The data is stored for five years for analysis and evidence.

<doc id="261264" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=261264" title="Millennium Bridge">
Millennium Bridge

The Millennium Bridge is a footbridge across the River Thames in London. It is a steel suspension bridge which links Bankside with the City. Its position is between Southwark Bridge (downstream) and Blackfriars Railway Bridge (upstream). The bridge opened on 10 June 2000. It is the newest bridge across the Thames. 

Londoners nicknamed the bridge the Wobbly Bridge after people on a charity walk felt an uncomfortable swaying motion. The bridge was closed later that day. After two days of limited access the bridge was closed for almost two years. Expensive and complicated changes were made to eliminate the wobble. It was reopened in 2002.

The southern end of the bridge is near Globe Theatre, the Bankside Gallery and Tate Modern, the north end next to the City of London School below St Paul's Cathedral. The bridge alignment is such that a clear view of St Paul's south facade is presented from across the river, framed by the bridge supports.

The design of the bridge was the subject of a competition organized in 1996 by Southwark council. The winning entry was by Arup, Foster and Partners and Sir Anthony Caro. The eight suspension cables are tensioned to pull with a force of 2,000 tons against the piers set into each bank — enough to support a working load of up to 5,000 people on the bridge at one time.

The closure of the bridge only three days after opening attracted consideerable public criticism, as another high-profile British millennium project suffered an embarrassing setback, akin to how many saw the Millennium Dome. There was some astonishment that engineers had not foreseen the problem, as computer modelling is such a standard technique today. However, modifications to the bridge did eliminate the wobble, which has not recurred since the bridge reopened in February 2002.

The bridge's movements were caused by a 'positive feedback' phenomenon. The natural sway motion of people walking caused small sideways oscillations in the bridge. In turn, this caused people on the bridge to sway in step, increasing the amplitude of the bridge oscillations and reinforced the effect.

The bridge opened on an exceptionally fine day, and it was included on the route of a major charity walk. On the day of opening the bridge was crossed by 90,000 people, with up to 2,000 on the bridge at any one time.

The lateral vibration problems of the Millennium Bridge are very unusual, but not entirely unique. Other bridges which have seen similar problems are:

After extensive analysis by the engineers, the problem was fixed by fitting 37 dampers (energy dissipating) to control horizontal movement and 52 (inertial) dampers to control vertical movement. This took from May 2001 to January 2002 and cost £5m. After a period of testing, the bridge was successfully re-opened on 22 February 2002. The bridge has not been subject to significant vibration since. In spite of the successful fix of the problem, the affectionate 'wobbly bridge' epithet remains in common usage amongst Londoners.

List of Formula One constructors

The following is a list of Formula One constructors. These are constructors which have competed or plan to compete in the FIA World Championship.

In Formula One racing the terms "constructor" and "entrant" do not mean the same thing. A "constructor" builds a car or engine. An "entrant" is the person or corporate entity that enters a race. They register a car and driver with the FIA. They are responsible for making the car ready to race, and keeping the car in good condition during the race weekend. Because of the role and activity of the entrant, the term "team" is often used when talking about an entrant.

Under the FIA rules, "the constructor of an engine or chassis is the person (including any corporate or unincorporated body) which owns the intellectual rights to such engine or chassis." Basically, who ever builds an engine or a chassis in the constructor. The title of Formula One World Champion Constructor is given to the car "make" that scores the most points during the season. The "make" of a car includes both the chassis and engine. 

If a car's chassis and engine are made by the same entity, then the constructor is the car make. For example Ferrari makes both the chassis and the engine. So the make is Ferrari. If the chassis and engine are made by different entities, the car's make is both constructor names put together. For example McLaren builds a chassis that uses a Mercedes engine. So the make is McLaren-Mercedes. The name of the chassis constructor is always placed before the engine constructor. 

Because both engine and chassis are included in the make name, chassis run with different engines are counted as two separate makes. For example, Lotus-Ford is a make different from Lotus-BRM. Each make would be scored separately. The World Constructors' Championship title is awarded to the constructor of the "chassis" of the make that scores the most points. This list only shows chassis constructors for that reason. For more information on engines, see Formula One engines.

Since the early 1980s, the FIA requires that Formula One entrants own the intellectual rights to the chassis that they enter. Basically, that means that temas must build their own chassis. Since this time, the terms "entrant", "constructor", and "team' now mean the same thing. Before this time, constructors were free to sell their chassis to other teams. Brabham and Lotus chassis were used by many other teams during the 1960s and 1970s. Several teams than compeated with the front-runners never built their own chassis. Rob Walker Racing Team was the most successful example. They earned the first victories in Formula One for both Cooper and Lotus. 

In those days, the concept of a "works" or "factory" team was the official team of the company producing the cars. Customer teams were entrants that purchased their cars off the shelf. In modern Formula One, the team must build their own car. The term customer only applies to engines now.

There have been some cases since the 1980's where one company built cars for another team. Lola designed and built cars for Larrousse and Scuderia Italia in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Genesis creation narrative

The Genesis creation myth, found in the first two chapters of the Book of Genesis in the Bible, describes a supernatural beginning of the earth and life, ending with the creation of humans in the image of God. The creation myth is part of the Bible of Judaism and Christianity.

Chapter 1 tells of God's creation of the world, ending with the consecration of the seventh day as the Sabbath. Man and woman are created to be God's rulers over the new creation. Chapter 2 tells of God's planting a garden in which he places the first man, and from whose rib he creates the first woman. The chapter ends by saying marriage is holy.

Nave

The nave is where the congregation sits in a church. It usually has long benches, called 'pews', or separate chairs.

Naves are found in humble Saxon churches, and in grand Romanesque and Gothic Christian Abbeys, Cathedrals, and Basilicas. 

The nave is the central approach to the high altar, the main body of the church. 'Nave' (Medieval Latin "navis", "ship") was probably suggested by the keel shape of its vaulting. The nave of a church goes from the entry to the chancel. It is flanked by aisles separated from the nave by an arcade. If the aisles are high and of a width comparable to the central nave, the structure is sometimes said to have three naves.

Hexham Abbey

Hexham Abbey is an Anglican church in the town of Hexham, Northumberland, dedicated to St Andrew. Since the Dissolution of the monasteries in 1537, the Abbey has been the parish church of Hexham.

The Abbey, which was a cathedral in Saxon times, is part of the Diocese of Newcastle. The diocese is based in Newcastle upon Tyne, and includes the historic county of Northumberland in northeast England. 

There has been a church on this site for over 1300 years since Etheldreda, Queen of Northumbria, made a grant of lands c.674. The Benedictine abbey was built almost entirely of stones from nearby Roman ruins. The Saxon crypt still remains; as does a "frith" stool, a 7th/8th century 'cathedra' or throne.

In the year 875 Halfdene the Dane ravaged the whole of Tyneside and Hexham Church was plundered and burnt to the ground.

About 1050 one Eilaf was put in charge of Hexham, although as treasurer of Durham, he probably never came there. Eilaf was instructed to rebuild Hexham Church which then lay in utter ruin. His son Eilaf II completed the work probably building in the Norman style.

In Norman times, the old abbey was replaced by an Augustinian priory. The present church is from that period (c.1170–1250), in the Early English (Gothic) style of architecture. The choir, north and south transepts and the cloisters date from this period.

The east end was rebuilt in 1860, and the rest of the Abbey was largely rebuilt around 1900. This mammoth project involved re-building the nave, whose walls include some of the earlier church. The nave was re-consecrated in 1908. In 1996 an additional chapel was created at the east end of the north choir aisle. Named "St Wilfrid's Chapel", it offers a place for prayer or quiet reflection.

Welcome to Friendly.

Friendly is a collection of JavaScripts written by Ioeth that provide an interface similar to (by using 's JavaScript library) for Wikipedia's more friendly, collaboration-oriented tasks.

Currently, the implemented features are , , , , and a handy UTC clock that will the current page when clicked. This functionality is provided via tabs labeled "tb", "wel" and "shared ip" when on a user talk page and "tag" when in article space. A "welcome" link is also placed on pages next to users that have talk pages.

More features are always in the pipeline and Friendly is under ongoing development, so be sure to report any bugs or request new features on .


Friendly adds additional features to various parts of Wikipedia. Each tab's ID is given to assist with further customization via additional user CSS or JavaScript.

The friendlyclock feature inserts an updating UTC clock in the top right-hand corner of the screen so that the UTC time is always visible and handy. This feature also allows the ability to easily the current page by simply clicking on the clock. If you have other scripts or gadgets installed that add a UTC clock to the screen, you may want to disable them, or disable this feature of Friendly. The feature can be entirely disabled by setting the codice_1 configuration parameter to codice_2.

Element ID: codice_3

A welcome link will appear next to a user in a diff view if the user's talk page is empty. This allows you to quickly welcome the user with the template specified in the codice_4 parameter (by default) or easily open the user's talk page with Friendly's welcome dialogue already visible (if the codice_5 parameter is set to codice_6). This feature is available when viewing any diff across all namespaces.

The friendlytabs feature can be used to shorten all of the common, long tab names that Wikipedia uses. For example, "edit this page" is changed to "edit" and "discussion" to "talk", by default. This gives Friendly users more room for a variety of extra function tabs by shortening the amount of space that common tabs take up. This feature can be configured or disabled; see the configuration section for details.

The tb tab will allow you to easily leave templates on other users' talk pages. It supports all of the talkback template's options that you would have available as if you were leaving the template by hand.

Tab element ID: codice_7

The wel tab will welcome the user with selected template.

If an article is specified in the input field, and the template supports an article link, Friendly will automatically link the template to the article you specified. All templates that support this are marked with an asterisk ("*"). In the case of normal welcome templates, the article would be one that the user contributed positively to. In the case of problem user welcome templates, the article would be one that the user vandalized or did not contribute positively to. This input field is automatically populated if the codice_8 URL parameter is found, which is populated by Twinkle after doing a rollback.

Friendly is capable of supporting a custom list of templates that displays below the standard set of Welcome templates. If you have installed Friendly, you can add a list of templates that you would like to be added to the Welcome dialogue by properly defining the codice_9 parameter in Friendly's configuration. Any templates added to this list, when selected, will simply be placed on the user's talk page with no heading, no arguments, and will be followed by your signature.

Tab element ID: codice_10

The shared ip tab will tag the IP as a .

Most of the require that the name of the organization that owns or operates the IP address be input. If one of these templates is selected, Friendly will require that you fill in the "Organization name" input field, which does support .

Tab element ID: codice_11

The tag tab will tag the article with the template(s) of your choice.

All templates that are checked will be added to the article in their proper respective locations. Templates that support it will automatically be added with the codice_12 parameter populated to the current month and year. If the "Group into <nowiki></nowiki> if possible" checkbox is ticked, Friendly will group supported templates into an template, if there are four or more. All other selected templates are then added to the article normally. If there are three or fewer selected templates that are supported by the template, the setting is ignored, and all templates are added to the article normally.

Three templates in the list, , , and , allow you to select from a list of subcategories of the respective templates. The standard template is the default, and selecting a subcategory is not required, but it does place a more specific version of the template on the article. If a subcategory is selected and templates are being grouped into , the subcategory is ignored as only supports the standard template. The subcategories are ignored in the same way when grouping.

If the redirect URL parameter is set to "no" and there is no rcid URL parameter, the tag tab will assume that you are viewing a redirect page. Instead of presenting you with a normal set of article tags, the tab will present you with a set of redirect categorization tags, from .

Tab element ID: codice_13

To install all Friendly modules, including all future updates and additions:


You may wish to re-configure Friendly's default settings after installation. See below for instructions.

If you just want to use one or more of the individual modules, here they are listed with their dependencies. The line codice_14 is only needed once in your appropriate .js file, and Twinkle already includes it (so you don't need it if you're a Twinkle user already). It is recommended that you do not import any script more than once, as it would just be a duplicate, but the codice_15 function has a check to make sure that a script is not imported more than once.

Optionally, to configure Friendly, copy the text below and paste it in or file. It does not matter if you put the config before or after the includes . Each line contains a specific setting which is described below. You can remove any settings that you do not want to change from the default, but do not remove the first line. When changing settings, make sure not to remove the semicolon from the end of each line.

This is the default configuration:
Alternatively, you can copy only the settings you wish to change in the following format:

Defines whether a static or dynamic clock should be displayed. The dynamic clock will update the time continuously, while the static clock will always display the time that you loaded the page. Valid parameter values are codice_16 and codice_17.

Argument is a String, default to codice_16.

Argument is a boolean, default to codice_19.

Defines if the checkbox for template grouping should be checked by default.

It is recommended that you not change this option.

Argument is a boolean, default to codice_19.

Defines the document ids for the tabs that Friendly's tab feature should rename. It is an array of hashes, with each hash containing an id that must be a string and a name that must be a string. If a matching id is found on the page you are currently browsing, Friendly changes the link name to what is defined in the name. If renaming the article tab (id: 'ca-nstab-main') you can also specify a boolean parameter called mainPageOnly in the hash. If set to true, the particular name for the id in this hash will only be used on Wikipedia's main page.

Argument is an array of hashes, default to:
To remove all tab renaming, replace this line with codice_21

Defines whether a heading is added to a welcome template that does not already contain one.

Defines whether Friendly will reference the specific template you used in the edit summary. This is useful if you do not want welcomed users to see that you welcomed them with , for instance.

Argument is a boolean, default to codice_19.

Defines which quick welcome mode Friendly will operate in when welcoming a new user directly from a historical diff page. Automatic mode will add the template defined in the codice_4 variable to the user's talk page with no user intervention. Semi-automatic mode will load the user's talk page and then prompt you with the welcome template list as if you clicked the "welcome" tab.

The value of this argument must either be codice_33 or codice_6.

Argument is a string, default to codice_6.

Defines which welcome template Friendly will use when welcoming a new user directly from a historical diff page.

The value of this argument must exactly match one of the templates available from the "welcome" tab on a user talk page. Do not include the curly braces, only the template name, and make sure the capitalization matches.

Argument is a string, default to codice_36.

Defines what summary Ad to be added.

Argument is a string, default to codice_37.

Argument is a boolean, default to codice_19.

Defines what heading is to be added to welcome templates if codice_38 is true and the welcome template has no heading.

Argument is a string, default to codice_44.

Friendly's tag and welcome functionality supports custom maintenance and welcome templates which are provided to the script by adding the codice_45 and codice_9 parameters to FriendlyConfig. This functionality is somewhat complex to set up, so it is not recommended for users that are inexperienced with JavaScript. If you require assistance, please post a message on and someone will most likely come along to help you out.

To add custom template functionality to your Friendly tag screen, insert the following code below your other Friendly configuration:

Simply replace "CustomTag" with the name of the template that you would like to add to the script and either remove or replace the description on the "label" line. This section of your configuration can be extended to include as many custom maintenance templates as you would like. Make sure to use a comma to separate each element in the array while not including one after the last element.

To add custom template functionality to your Friendly welcome screen, insert the following code below your other Friendly configuration:

Simply replace "CustomWelcome" with the name of the template that you would like to add to the script and either remove or replace the description on the "label" line. This section of your configuration can be extended to include as many custom welcome templates as you would like. Make sure to use a comma to separate each element in the array while not including one after the last element.

<doc id="261404" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=261404" title="Amor Prohibido (song)">
Amor Prohibido (song)

"Amor Prohibido" () is a song by American singer Selena. The song was written by Selena, her brother A.B. Quintanilla III, and Pete Astudillo. It became the lead single from the album of the same name (1994). "Amor Prohibido" is about the relationship between a man and a woman. Their love is put to the test by problems over money, social differences and disapproval from their parents. Some music reviewers believe the song is similar to the Romeo and Juliet story because of its theme of forbidden love.

"Amor Prohibido" became the most successful single, along with "No Me Queda Mas", of 1994 and 1995. It later became one of Selena's signature songs. The song won awards at the Tejano Music Awards and at the Premio Lo Nuestros in 1994 and for the next three years. "Amor Prohibido" reached number one on the US Hot Latin Songs and number five on the Latin Regional Mexican Airplay charts on "Billboard".

The song helped Selena attract larger and younger audiences to her concerts because of its different sounds. Selena chose to step out of the Tejano genre and explore Latin dance-pop with "Amor Prohibido". Non-Mexicans also began enjoying Tejano music because of the new sounds in Selena's music. The music video was filmed in Joshua Tree, California. It was released on all the Spanish-language television channels in the United States and Mexico on Valentine's Day. It was later certified gold by AMPROFON, while the song sold 500,000 copies in the United States. Various recording artists worldwide, including non-Hispanics, have since made cover versions of "Amor Prohibido". 

"Amor Prohibido" was written by Selena's brother, A.B. Quintanilla III. A former Selena y Los Dinos backup singer, Pete Astudillo, also helped. It was recorded at Q-Productions, a small studio label founded by Selena's father, Abraham Quintanilla Jr. It was mixed by Brian "Red" Moore, a family friend. "Amor Prohibido" was produced and engineered by Jorge Alberto Pino and Argentine composer and arranger Bebu Silvetti. "Amor Prohibido" was prepared by Joe Ojeda, and Chris Pérez, Selena's husband. 

The song was written during Selena's "Live! Tour" in 1993. It began when Selena began to hum a melody in the tour bus. Her brother and Astudillo began writing down her melody lines. They wanted to write the entire melody into a song. "Amor Prohibido" was based on Selena's grandparents, Mexican immigrants, who were not allowed to be together. Their parents, Selena's great-grandparents, had forbidden them to love each other because they were from different social classes. When interviewed about the song, Selena said "Amor Prohibido" meant a lot to her and her family, and that it is one of her favorite songs. "Amor Prohibido" became the most successful single, along with "No Me Queda Mas", of 1994 and 1995.

The song was officially finished after she had won a Grammy Award for "Best Mexican/American Album" for "Selena Live!" (1993). "Amor Prohibido" had a lot of airplay after it was released as a promotional single on April 13, 1994. It became one of Selena's signature songs, and a fan favorite.

Selena promoted "Amor Prohibido" during her Amor Prohibido Tour. Fans in Denver, Colorado were the first crowd to watch Selena perform "Amor Prohibido" at the start of the tour on January 28, 1994.

"Amor Prohibido" is a Spanish-language Tejano pop song mixed with modern Latin pop and South American rhythms. It is set in common time with a moderate beat tempo of 90 beats per minute. The song is performed in E major with the guitar, tambourine and harp as the main instruments.

"Amor Prohibido" describes a relationship between a man and a woman. The song's message tells listeners to stick with their partner, no matter what may happen, even if their parents forbid them to love each other. Music critics have compared it to the story of Romeo and Juliet because it is also about forbidden love.

"Amor Prohibido" helped Selena attract bigger crowds to her concerts. Selena also began to attract younger audiences to her music. Selena had stepped out of Tejano music and begun to explore other Latin genres, such as Latin dance-pop with "Amor Prohibido". This new type of sound was given positive feedback by music critics. This helped other non-Mexicans to enjoy Tejano music. The song had South American rhythms and sounds. With this new type of sound, more Hispanics became fans of Selena. Most of Selena's songs were written by her brother Quintanilla III. Quintanilla III wrote most of her songs that broke free from "Tejano" and "Tex-Mex" (Texas-Mexico) music. This led Selena to be named "The Queen of Tejano music", because she was the first and only Tejano artist to ever achieve fame in different styles of music. Ramiro Burr, of Amazon, said "The hits were obvious—the eloquent "Amor Prohibido," on love conducted in secret". During the About.com's countdown for "The top 12 Spanish-language songs that have been played on English-language radio", the singles, "Dreaming of You", "Como La Flor" and "Amor Prohibido" were among the named hits. The editor said that "Amor Prohibido" and the title track were popular in Latin America.

Selena was named the "Top Latin Artist of the '90s" and "Best selling Latin artist of the decade" by "Billboard". This was because she had fourteen top-ten singles in the "Top Latin Songs" chart, including seven number one hits. To celebrate and honor Selena on the fifteenth anniversary of her death, Music Choice On Demand selected several Selena music videos, including "Amor Prohibido", as a tribute which was watched in over 42 million homes nationwide. The "Daily Vault" called "Amor Prohibido" a "seamless track", which made them wonder about Selena's father, Abraham Quintanilla Jr, and called him an "over-influential" on Selena.

The music video was filmed in Joshua Tree, California by Tango Productions. It was directed by Cecilia Miniucchi, who directed most of Selena's music videos. Philip Holahan filmed the video, and Clayton Halsey edited the video after it was filmed. Filming began on February 6, 1994. The music video was released on all major Spanish-language television channels in America on Valentine's Day.
The music video begins with Selena running towards an open door in the desert. This symbolizes a new relationship. She then walks outwards from a wall, which shows videos of a couple who are in love. Selena begins singing the song while walking in the desert, with the wind blowing her hair around. She sings of how much she really wants to hear her boyfriend speak. The video then changes scenes to Selena at the open door dancing and singing along with the song. After Selena spins around once, she is seen looking out from a window, seeing herself and her boyfriend dancing. She tells him that their love should not be about money and that they should not worry about what their parents had told them. More love scenes are shown with Selena and her boyfriend laughing and enjoying each other's company. After telling him that their love should be based on how much they love each other, Selena looks at her reflection in a small puddle. While looking out from the window, Selena tells her boyfriend that she is poor and that her love is all she can give to him. The video ends with Selena and her boyfriend running away from the world and going into a new one together.

Chapter house

A Chapter house or chapterhouse is a special building or room attached to a cathedral or large church. It is where the cathedral chapter meetings are held. Chapter houses were also built in mediaeval monasteries.

In a cathedral, the chapter is always chaired by the Dean, whose job it is to run (manage) the cathedral. Members of the chapter will include Canons, who may include top lay officials as well as priests. It is a management group for the cathedral.

The side of the cloister with the chapter house was usually the first to be constructed; it would have been started shortly after the church’s frame was put up.

When part of a monastery, the chapter house is usually on the eastern wing of the cloister. It is a large space, to hold all the monks of the monastery. It is built in the same style as the churches of that day. In some Romanesque or Gothic monasteries, the entrance to the chapter house is a miniature version of the entrance to a cathedral.

The community of monks would meet in the chapter house with the Abbot to 'hold chapter'. This meant to read aloud from the rule book and Bible, and to discuss matters concerning the monastery and its monks. The meetings generally took place in the morning, after mass; the monks would sit along the length of the walls in strict age-order. At the end of the meeting the monks would publicly confess their sins or denounce others' (anonymously).

Canon (church)

A Canon in a church is an official. He may or may not be a priest. The Chapter of a cathedral is an official group made up of the Dean and Chapter of canons, who meet in a chapterhouse. They run the cathedral, especially the business affairs of the cathedral. They are the body which has legal responsibility for the cathedral, and for electing the (arch)bishop.

Originally, a canon was a cleric who lived in the precinct of the cathedral. The word meant a priest who was under (ruled by) a bishop.

In the Anglican church, some canons are laypersons (not ordained). The title is also given to some senior or retired priests as an honorary title.

In combat sports like fencing, boxing, karate, etc., the cover is a defensive movement permitting to protect oneself against strikes by placing a weapon or a body part like the fist, forearm, elbow, arm or shoulder before the aim aimed by this attack. 

This form of defence, so-called "passive", is different from the block or parry that are considered "active". The cover has nearly the same meaning as "protection" especially in boxing when a fighter raises his arm in order to protect his face or head against a possible attack.

<doc id="261479" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=261479" title="Manipuri dance">
Manipuri dance

Manipuri dance covers a number of different dances from Manipur, a state in the northeast corner of India. The main dance types are the Laiharoaba, the Samkirtana, and the Rasalila. The classical style of dances is described as being the most graceful of all the classical Indian dances. Rabindranath Tagore used the style for his female characters in his famous dance dramas. 

Manipur shares a border with Burma. The people of Manipur are part of the Mongoloid group, with a very rich and artistic culture.

The oldest form of dance is found in the Laiharaoba festival. The word "Lai" means God, and the word "Haraoba" means merrymaking. Laiharaoba means merrymaking of the gods. The festival generally lasts for a month and is held every year in the months of May and June. The Maibi community holds the Laiharaoba festival. Maibis are female priests, although there a some male priests too. There are specific rituals that the maibis follow during the festival. They dance and worship the forest gods, called the "Umang Lai". There are also household gods, for example the "Sanamahi" or "Panthoibi". All these gods are worshipped in the Laiharaoba festival. The Maibis dance and show the formation of earth and life. They use 364 hand gestures to show this. During the festival the people of Manipur sing, dance, act, play instruments and play sports. The rituals are pre-determined and all the village people participate.

The instrument used in Laiharaoba is called the "Pena". It is a very special instrument of Manipur. It is played by the "Penakhongba", and the tune is believed to put the Lai to sleep or used to wake him up. Other tunes are also played for the dances. The story of Khamba and Thoibi are played here. The other stories have characters such as the Nongpokningthou and Panthoibi. These are basically love stories. The characters are often identified with the Hindu Gods Shiva and Parvati. Though mostly based on nature worship, according to the Manipuri scholars, this festival has elements of Tantric Cults. 

The very popular martial art of Manipur, "Thangpak", is also a part of this festival, with performances of sword and spear play. Many movements of "Thangpak" are also part of the dances of Manipur. For example, the popular "Khujengleibi" movement in dance is found in the sword technique. 

In the 18th century, Manipur came under the influence of Chaitanite Vaishnavism which was a branch of Hinduism. Vaishnavism made its entry in Manipur during the reign of King Charairongba. During the rule of Raja Bhagyachandra, Chaitanite Vaishnavism became a permanent part of Manipur's culture. The Raja joined this religion and his subjects followed him. Many parts of daily life changed with Vaishnavism; the rituals of Vaishnavism were followed very closely by the community. The gods of the religion, Krishna and Radha were worshipped and temples were built all over Manipur. The people started worshipping the gods with dance. There were two kinds of dance that developed with the influence of this religion: the "Samkirtana" and the "Rasalila".

"Samkirtana" is basically a male dance form in which the performers play instruments, sing and dance. This follows the lines of the Samkirtana as shown by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in Bengal. In Manipur it has a very rich dance element along with singing and playing instruments. It is an energetic and acrobatic dance. The main instrument is a wooden drum, the "Pung", which looks like the clay "Khol" of Bengal. The sounds naturally vary. The dance with the "Pung", called the "Pung Cholom", is part of the "Samkirtana" in Manipur. The "Cholom" is a male dance form of Manipur. The name probably comes from the word "Chalan", meaning way of movement. There is also the "Kartal Cholom", where the movements are more grand and follow the sound and playing of the big cymbals, the "Kartalas". The singing, called the "ishei", follows the kirtana style of Bengal. Singers use a trembling tone which is typical of the Manipuri style of singing. The talas (rhythm patterns) used have an immense variety. There are 64 different talas for the Pung. These rhythmic patterns are also used in interesting combinations. The costumes are white, but the turbans vary with the instrument players. The "Samkirtana" is performed at all major occasions in the society, such as birth ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. It is even performed before the beginning of the "Rasalila".

The "Rasalila" of Manipur is said to be one of the higlights of India culture. It is through the Rasalila that the people of Manipur reach the highest bliss of worship. Following the "Srimadbhagavata", the core text of Chaitanite Vaishnavism, the first "Rasalila Maharas" was composed in 1779. The story as laid down in the Bhagavata was performed in the temple. A "Rasamandali", a circular dance area, was built outside the temple and people sat around it to watch the "Rasalila". This still happens in the Govindaji temple beside the Palace of the Kings. The success of this "Rasalila" made Raja Bhagyachandra (ruler from 1755 to 1789) try composing other Rasalilas such as the "Vasantarasa" and "Kunjarasa". The "Nityaras" and "Divarasa" are later developments of the Rasalila. The performances of the "Maharasa", "Vasantarasa" and "Kunjarasa" are fixed in the year, but "Nityarasa" can be performed at anytime of the year. Later kings continued to develop and compose dances. Raja Gambhir Singh (1781—1833) introduced acting the stories of child Krishna in Goparasa and Udukhalrasa. The time of Raja Chandrakirti (1831—1886) can claim to be the golden age of the evolution of Manipuri dance. 

Other dances of Manipur are performed during festivals like "Rathayatra", "Holi", and "Kwakjatra". All these dances are about religious devotion. The songs that are sung with these dances speak of the glory of Krishna and Radha. The main instruments are the Pung and flute.

The technique of Manipuri dance is probably the most graceful of all the classical dances of India. The body follows the path of 8 and the feet movements generate light touch on the ground. The face has a subdued expression while the eyes mostly express the "bhaktirasa" or the emotion of devotion. There are two styles of this dance form: the "tandava" and the "lasya". In "tandava", we have the "Cholom tandava" done by men and the Krishna "tandava", which is a counter part of the "lasya" technique in "Rasalila". The lasya is a very graceful style in Manipur. Rabindranath Tagore used this technique for the female characters in his dance dramas. 

The emotional part of this dance form follows the rasa theory as written in the Vaishnava texts. The "pancharasa"- "shanta", "dasya", "sakhya", "vatsalya" and "madhura"- are the main emotions on which the Vaishnavite Manipuri Dance is based. 

Manipur stands apart from all the Indian Classical dances for the beautiful costumes of the Rasalila, which is a unique creation of the people of Manipur. Religion and art have merged completely in the making of dance in Manipur. Even today one cannot identify Manipuri dance without the presence of the gods Krishna and Radha.

Each match had six wrestler in it: the defending champion and five challengers. Sheamus defended the WWE Championship against Triple H, Ted DiBiase, Randy Orton, John Cena, and Kofi Kingston in the Raw Elimination Chamber. In the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match, The Undertaker defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Chris Jericho, John Morrison, Rey Mysterio, CM Punk and R-Truth. On the undercard, Drew McIntyre defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Kane, The Miz defended the WWE United States Championship against Montel Vontavious Porter, and Maryse and Gail Kim wrestled against Team Lay-Cool (Layla and Michelle McCool) in a tag team match.

It was named by paleontologist Jose Bonaparte in 1991. It walked on two legs, had a long tail, and its leg structure suggests that it was a fast runner. It may have eaten insects. It was more primitive than other, better-known members of its family, such as "Mononykus" and "Shuvuuia". 

"Alvarezsaurus" was featured in the Discovery Channel television series "Dinosaur Planet", which speculated that it was a predator of young "Saltasaurus" , although these species did not exist at the same time, "Alvarezsaurus" being about 5 million years older than "Saltasaurus".

However, the skull is damaged, causing some paleontologists to speculate that it was involved in a fight shortly before it died.

This dinosaur was featured in the Discovery Channel series "Dinosaur Planet", where it was depicted as a pack hunter and ate the sauropod "Saltasaurus". In the episode, the head injury discovered in the type specimen was interpreted as being crushed by a stumbling "Saltasaurus".

Tornado drill

A tornado drill is something people do to practice what they would do if there were a tornado. It is usually done in a building such as a school or office. It starts with a signal such as an alarm or a spoken message over an intercom. After they hear the signal, people in the building go to a certain part of the building. This is usually a room deep inside the building (probably near the middle), or a hallway with no windows. They then get into a safe position. This might include kneeling on the ground with their hands over their heads.

In some places, schools have to have tornado drills, but usually not as often as fire drills. Tornado drills happen more in places where there are more tornadoes, such as in the Midwestern United States.

In the United States, most states in the Midwest and South have a statewide tornado drill in late winter or early spring to get ready for the severe weather season. During these drills, the National Weather Service gives out test tornado warnings, and local Emergency Alert Systems and/or NOAA Weather Radio (normally as a weekly or monthly test) are sounded, along with outdoor warning sirens. Schools and businesses may also have a tornado drill.

Android

An Android is a robot that looks very similar to humans. In TV shows and movies, androids are usually represented by human actors without special effects, while robots are usually shown in clunky suits or in makeup. Interestingly, androids in media tend to be meaner and colder than obvious robots. This is because the audience needs something to identify the android by, so they know it's an android.

In real life, androids do exist-- but they are inhuman and tend to look scary, falling into the Uncanny Valley.

ISO 21482

ISO 21482 is a norm that specifies a warning symbol to warn against the dangers of radiation. The warning is made of the trefoil on the top, which warns against radiations. There are lines towards the bottom. On the bottom left, there is a skull, which warns against poison. On the bottom right, there is a running figure, and an arrow pointing outside the sign. The color red was chosen because children said it expresses danger better than yellow. The Gallup Organization recommended the symbol, after showing it to 1650 people. 

The new symbol does not replace the old one, but it amends it. It was designed to show the danger of radiation to people who do not know about radiation, or who do not know the symbol for it. The symbol was developed because of nuclear accidents that happened because people opened containers with radioactive materials, such as the Goiânia accident in 1987, or the Samut Prakan disaster near Bangkok in 2000. The new symbol will not be placed on the containers. Rather, it will directly placed on the substances emmitting radiation, of the highest categories, 1 to 3. Containers will continue to bear only the old symbol, as they do not pose a direct risk. This also applies to rooms with radiation sources or x-ray equipment in them.

Banchan

Banchan (also known as panch'an), is a word for small dishes of food. They are served with cooked rice in Korean cuisine. The main dishes that are eaten are "bap" (밥, cooked rice), "guk", or "tang" (soup), "gochujang" or "ganjang", "jjigae", and "kimchi". The table setting is called "3 cheop" (삼첩), "5 cheop" (오첩), "7 cheop" (칠첩), "9 cheop" (구첩), "12 cheop" (십이첩) "bansang". This depends on the number of "banchan" there is. In Korean royal cuisine, the table setting is "12 cheop".

"Banchan" are put on the middle of the table and usually shared, though "guk" (soup) is not shared. Banchan are served little by little. They are meant to be finished at each meal, and more is added if there is not enough. Often, the more formal the meals are, the more "banchan" there will be. Jeolla province is quite famous for serving many differnt kinds of "banchan" in a single meal.

Hanja

Hanja is the Korean word for Chinese characters. It is about the Chinese characters that are borrowed from the Chinese language and used in the Korean language with Korean pronunciation. "Hanja-mal" or "hanja-eo" is about words which can be written with hanja. "Hanmun" (한문) is about the Chinese Classical writing, but "hanja" can sometimes be used to generally mean "hanmun" too. Hanja was never very greatly changed, so many of the Chinese characters are often entirely the same as traditional Chinese. Only a few hanja characters are unique to Korea.

In the 1440s, however, a Korean alphabet relying on sound was made by a group of scholars, led by King Sejong the Great. It was not widely used at first. However, by the early 19th and 20th century it was more widely used than "hanja", and it is now the official language of Korea.

But until then, everyone mostly read and wrote in "hanja", so most of the older books in Korean literature are written in hanja. Scholars who learn Korean history learn hanja to read historical papers. Children in Korea still learn hanja, for many Korean words still have roots in hanja.

A Korean meal almost always includes either a "jjigae" or a "guk" (국, soup). In the Joseon Dynasty "jjigae" was called "jochi".

Different kinds of "jjigae" are often called according to their main ingredients such as "saengseon jjigae" (생선찌개). "Saengseon" means fish. "Dubu jjigae" (두부찌개) is made from "dubu" (that is, tofu).

Fumigation is the making of toxic fumes. It may be done for several reasons. The most common use is to kill insects that hide in various places in a house or other building. There are a few steps to fumigate. First, the house or room is sealed. Then the fumigant (substance making fumes) is placed in the area. Then the fumigant is left to flow through the area. Finally, the fumigant is released before the people move back in. The gases are very toxic and the person fumigating has to make sure no one goes into the fumigation area or they might get poisoned.

Constitutional economics

Constitutional economics is a program of joint study of economics and . It is often described as "the economic analysis of constitutional law." Constitutional economics tries to explain the selection of different constitutional rules "limiting the choices and activities of economic and political agencies." This is different from the approach of traditional economics. Also, constitutional economics studies how well economic decisions of the state agree with the existing constitutional economic rights of its citizens." For example, proper distribution of economic and financial resources of the state is a big question for every nation. Constitutional economics helps finding a legal mechanism to solve this problem.

The term “constitutional economics” was created in 1982 by the U.S. economist Richard McKenzie. Then it was used by another American economist – – as a name for a new academic sub-discipline. It was Buchanan’s work on this sub-discipline that in 1986 brought him the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his "development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making."

Buchanan rejects "any organic conception of the state" as superior in wisdom, to the citizens of this state." This philosophical position forms the basis of constitutional economics. Buchanan believes that every constitution is created for at least several generations of citizens. Therefore, it must be able to balance interests of the state, society, and each individual. 

There exists an important opinion by Ludwig Van den Hauwe that constitutional economics can be regarded as the modern "science of legislation." 

The constantly growing public interest in constitutional economics has already brought to life several academic journals, such as, for example, "Constitutional Political Economy" (established in 1990).

The U.S. judge Richard Posner stresses the important role of state constitution in the . He asserts that "effective protection of basic economic rights promotes economic growth."

The Supreme Court of India used practical interpretation of the Indian Constitution to protect the poorest and most oppressed groups of the population in several cases of . This is a good example of real life application of the methodology of constitutional economics.

In the English language, the word "constitution", in addition to meaning "", often refers to the set of basic principles that a commercial, religious or public organization is governed by. This understanding is reflected in a broader approach which is characteristic of the Western school of constitutional economics. As opposed to that, the Russian school of constitutional economics, created at the turn of Millennium, focuses entirely on the concept of state constitution. The Russian model of constitutional economics tries bringing together constitutional economic rights of the citizens and economic policy of the state. In 2006, the has officially recognized constitutional economics as a separate academic sub-discipline. 

Constitutional economics pays special attention to such topic as proper national wealth distribution. Many countries with changing or developing economic systems still regard their constitutions as abstract legal documents having nothing in common with actual economic policy of the state. Three quarters of all independent states are still living under nearly absolute state control of the national economy. Neither nor individual citizens in these states have any influence on the decisions taken in the process of national wealth distribution. Therefore, constitutional economics is especially important for the countries whose political and economic systems are in transition and where the state rarely (if ever) respects constitutional economic rights of its citizens.

FIA Super Licence

The FIA Super Licence is a qualification allowing the licence (license) holder to take part in Formula One Grands Prix as a driver. The licence is issued by the FIA upon request.

There are several requirements to qualify for an FIA Super Licence. The driver requesting the licence must already have a Grade A competition licence. They must also meet the requirements of the FIA International Sporting Code, Appendix L. Appendix L lists other racing experience required. One of the following is required:

In rare and special cases, Appendix L allows the FIA to award a Super Licence to a driver who does not meet the normal requirements. A yes vote by all the members is required. The driver must also completed 300 kilometres of testing at racing speeds in a current car.

The nationality that appears on the racing licence is the same one that appears on the driver's passport. This does not need to be the same as the country issuing the racing licence. A Frenchman living in Germany can race with a German licence, but the nationality displayed would still be French. In order to race as German, the driver would need to have German nationality as well. For drivers with multiple citizenships, the driver chooses which country to drive for.

Kijiji ( ; , Swahili for "village") is a centralized network of online groups of people for posting local online classified advertisements. It is a subsidiary of eBay launched in March 2005. Kijiji is currently available for more than 300 cities in Germany. Further Kijiji countries are France, Italy, Canada, China, India, Taiwan, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, and Japan. Kijiji was made available to selected cities in the United States on June 29, 2007, under the name of "eBay Classifieds".

Kijiji offers similar services and is seen as a competitor to Craigslist with the biggest exception being that Kijiji has quite an extensive pets section. Kijiji's owner eBay is also a minority shareholder in Craigslist. In April 2008 eBay launched a lawsuit against Craigslist claiming that their executives were attempting to weaken eBay's investment, while in May of the same year, Craigslist filed a countersuit claiming Kijiji had stolen trade secrets and that eBay used misleading tactics to promote the service.

In November 2004, eBay acquired Marktplaats.nl, which offers a similar classifieds service in the Netherlands, holding an 80% market share.

At that time, Marktplaats.nl had set out into Spain, Germany, Turkey and Canada under the name of Intoko. Intoko Spain merged with Loquo, Intoko Germany merged with Kijiji Germany and Intoko Canada merged with Kijiji Canada. Intoko Turkey transferred to the Kijiji platform and is currently operating as "intoko.kijiji.com.tr".

In May 2005, eBay bought Gumtree, which offers a similar service for cities in the UK, Ireland, Poland, Hong Kong, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the Spanish company Loquo. One month later, it acquired OpusForum.org, another website offering online classifieds in Germany. In July 2006, Klaus Gapp, the founder of OpusForum, noted that, after its acquisition, it had "merged with its new Kijiji classifieds business in the German speaking markets of Austria, Germany and Switzerland." In August 2008, Kijiji re-branded their India site to Quikr.com.

The Kijiji Germany website has changed its name to eBay Kleinanzeigen.

In March 2010, eBay unveiled a new classifieds site, called eBay Classifieds, to replace its old site, Kijiji, in the United States.

<doc id="261820" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=261820" title="Struggle for existence">
Struggle for existence

The struggle for existence is a natural history metaphor. It refers to the competition between animals to survive. It was first used by the Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus, and again by Charles Darwin, and Alfred Russel Wallace.

The idea is much older, and many natural historians have noted the competition between animals. Generally speaking, they have been interested in the competition between species. Malthus was probably the first to think about the struggle for resources between members of one species – the human species.

Darwin first heard about Malthus in letters from his sister Fanny, while he was voyaging on H.M.S. "Beagle". Fanny told him Malthus' ideas were being promoted by Harriet Martineau, an early feminist writer. Later on, back in London, Darwin met Martineau over dinner, and put a lot of thought into the ideas of Malthus. The number of humans could double in 25 years. If they did not, it was because of competition for resources, such as food, or because wars and disease became more common.

Darwin began to realise that every species of living thing has the potential to increase geometrically (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 ...), yet that does not happen in practice. Later, he combined these ideas with two more. One was the idea that, in the struggle, some would be better suited than others to succeed. The other idea was heredity: that the characteristics must be at least partly inherited. This led to his idea of evolution by means of natural selection. Wallace independently came to the same conclusion.

Darwin used the phrase 'struggle for existence' as the title of the third chapter of his "Origin of Species" in 1859. The old idea was now fitted into a complete theory.

Shays' Rebellion

Shays' Rebellion was a rebellion in central and western Massachusetts (mainly Springfield) from 1786 to 1787. The rebellion is named after Daniel Shays, a veteran of the American Revolution who led the rebels, also known as "Shaysites" or "Regulators". Most of the Shaysites were poor farmers angered by their debt and taxes. They couldn't pay their taxes, and they were afraid of going to jail or having their homes taken away from them.

They attempted to stop the courts from taking property from indebted farmers by forcing the closure of courts in western Massachusetts. The participants in Shays' Rebellion believed they were acting in the spirit of the Revolution and modeled their tactics after the crowd activities of the 1760s and 1770s, using "liberty poles" and "liberty trees" to symbolize their cause. 

The rebellion started on August 29, 1786, and by January 1787, over 1000 Shaysites had been arrested. A militia that had been raised as a private army defeated an attack on the federal Springfield Armory by the main Shaysite force on February 3, 1787. Shays' Rebellion produced fears that the Revolution’s democratic impulse had gotten out of hand.

Cooking Channel

Cooking Channel is a television channel that replaced Fine Living Network from May 31, 2010. The channel is owned by Scripps Networks Interactive, is a spinoff (in association) of Food Network, also owned by SNI, but the channel will focus more on instructional programs than "reality style" and programming competions that Food Network is now geared towards. The original plan was to implement the change in the fall of 2010, but it was later announced that the switch was being moved up to May 31, 2010 to happen with Memorial Day in the United States. Cooking Channel launched a high-definition feed and channel on June 30, 2010. The channel has also announced it eventually will offer an on demand version.

Many of Food Network's top chefs and celebrities - Emeril Lagasse, Rachael Ray and Bobby Flay - will have new programs on the channel starting in the fall of 2010. Lagasse's new show, called "Emeril's Fresh Food Fast", will show viewers how fresh food can be prepared in a several amount of time without the authentic taste. Flay's new show, called "Bruch @ Bobby's" will focus on Weekend bruches, and Ray's show called "Week In a Day" will show viewers how to plan a week's menu by cooking them all in a single day. The channel will also carry the new "post-game" show for "The Next Food Network Star". Shows airing in replays will come from cooks in Canada and Great Britain, such as Food Network Canada host David Rocco, who will host the self-titled "David Rocco's Dolce Vita" and Irish chef Rachel Allen with "". The remaining shows are replays of:"Chuck's Day Off", "Chinese Food Made Easy", "Everyday Exotic", "French Food at Home", "Drink Up", "Food(ography)", "Food Jammers", "Spice Goddess", "Indian Food Made Easy", "Caribbean Food Made Easy", "FoodCrafters", "Unique Eats", "Nigella Express", "Bill's Food", "Iron Chef" (original Japanese version), "Julia Child and The Galloping Gourmet", "Two Fat Ladies", and "Tyler's Ultimate".

Social Security

Social Security is the name given to programs to provide money to people who need it. In Europe, the term is very similar to welfare. In the United States, it refers to a program started in the New Deal. The program first gave money only to a few old people, but is now used by millions of people and is one of the largest and most costly programs in the federal government. Social Security in the United States is managed by the Social Security Administration, and a person in the program gets a number and has it forever, mainly because of tax reports.

Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights law ensure such Security as "right to adequate standard of living" as one of the human rights.

Romy Schneider

Romy Schneider (September 23, 1938 - May 29, 1982) was an Austrian actress. She had an international career, but worked mostly in France.

She was born Rosemarie Albach-Retty in Vienna, Austria. Her parents were Wolf Albach-Retty (1906-1967) and Magda Schneider (1909-1996), both famous actors in Austria and Germany. 

After her parents divorced in 1945, she was raised by her mother. With her mother's help, and using her mother's family name, she started acting in 1953. She quickly became very popular through Ernst Marischka's trilogy called "Sissi", about the early life of Empress Elisabeth of Austria.

In 1958, she appeared in the movie "Christine", opposite French actor Alain Delon. They became engaged and she moved to France with him.

Schneider worked with directors such as Luchino Visconti in "Boccacio" (1961), Orson Welles in "The Trial" (1962), and Otto Preminger in "The Cardinal" (1963).

After her breakup with Delon in 1964, she went back to Germany. There she married stage director Harry Meyen. They had a son named David (1966-1981). 

She acted with Delon again in the movie "La piscine" in 1969. The rest of her career was mostly in France. Notable movies included; "Les choses de la vie" (1970), "Max et les ferrailleurs" (1971), "Le trio infernal" (1974), "Le vieux fusil" (1975), "La banquière" (1980), "La passante du Sans-Souci" (1981). 

Her later years were plagued by personal tragedies. She gave birth to a stillborn child in 1976 by her second husband Daniel Biasini. Her first husband Harry Meyen killed himself in 1979. Her son David accidentally died impaled while trying to go over a fence in 1981. That same year she had a kidney operation. 

She was found dead in her Paris apartment at the age of 43, probably from a heart attack, although no autopsy was performed. She left a daughter Sarah Biasini (born 1977, by her second husband), who is now also an actress.

John Alcock (bishop)

John Alcock (c. 1430 – 1 October 1500) was an English churchman.

He was born at Beverley in Yorkshire, son of Sir William Alcock, Burgess of Kingston upon Hull and educated at Cambridge. In 1461 he was made dean of Westminster, and his subsequent promotion was rapid in both church and state. In 1461 he was made "Master of the Rolls", and in 1470 was sent as ambassador to the court of Castile. He became Bishop of Rochester on 15 March, Bishop of Worcester on 15 July 1476 and of Ely on 6 October 1486. He was Lord Chancellor, once from June 1475 to September 1475 and then again from October 1485 to March 1487.

Alcock was one of the leading pre-Reformation churchmen; he was a man of deep learning and also a great architect. He founded a charity at Beverley and a grammar school at Kingston upon Hull. He restored many churches and colleges, but his greatest achievement was the building of Jesus College, Cambridge.

Alcock died on 1 October 1500 and lies buried in the Alcock Chantry in Ely Cathedral.

Lord Chancellor

The Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, or Lord Chancellor is a senior and important functionary in the government of the United Kingdom. He is the second highest ranking of the Great Officers of State after the Lord High Steward. The Lord Chancellor is appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister. Before the Union there were separate Lord Chancellors of England and Scotland.

The Lord Chancellor is responsible for the efficient functioning and independence of the courts. The current Lord Chancellor is Kenneth Clarke, who as with his predecessor Jack Straw is also Secretary of State for Justice. Clarke holds the position, as did Straw, while serving as a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons. 

Formerly, there were separate Chancellors of England, Scotland and Ireland. When the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain under the Acts of Union 1707 the offices of the Chancellor of England and the Lord Chancellor of Scotland were combined to form a single office of Lord Chancellor for the new state.

Thomas Robert Malthus

Thomas Robert Malthus FRS (13 February 1766 – 23 December 1834), was a British writer on political economy and population. Malthus popularised the economic theory of rent, and was the first to use the phrase "struggle for existence".

Malthus is famous for his theories about population: its increase or decrease in response to various factors. There were six editions of his "An Essay on the Principle of Population", published from 1798 to 1826. He said that sooner or later population gets checked, by famine, disease, and widespread mortality. 

He wrote in opposition to many who saw society as improving, and (in principle) as perfectible. William Godwin and the Marquis de Condorcet, for example, believed in the possibility of almost limitless improvement of society. So, in a more complex way, did Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose notions centered on the goodness of man and the liberty of citizens bound only by the social contract.

Malthus thought that the dangers of population growth would prevent endless progress towards a utopian society: 
As an Anglican clergyman, Malthus saw this situation as divinely imposed to teach virtuous behaviour. Believing that one could not change human nature, Malthus wrote: 

Malthus placed the longer-term stability of the economy above short-term expediency. He criticised the Poor Laws, and (alone among important contemporary economists) supported the Corn Laws, which introduced a system of taxes on British imports of wheat. He thought these measures would encourage domestic production, and so promote long-term benefits. 

Malthus became hugely influential, and controversial, in economic, political, social and scientific thought. Many evolutionary biologists read him, especially Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. For both of them, Malthusianism became a stepping-stone to the idea of natural selection. Malthus is still a writer of great significance and controversy.

Earth is a planet. It is the planet on which we live. It is the third planet of the solar system. 71% of the surface of earth is covered with water. Earth has one moon.

Please add some text, easier than level 3, but more encyclopaedic than level 1

Earth is the planet we live on. It has only one Moon. Every 365 days it revolves around the Sun which provides light. Earth rotates so each part of it is in light during the day and dark at night. The Moon revolves but the same side of it is always facing Earth. It has phases of the Moon which are caused by the position of the Earth compared with the Moon and the Sun : if the Earth is between them, the moon appears illuminated and if the Earth is "behind" the Moon, it appears dark. The lunar calendar is based on this.

Earth has air that we live in, water that we drink, and much light reaches it from the sun. Everything alive needs these, so Earth is at least rare, and it cannot be easily replaced. It has many ecosystems that provide nature's services to humans. The value of these, when measured, is natural capital. Unlike any other style of capital, there is no known way to replace this - but it can be improved, regrown, protected, for example by conservation.

Ideally, Level 0.5 lessons should cover all the words in Basic English, using the minimum number of pages. This is an excrutiatingly difficult task, but the Wikipedia software looks as if it might make it possible. Wikipedia software has lots and lots of cross-links which according to the Special pages can be sorted and view in many different ways.

It an author was asked to use the set of word "It is/it's/its" in the one page, the answer would surely be "easier said than done".

Littoral zone

The littoral zone refers to that part of a sea, lake or river which is close to the shore. In coastal environments the littoral zone extends from the high water mark, which is rarely under water, to shoreline areas that are permanently submerged. It always includes this intertidal zone and is often used to mean the same as the intertidal zone. However, the meaning of "littoral zone" can extend well beyond the intertidal zone.

In oceanography and marine biology, the idea of the littoral zone is extended roughly to the edge of the continental shelf.

<doc id="261917" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=261917" title="Collective animal behaviour">
Collective animal behaviour

Collective animal behaviour describes and analyzes the behaviour of groups of animals. In these groups, the animals are often all of the same species. As an example, a school of fish will be made of mostly the same type of fish and a flock of birds will have the same type of bird. A herd is a large group of hoofed, herbivorous mammals.

Animals tend to behave in such a way because this behaviour offers them a benefit. The group of animals also behaves differently from a single animal. Collective animal behaviour is about finding the rules each animal follows; how it communicates with other members of the group and how a decision to do something is reached in the group.

Full-time colonial animals fall into this category in principle, but in practice the species of interest here are those who form temporary groups. Colonial animals have been researched for many years, and are usually based on some kind of family relationship. Temporary collective behavior is a well-known phenomenon, but little researched until now.

Different functions have been proposed, as follows:

1. "Protection from predators".

2. "Better foraging": A school of fish or a group of animals is better at foraging. 

3. "Easier movement": Groups of animals moving together (such as fish or birds) save energy. Many of the larger birds fly in flocks. Flying in flocks helps in reducing the energy needed. Many large birds fly in a V-formation, which helps individuals save 12–20 % of the energy they would need to fly alone. Red Knots "Calidris canutus" and Dunlins "Calidris alpina" were found in radar studies to fly 5 km per hour faster in flocks than when they were flying alone.

4. "Social interaction": This can be seen with fish, such as Herring. If an animal is separated from the group, it will feel stressed.

5. Special factors come into play with migrating birds, or birds which gather in huge flocks, such as starlings. Bird behavior has a larger component of learning than fish. In addition to factors listed above is the possibility that migrating bird flocks are good at teaching first-year birds how to do the migration successfully. The specific routes may be genetically programmed or learned to varying degrees. The routes taken on forward and return migration are often different.

The usual term for insects which are not always in a fixed colony, but move in large numbers is swarm. There are many good examples. Army ants for example. The best researched is the locust.

Locusts are the swarming phase of short-horned grasshoppers of the family Acrididae. These are species that can breed rapidly under suitable conditions. Then they come together in large groups and migratory. They form bands as nymphs and swarms as adults—both of which can travel great distances, rapidly stripping fields and greatly damaging crops.

There is no taxonomic difference between locust and grasshopper species, and in English the term "locust" is used for grasshopper species that change morphologically and behaviourally on crowding, to form swarms or hopper bands. These changes, or phase polymorphism, were first thought of as separate species. 

Research at Oxford University showed that swarming is a response to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily. The transformation of the locust to the swarming variety is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. It is estimated that the largest swarms have covered hundreds of square miles and consisted of many billions of locusts. Plagues of locusts appear in both the Bible and the Koran, including one of the biblical Plagues of Egypt, where locusts ate all the crops of Egypt.

Often, animals are thought to follow simple rules, such as
Recent studies have shown that an animal only picks five to seven other animals, and aligns with them. This seems to be independent of the distance. Another possible approach at modelling is to say that all animals within a certain distance are kept track of for alignment.

Mercury(II) chloride, also known as mercuric chloride and corrosive sublimate, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is HgCl. It has mercury and chloride ions in it. The mercury is in its +2 oxidation state. 

It is a white crystalline solid. It is very toxic. It can be made by reacting chlorine with mercury. It is not ionic, like most metal-nonmetal chemical compounds are. For example, it evaporates easily when heated, while ionic compounds like sodium chloride stay solid. It dissolves in water, but much better in hot water than in cold water. It also dissolves in chloride solutions. It is very corrosive and a strong oxidizing agent. It reacts with bases to make mercury(II) oxide.

It can be made by reacting mercury(I) chloride or mercury metal with chlorine. It can also be made by reacting mercury(I) nitrate with hydrochloric acid or by reacting mercury(II) sulfate with sodium chloride. 

It is used as a catalyst in making plastics. It is also used to make an amalgam with metals such as aluminum. It was used in the past to preserve various things and as a medicine. It is too toxic to be used as a medicine anymore. It was used in photography.

Mercury(I) chloride

Mercury(I) chloride, also known as calomel and mercurous chloride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is HgCl. It has mercury and chloride ions in it. The mercury is in its +1 oxidation state.

It is a white to pale yellow crystalline solid. It is toxic, but not as toxic as mercury(II) chloride because it does not dissolve in water. It turns back into mercury and mercury(II) chloride when reacted with ammonia or exposed to ultraviolet light. The black color that came from the reaction with ammonia gave its name "calomel" (beautiful black). It is a weak reducing agent. It is the most common mercury(I) compound.

Calomel is sometimes found as a mineral, but it is quite rare.

It is made by reacting mercury with mercury(II) chloride. It can also be made by reacting mercury(I) nitrate with sources of chloride, such as sodium chloride. 

It is used in electrochemistry as a reference electrode. Reference electrodes are used to find the electrode potentials (ability to be oxidized and reduced) of other chemical substances. Since it decomposes when light is shined on it, it is used to see how many photons are in a light beam. It was used as medicine in the past, although it was toxic.

Inline-four engine

The Inline-four engine or Straight-four is an internal combustion engine with all four cylinders. All four cylinders are mounted in a straight line along one crankshaft. It can be powered by different types of fuels, including gasoline, diesel and natural gas.

The single bank of cylinders may be in a vertical direction (straight up), or at an angle. When the cylinders are mounted at an angle, it is sometimes called a slant-four. When listed as an abbreviation, an inline-four engine is listed either as I4 or L4 (for "longitudinal"). L4 is often used to avoid confusion between the digit 1 and the letter I.

The inline-four layout is a mechanically simple engine. It has a natural basic engine balance. It is smoother than one, two, and three cylinder engines. This makes it popular for economy cars. It does have a problem with secondary engine balance. This causes minor vibrations in smaller engines. These vibrations become worse as engine size and power increase. The more powerful engines used in larger cars use different a engine layout to avoid this problem.

This inline-four gasoline configuration is the most common in cars with a displacement (engine size) up to 2.4 L. Porsche used a 3.0 L four in its 944 S2 and 968 sports cars. Antique vehicles tended to have larger displacements to develop horsepower and torque. The Model A Ford was built with a 3.3 L inline-four engine.

Four-cylinder diesel engines are lower revving than gasoline engines. They often exceed 3.0 L. Toyota made a 4.1 L diesel engine that was used in the Toyota Mega Cruiser. Larger four-cylinder engines are used in industrial applications, are often made with displacements up to about 4.6 L.

Displacement can also be very small. Some cars sold in Japan have engines that are only 660 cc.

The 1913 Indianapolis 500 was won by Jules Goux driving a Peugeot. This car was powered by an inline-four engine designed by Ernest Henry. This design was big influence for racing engines. It was the first to use dual overhead camshafts (DOHC) and four valves per cylinder. This became the standard design for racing inline-four engines.

This Peugeot was sold to the American driver "Wild Bob" Burman. Burman broke the engine in 1915. Because of World War I, Peugeot couldn't deliver a new engine. Burman asked Harry Arminius Miller to build a new engine. With John Edward and Fred Offenhauser, Miller created a new engine. Its design was based on the Peugeot inline-four engine. This was the first version of the engine that would dominate the Indianapolis 500 until 1976. At first, the engine was named Miller. Later it became known as Offenhauser. The Offenhauser engines won five straight races at Indianapolis from 1971 to 1976. It was not until 1981 that engines such as the Cosworth V8 engine eliminated them.

Many cars produced for the pre-WWII voiturette Grand Prix motor racing used inline-four engine designs. These cars were rebuilt and reused after the war. They formed the beginnings of what is now Formula One.

Modern inline-four motorcycle engines first gained their popularity with Honda's single overhead camshaft CB750 in the 1970s. The inline-four has become one of the most common engine configurations in street bikes The inline-four is common because of its relatively high performance-to-cost ratio. All of the Japanese motorcycle manufacturers offer motorcycles with inline-four engines.

Anthony Rolfe Johnson

Anthony Rolfe Johnson, CBE (born 5 November 1940; died 21 July 2010) was an English operatic tenor. He was especially famous for singing the music of Monteverdi, Mozart and Benjamin Britten. He sang many of the operatic roles which Britten had written for Peter Pears to sing.

Anthony Rolfe Johnson was born in Tackley in Oxfordshire. When he was a child he enjoyed singing, but did not think of taking it up as a career. He started to work in farm management. Then, in his late twenties, he decided to study singing at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He started his singing career by singing in operas in the chorus and in small roles at the Glyndebourne Festival between 1972 and 1976. His first big operatic part was Vaudémont in Tchaikovsky’s "Iolanthe" in 1973 with the English Opera Group. Then he sang the part of Albert Herring in Britten’s opera.

In 1978 he joined English National Opera. He sang several roles in Mozart and Monteverdi operas, then he sang the Male Chorus (a solo part) in Britten’s "The Rape of Lucretia" and Aschenbach in "Death in Venice". Later he sang the title role in "Peter Grimes". He sang in opera houses all over the world, including including the English National Opera, Royal Opera House, La Monnaie in Brussels, La Scala, Milan, the Metropolitan Opera, New York, the Vienna State Opera, and the Paris Opera.

Rolfe Johnson sang other music besides operas. He sang in several oratorios, and he sang the role of Evangelist in J. S. Bach's "St John Passion" and "St Matthew Passion", as well as in Britten’s "War Requiem". He also sang on the concert platform, and he gave recitals of Lieder. He helped to found a group called “The Songmakers’ Almanac” who sang classical songs. .

He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1992. 

He died of Alzheimer's disease on 21 July 2010.

Guildhall School of Music and Drama

Guildhall School of Music and Drama is a school for music and drama in London, England. It was founded in 1880. Students can study Music, Opera, Drama, Stage Management and Technical Theatre.

The first Guildhall School was in an old warehouse, but it was soon too small. A new building was especially built and opened in 1886. Before 1935 it was known as the Guildhall School of Music. Since 1977 it has been next to the Barbican Arts Centre in the Barbican Complex.

The Guildhall School does not just teach students at the school. They also organize music examinations in the whole of Britain for anyone learning musical instruments. In 2004 these examinations joined with those of Trinity College London to form Trinity Guildhall Examinations. Today, Trinity Guildhall offers qualifications in performing and teaching in music, speech and drama, and dance to external students (students who are not studying at the school).

Today the school has a 308-seat drama and opera theatre, concert hall, lecture / recital hall and a small studio theatre. The students of the school regularly perform all over London. In 2008 work began on a large extension to the School. It will cost about £90 million.

Famous musicians who studied there include the trumpeter Alison Balsom, the composer Thomas Adès, the flautist Sir James Galway, the pianist Paul Lewis, the violinist Tasmin Little and the singers Kate Royal and Bryn Terfel.

Starling

The Starlings are a family of small to medium-sized birds, the Sturnidae. This family are passerine songbirds, whose best-known species is "Sternus vulgaris", the common sparrow.

Starlings occur naturally in the Old World, from Europe, Asia and Africa, to northern Australia and the islands of the tropical Pacific. Several European and Asian species have been introduced to these areas as well as to North America, Hawaii and New Zealand. In these new areas they compete for habitat with native birds, and are invasive species. 

Starlings have strong feet, their flight is strong and direct, and they are very gregarious (social). Their preferred habitat is fairly open country, and they eat insects and fruit. Several species live around humans, and are effectively omnivores. Many species search for food by opening the bill after probing it into dense vegetation; this behavior is called 'open-bill probing'. Plumage is typically dark with a metallic sheen. Most species nest in holes, laying blue or white eggs.

Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called mynas, and many African species are known as glossy starlings because of their iridescent plumage.

Starlings have varied and complex songs, and may copy sounds from their surroundings, including car alarms, and human speech. The birds can recognize particular individuals by their calls.

North-East European starlings migrate, but in southern and western Europe the birds are resident. Starlings are generally a highly social family. Most species associate in flocks of varying sizes throughout the year. These flocks may include other species of starlings and sometimes species from other families. This sociality is obvious in their roosting behaviour. In the non-breeding season some roosts can number thousands of birds. Flocks in Britain used to number millions of birds, though numbers are now fewer than they used to be.

"Sternus vulgaris" is a highly gregarious species in autumn and winter. Flock size is variable: huge flocks are a spectacular sight and sound. These flocks often attract birds of prey such as Sparrowhawks. Flocks form a tight sphere-like formation in flight, frequently expanding and contracting and changing shape, seemingly without any leader. 

Very large roosts, sometimes up to 1.5 million birds, can form in city centres, woodlands, or reedbeds, causing problems with their droppings.
Huge flocks of more than a million Starlings are observed just before sunset in spring in southwestern Jutland, Denmark. There they gather in March until they leave for their breeding ranges by mid-April. Their flocking creates complex shapes against the sky, a phenomenon known locally as "Black Sun". To witness this spectacle, the best place are the seaward marshlands of Tønder and Esbjerg .

Flocks of anything from five to fifty thousand Starlings form in areas of the UK just before sundown during mid winter. These flocks are commonly called a Starling "Moot".


Although there are approximately 200 million starlings in North America, they are all descendants of 60 birds released in 1890 (and 40 more in 1891) in Central Park, New York, by Eugene Schieffelin. He was a member of the Acclimation Society of North America, which tried to introduce to North America every bird species mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare.

As an introduced species, European Starlings are not protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Starlings are considered a nuisance species in North America. The birds, which travel in enormous flocks, often pose dangers to air travel, disrupt cattle operations, chase off native birds, and roost on city blocks. They leave behind corrosive droppings and hundreds of millions of dollars of damage every year. In 2008, U.S. government agents poisoned, shot and trapped 1.7 million starlings, more than any other nuisance species.

It can be reacted with bases such as sodium hydroxide to produce a fluorosilicate salt such as sodium fluorosilicate. It is used to make artificial cryolite. It releases hydrogen fluoride when it is heated, so it is toxic like hydrofluoric acid. It is used in fluoridation of water.

Royal charter

A royal charter is a legal document issued by the monarchy which gives certain rights to an organization.

When an organization, for example: a university, is founded there has to be an official document which lists the basic laws (the constitution) of the organization. If this document is given to the organization by the king or queen it is called a Royal charter.

In Europe Royal charters have been used to create towns ever since the middle ages. The date when the charter was made is thought of as the date when the town was founded (started), even if there had been people living there many years before.

Many groups such as the British East India Company were formed by Royal charter. Most British university operate under Royal Charters. This gives them the right to give degrees to the students at the end of their studies. 

The BBC operates under a Royal Charter which lasts for a limited period of ten years, after which it is renewed.

Charities may also have Royal charters. They do not need to have one, but they are likely to be more successful if they have a Royal charter.

George Grove

Sir George Grove (born Clapham, South London, 13 August 1820; died Sydenham, 28 May 1900 was an English engineer and musician. He wrote books about classical composers and is particularly famous for his big musical dictionary "Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians". This dictionary continued to be updated and published after his death. It has now gone through seven editions. The latest edition is available online.

George Grove was born in Clapham in South London. His father sold fish. His mother was musical. He learned to be an engineer and was sent out to Jamaica to help to build a lighthouse. He worked on the building of the Britannia tubular bridge over the Menai Strait. He married the daughter of a clergyman. He became secretary of the Society of Arts and he wrote many articles for a Dictionary of the Bible. He spent seven years doing this. It gave him the idea of doing something similar for music.

Grove went to many concerts. He bought sheet music and studied it. He wrote programme notes for concerts, writing about the music that was being played. He wrote about a lot of music by Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn and Schumann. He wrote detailed essays about the symphonies of Beethoven and was a good friend of Clara Schumann. He travelled with the composer Arthur Sullivan to Vienna where he met many great musicians including Brahms and discovered some music by Schubert that had been forgotten. He spent several years writing his "Dictionary of Music" which was published in four volumes.

Grove worked very hard to get enough money to found the Royal College of Music which was opened in 1883 by the Prince of Wales. Grove got many great musicians to come and teach there, including the world-famous singer Jenny Lind who was already retired, and Hubert Parry, Charles Villiers Stanford and others. The prime minister William Gladstone gave him a knighthood for what he had done for music. The new students included many who were to become famous. These include Hamish MacCunn and Charles Wood. He became very fond of the student Edith Oldham and had an emotional attachment to her for the rest of his life. His wife was not interested in his work. He called his students his "children" and persuaded them to have a broad education. He wanted them to read a lot. He was director of the RCM for eleven years, retiring in 1894, just after the RCM moved into a new building which is situated on the south side of the Royal Albert Hall. The RCM is still there today.

George Grove was a very influential man for English music. Although he was not trained as a musician he became extremely knowledgeable and was an excellent musicologist. The RCM have a George Grove Memorial Scholarship in his memory.

Thurston Dart

Thurston Dart (born 3 September 1921; died 6 March 1971), was a British musicologist, conductor and keyboard player. He is particularly remembered for his books in which he wrote about how music from earlier centuries should be performed.

Dart studied keyboard instruments at the Royal College of Music in London from 1938 to 1939, and also studied mathematics at University College, Exeter, graduating in 1942. He became a music lecturer and later professor at the University of Cambridge. During his time at Cambridge, Dart did a lot of work for the early music revival. Musicians were becoming interested in playing music from the Baroque, Renaissance and even Middle Ages. He formed such groups as the Early Music Consort of London. In 1964 he became King Edward Professor of Music in the University of London (King's College).

Thurston Dart played the harpsichord in many concerts and made several gramophone recordings. He wrote a book "The Interpretation of Music" (London, 1954), which became very widely read. He wrote many articles in journals about music.

Dart taught many students, included some who later became famous: the composer Michael Nyman, conductor Sir John Eliot Gardiner and conductor/musicologist Christopher Hogwood. He was one of the first musicians to make a recording of Bach's "Brandenburg Concertos" using historical instruments.

Mercury compounds are chemical compounds containing mercury ions. One thing they have in common is that they are all toxic. The soluble ones are more toxic than the insoluble ones. Mercury forms compounds in the +1 and +2 oxidation states.

Also known as mercurous compounds, these are weak reducing agents and weak oxidizing agents. Most of them do not dissolve in water, making them less toxic than mercury(II) compounds. Most of them are colorless or yellow.


Also known as mercuric compounds, these are strong oxidizing agents. Most of them dissolve in water, making them very toxic. They are colorless or red.


These contain mercury reacted with a organic molecule. They are even more toxic than other mercury compounds since they get absorbed very easily.

<doc id="262148" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=262148" title="Turbocharger">
Turbocharger

A turbocharger, or turbo, is a gas compressor. It is used for to force air into an internal combustion engine. A turbocharger is a form of supercharger. It increases the density of air entering the engine to create more power. A turbocharger has the compressor powered by a turbine. The turbine is driven by the exhaust gas from the engine. It does not use a direct mechanical drive. This helps improve the performance of the turbocharger. 

Early builders of turbochargers called them as "turbosuperchargers". A supercharger is an air compressor used for forced air into an engine. They thought that by adding a turbine to turn the supercharger, it would yield a "turbosupercharger". The term was soon shortened to "turbocharger". This can now create some confusion. The term "turbosupercharged" is sometimes used to refer to an engine that uses both a crankshaft-driven supercharger and an exhaust-driven turbocharger. This is also called twincharging.

Some companies such as Teledyne Continental Motors still use the term "turbosupercharger" to refer to their turbochargers.

An engine creates power by burning a mixture of air and fuel. The air and fuel and put into the cylinders to burn. When they burn, they push the piston down. The piston turns the crankshaft and creates power. For car engines, this is measured "horsepower".

An engine that does not use a turbocharger or a supercharger is called a "naturally aspirated" or "normally aspirated" engine. Normally, when engine specifications are listed, a note is only made if the engine use a turbocharger or supercharger. Most car engines are naturally aspirated. The power they can create is limited by the amount of air the pistons can pull into the cylinders.

A turbocharger is a small fan pump that spins around a shaft. The pump is driven by the pressure of the exhaust gas. A turbocharger consists of a turbine and a compressor. They are both mounted on the same shaft. The turbine is a heat engine. It converts exhaust heat and pressure to rotation. This rotation is used to turn the compressor. The compressor takes in the draws in the outside air. It squeezes or compresses the air. It then sends the air to the engine. Because the air pressure has been increased, more air and fuel may be put into the cylinders. This is sometimes called "boost pressure".With more fuel to burn, the engine can create more power. This increases the "horsepower" of the engine.

The engine can be damaged if the air pressure in the cylinders gets too high. If there is too much exhaust gas sent to the turbine, the compressor can create too much pressure. To stop this from happening, a "wastegate" is used. The wastegate will limit amount of exhaust gas sent to the turbine.

The turbocharger was invented by Swiss engineer Alfred Büchi. His patent was applied for use in 1905. Diesel ships and locomotives with turbochargers began appearing in the 1920s.

During the First World War French engineer Auguste Rateau fitted turbochargers to Renault engines powering various French fighters with some success.

In 1918, General Electric engineer Sanford Moss attached a turbocharger to a "Liberty" aircraft engine. The engine was tested at Pikes Peak in Colorado at . The test was to show that the turbo could add the power airplanes lose at high altitude. Internal combustion engines lose power because at high altitude, the outside air pressure is low. Less air and fuel can be drawn into the engine.

Turbochargers were first used in production aircraft engines in the 1930s. 

The first turbocharged diesel truck was built by the "Swiss Machine Works Saurer" in 1938. The first production turbocharged automobile engines came from General Motors in 1962. The Oldsmobile Cutlass Jetfire was fitted with a Garrett AiResearch turbocharger and the Chevrolet Corvair Monza Spyder with a TRW turbocharger. 

In 1974, at Paris Auto Show, Porsche displayed the 911Turbo. This was during the height of the oil crisis. The 911Turbo was the first production sports car with exhaust turbocharger and pressure regulator. The pressure regulator was the wastegate.
The first production turbo diesel automobiles were the Mercedes 300SD with a Garrett turbocharger, and the Peugeot 604. Both were introduced in 1978. Today, most automotive diesels are turbocharged.

The first successful turbocharged racing engine appears to have been in 1952. Fred Agabashian in a diesel-powered Cummins Special qualified for the pole position at the Indianapolis 500. He led for . Then the turbo was damaged by tire debree. Offenhauser's turbocharged engines first came to Indianapolis in 1966. Their first victorie came in 1968 using a Garrett AiResearch turbocharger. Turbocharged cars dominated the 24 Hours of Le Mans between 1976 and 1988, and then from 2000-2007.
Formula One had a "Turbo Era" from until . Engines with a capacity of 1500 cc could produce as much as 1500 hp (1119 kW). In 1977, Renault was the first to use turbocharged engines F1. The performance made up for the high cost. Other engine manufacturers started building turbos. The turbocharged engines took over the F1 field. They ended the Ford Cosworth DFV era in the mid 1980s. the FIA decided that turbochargers were making the sport too dangerous and expensive. In 1987, the FIA decided to limit the maximum boost of the turbos. In 1989, turbochargers were banned completely.

World Rally Car racers have long preferred turbocharged engines. They offer a very high power-to-weight ratios. Turbo power started to rise to the levels of F1 cars. The FIA did not ban turbos. They restrict the turbo power by limiting the inlet diameter.

Some engines use two turbochargers. They will both be the same size. They are normally smaller than used on single-turbos engines. They are often used on V-type engines, such as V6s and V8s. Each turbo is powered by a separate exhaust pipe from the engine. Because they are smaller, they reach their optimal boost more quickly. This setup of turbos is normally called a parallel twin-turbo system. The first production car with parallel twin turbochargers was the Maserati Biturbo of the early 1980s. 

Some car builders aviod turbo lag (below) by using two small turbos. The normal setup is to have one turbo working all the time. The seconds turbo will only start working at higher RPM. Because the turbos are smaller, they do not have as much turbo lag. The second turbo will be able get to full speed before it is required. This setup is normally called a sequential twin-turbo. Porsche first used this technology in 1985 in the Porsche 959.

Turbocharging is very common on diesel engines in automobiles, trucks, locomotives, ships, and heavy machinery. Diesels are particularly suitable for turbochargers for several reasons:

Using turbochargers to increase performance was very appealing to the Japanese builders in the 1980s. The first example of a turbocharged motorcycle is the 1978 Kawasaki Z1R TC. It used a Rayjay ATP turbo kit to build 0.35 bar (5 lb) of boost. This raised the power up from to . It was only slightly faster than the standard model. Several other motorcycles were built with turbos. Turbo applications for motorcycles increased their price. The small gains in performance were not worth the extra cost. Since the mid 1980s, no manufactures have produced turbocharged motorcycles.

A natural use of the turbocharger is with aircraft engines. As an aircraft climbs to higher altitudes, the pressure of the surrounding air quickly decreases. A turbocharger fixes this problem by compressing the air to higher pressures. 

Compressing the air increases its temperature. This causes several problems. Increased temperatures can lead to engine knock because of increased cylinder head temperatures. Hot air cannot burn as much fuel as cold air. This will decrease the power produced. 

The common method of dealing with the hotter air is to cool it. The most common way is to use an inter-cooler or after-cooler. These coolers reduce the temperature of the air before it enters the engine. 

Modern turbocharged aircraft usually do not need to cool the incoming air. Their turbochargers are generally small and the pressures created are not very high. Thus, the air temperature is not increased very much.

To run a supercharger, it needs to take away some power from the engine. The power it adds is more than the power it uses. A turbocharger is uses the exhaust gases. This is heat energy that would be wasted. 

Turbochargers can be damaged by dirty or poor oil. Most manufacturers recommend more frequent oil changes for turbocharged engines. The turbocharger will heat when running. Many recommend letting the engine idle for several minutes before shutting the engine off. This gives the turbo time to cool down. This will increase the life of the turbo.

The time required for the turbo to build up the needed pressure is called "turbo lag". This is noticed as a hesitation in engine response. This is caused by the time taken for the exhaust system to speed up the turbine. The directly-driven compressor in a supercharger does not have from this problem. 

Lag can be reduced by using lighter parts. This allows the turbine to start faster. Other mechanical changes can reduce turbo lag, but at an increase in cost.

Song Thrush

The Song Thrush ("Turdus philomelos") is a member of the passerine songbird family Turdidae. It breeds across much of Eurasia. It is also known in English dialects as throstle or mavis. The Song Thrush has brown upperparts and black-spotted cream or buff underparts, and has three recognised subspecies. Its distinctive song, which has repeated musical phrases, has frequently been referred to in poetry. 

The Song Thrush breeds in forests, gardens and parks, and is partially migratory with many birds wintering in southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East; it has also been introduced into New Zealand and Australia. Although it is not threatened globally, there have been serious population declines in parts of Europe, probably due to changes in farming practices. 

The Song Thrush builds a neat mud-lined cup nest in a bush or tree and lays four or five dark-spotted blue eggs. It is omnivorous and has the habit of using a favourite stone as an "anvil" on which to smash snails. Like other perching birds (passerines), it is affected by external and internal parasites and is vulnerable to predation by cats and birds of prey.

The female Song Thrush builds a neat cup-shaped nest lined with mud and dry grass in a bush, tree or creeper, or, in the case of the Hebridean subspecies, on the ground. She lays four or five bright glossy blue eggs which are lightly spotted with black or purple. Two or three broods in a year is normal, although only one may be raised in the north of the range.

On average, 54.6% of British juveniles survive the first year of life, and the adult annual survival rate is 62.2%. The typical lifespan is three years, but the maximum recorded age is 10 years 8 months.

The Song Thrush is occasionally a host of parasitic cuckoos, but this is very rare because the thrush usually recognizes the cuckoo's non-mimetic eggs. However, the Song Thrush does not demonstrate the same aggression toward the adult Cuckoo that is shown by the Blackbird. The introduced birds in New Zealand, where the cuckoo does not occur, have, over the past 130 years, retained the ability to recognise and reject non-mimetic eggs.

The Song Thrush is omnivorous, eating a wide range of invertebrates, especially earthworms and snails, as well as soft fruit and berries. Like its relative, the Blackbird, the Song Thrush finds animal prey by sight, has a run-and-stop hunting technique on open ground, and will rummage through leaf-litter seeking potential food items. 

Snails are especially important when drought or hard weather makes it difficult to find other food. The thrush often uses a favourite stone as an "anvil" on which to smash the snail before extracting the soft body and invariably wiping it on the ground before consumption. Young birds initially flick objects and attempt to play with them until they learn to use anvils as tools to smash snails. The nestlings are mainly fed on animal food such as worms, slugs, snails and insect larvae.

Turmeric

Turmeric ("Curcuma longa") is a spice, widely used in Asian cooking. It is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant, in the ginger family, Zingiberaceae.

<br>
Turmeric plants are widely grown in tropical areas of India, where over 70’000 acres are cultivated every year. The plant has long leaves, surrounding spikes where small flowers form. However the root, or ‘rhizome’ of the turmeric plant is harvested, in much the same way as ginger. The turmeric rhizome takes about 10 months to grow before it can be harvested; it is then boiled, cleaned and dried in the sun. Most of the harvested turmeric is ground up and sold in jars for use in cooking, however the fresh root turmeric can also be used. 

<br>

Turmeric is one of the main ingredients of curry powder, and is used to give it the characteristic yellow colour. It is also delicious added to rice dishes, seafood, and mustards and pickles. 
Turmeric is also more widely used as a colourant for textiles and food products. It is sometimes substituted for saffron as it is much less expensive, but produces the same yellow colour. Turmeric has also been used as an alternative to medicine and can be made into a drink to treat colds and stomach complaints.

Peter Bakovic

Peter Bakovic (born January 31, 1965 in Thunder Bay, Ontario) is a retired former professional ice hockey left wing who played briefly in the National Hockey League in the late 1980s for the Vancouver Canucks.

Bakovic played his junior hockey for the Windsor Spitfires of the Ontario Hockey League but was never drafted. After a strong final year of junior, he was signed as a free agent by the Calgary Flames in 1985. A tough player who fought often, Bakovic spent three seasons playing minor pro in the Flames' system without seeing an NHL game. In two years with the Moncton Golden Flames of the AHL, he lead the team in penalty minutes both years, but also posted good offensive totals, notching 54 and 51 points. In his only year with the Salt Lake Golden Eagles, Bakovic posted 43 points in 39 games along with 221 PIM.

Late in the 1987–88 season, he was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks. Vancouver immediately promoted him to their NHL team, and he played 10 games for the Canucks, recording 2 goals and 48 PIM. However, injuries struck the next year and he found himself back in the IHL with the Milwaukee Admirals. Bakovic would play three more seasons in Milwaukee without seeing another NHL game before retiring in 1991.

Following his retirement, Bakovic stayed in Milwaukee and remained with the Admirals organization as an assistant coach until 1998. He continues to reside in Milwaukee and coaches high school hockey.
