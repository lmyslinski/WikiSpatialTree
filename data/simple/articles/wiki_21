Just wondering, I've noticed people creating articles with a section named "External Link" while this is true when there is only one, should we not have "External Links" so a link to that section will always remain valid (even when extra links are added), I'm willing to create a semi automated pywikipedia bot to change these if it is deemed needed. -- 21:51, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

Now an old discussion from last year has been found (), and the decision to use "Other websites" was made. I'm only bringing this up here because as far as I can tell without checking, only one person that was involved in the original discussion is still active here, and because the decision was made a year ago when this wiki was probably a lot smaller than it is now. Before any of us start making more edits to pages that may have to be corrected (again) later, I think we should make the decision here and now what should be used on articles (and maybe make "" that we all so badly need). 17:50, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

I've noticed in that there seems to be a difference in style, we have "Nationality Actors" and "Actors from Country", we even have a double up, and personally I perfer the "Actors from Country" as it is more simple an alternative would be "Actors born in Country" as "Actors from Country" could be thought of as "Actors living in Country". Another one is "Living people" although more tedious to change, "People still alive" might be classed more simple, but rejected due to New changes spam as a result of performing the change. -- 21:51, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

I've noticed in the last couple of days that some bots and some people using are organizing interwiki by alphabetizing the two-letter abbreviation. This confuses me because on both English and Simple English the alpabetizing has always been done according to the word it produces on the "in other languages" section in the margin on the left side of the page. Personally, I agree with the way it's always been done. It's much easier to find the language you are looking for when the listing is alphabetized. In addition to my personal preference, I was made aware of a page that says what the policy is: . Notice that both English and Simple English are listed under "By order of alphabet, based on local language". So my question is, why are these bots and people using AWB changing the agreed-upon consensus? Also, is it okay to change them back or should we have a bot go back and fix changes that were incorrectly made? (If you would like an example of what I am talking about, you can find it ) · 14:27, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

The alphabetization certainly looks good now. Although it is moving <nowiki></nowiki> 3 lines down below the categories (2 blank lines in between). Shouldn't it either be directly above or 2 lines above the categories (with one blank line in between)? That would be my only suggestion for further improvement. Great work! · 01:55, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

I've talked to one of the AWB devs (), and my changes have been incorporated into SVN, so you can either build it your self, or wait until the release (apparently it should be within a few days). -- 23:02, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

This Wikipedia has recently reached 15.000 articles. I think as an effort to put quality first, we should choose articles that we consider very good. There is a template for that, it is called <nowiki></nowiki>. For an article to be very good, it should, in my opinion, meet the following criteria:
In my opinion, we should be able to mark 150 articles (1% of the total number) as very good. I propose this as a project over the next few months; for those that are sick of porting over new content from their favorite wikipedia. Open for flamings, comments, etc. -- 23:13, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

Good idea. Little red riding hood is slightly perfect. It needs one more link. Also, the size of the picture should shrink. 23:56, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

Should the articles in the category very good articles have that tag removed? I like this idea but I was thinking we should start from scratch. Some of those articles have quite a few red links, etc. 
The current "very good articles" have been listed . I encourage anyone who wants to voice their opinion to make comments about whether each page should be kept as a "very good article". Or to suggest ways to improve the article if they think it isn't very good. · 20:14, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

Little Red Riding Hood meets all of User: Eptalon's requirements for a good article. The story may be on the "good article" list. :) 20:04, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

Thats all for now -- 23:37, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

I wondered whether contributors on these pages have any particular criteria in mind when writing Simple English. The Simple English page is, as I understand, addressed to those whose command of English is limited, usually because they are either 1)children or because 2)English is not their Mother Tongue. These two categories of people may have different needs. Let me give an example: some years ago a colleague of mine took some students on a Geography field trip. They were looking at a housing area and, as several of the students were from overseas, she explained in words of mostly one syllable: "These houses were very run down, so they did them up". Blank looks appeared on the overseas student's faces until she reworded it - I think - as follows: "These houses were very dilapidated, so they renovated them". Then they understood! I'm not suggesting writing like that in the Simple Wiki pages, but you can see the problem. Phrases such as "to make do with.." use very simple words, but the combination of them is actually quite difficult. 
I don't know whether I've asked a question or not, but any thoughts might be interesting. 21:11, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

Just created a template which can come in handy.

Hello, when I beefed up Little Red Riding Hood (which is nominated as a very good article), I mentioned the cartoon-style film Tex Avery made about it. In it, Little Red Riding Hood is a dancer in a strip club, and the wolf is a client in that club. I linked to Night club (which we now have twice, and which need to be merged, btw). The problem however is that English does not seem to make a difference between the place young adults (and adolescents) go to have a beer, spend time with their friends, dance, and perhaps start to talk to a nice girl/boy they then (perhaps) spend the night with (aka. disco), and the establishment where frustrated (usually older, male) people go to leer at women undressing; or to enjoy other such shows of the rather explicit type. (aka. "cabaret"; with the problem that cabaret can also be a place where they offer live shows without any sexual connotation, or nudity involved). Both seem to be here as "night club/nightclub". The problem is that in German (and probably other languages, too) there are different words for the two kinds of clubs. What makes it worse is that sometimes, there are live performances, or "shows" in discos. 

Does MediaWiki support more than one iw link per language linked? -- 12:23, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

Since this is a community effort, I feel the community should basically agree. I therefore invite all (named users) to comment, if they feel they agree or disagree. Before this has been done, going further in chosing articles that are very good is pointless. -- 18:28, 23 April 2007 (UTC)

Hi, I can't see the Interwiki options for the different language versions on the Simple English wikipedia or the Main Wikipedia. I can see them if I go "Edit this page", but not on the screen. I have a P4 computer with an up-to-date Internet Explorer browser. Has anyone heard of problems with seeing the Interwiki codes? Thanks 20:20, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

would have to be crenamed the "change this page" tag, to "edit" as in the other wikipeidas and wikiproject, and that.-- | Talk me! or 21:13, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

Since interwiki redirects do not work, I went through all the broken (but sort of working) redirects caused by userpages trying to link directly to other wikis and replaced the redirects with links instead to clean out the pages being constantly listed as broken. This should reduce the clutter on the Broken redirects page with no impact on the users for now. If and when the software is changed to accept automatic interwiki redirect it would be a short process to undo the edits. They can be easily found with a whatlinkshere on the template or its built in category for ease in changing them over should the update ever happen. Most of the pages changed were for users who only created an account, redirected the pages, and then never came back. Very few (Nishkid64) have done more than 10 edits here. -- 05:23, 28 April 2007 (UTC)

Hello community. It is nice that we have a , even with subcategories. I do however think that in the medium term we should get rid of it; names are non-encyclopedic. -- 14:29, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

Instead of writing "external links", "Non-wiki-links" and "not wiki-links" can be written. It is simpler because "not" is a simple word. "External" is not a simple word. 23:26, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

Hamo Beknazarian

Hamo Beknazarian, also known as Hamo Bek Nazarov (born May 19, 1891 in Yerevan, died April 27, 1965 in Moscow) was a Armenian movie director. His career in cinema started in 1914, when a friend offered him a part in a movie. Between 1914 and 1918, he played about 70 parts, becoming a popular actor in pre-Revolutionary Russian film. In 1920, instead of going to Armenia as he planned, he went to Tbilisi, where he developed a film department for Georgian Commissioner's office of Public Education. Many of his movies were filmed in Tbilisi, including "The Father Murderer" and "Lost Treasures". In 1925, he filmed his first Armenian movie and moved to Armenia. In 1933, he made the first Armenian movie to have sound, "Pepo".

Beknazarian also made a few documentary films.

Septuagint

The Septuagint (often referred to "LXX") is a translation of the Hebrew Bible and other books into the Greek language. It was done between the 3rd and 1st century BC in Alexandria. It is the oldest of several translations of the Hebrew Bible into Greek. The Septuagint has all of the books of the Old Testament, and it also has books that Catholics and Orthodox Christians call the Deuterocanon. These books are called Apocrypha by Protestants because they do not think these books are sacred.

An ancient tradition says that 70 Jewish scholars were each in a different room when they translated the Torah from Hebrew into Greek, yet they all wrote down exactly the same text. People thought this was a miracle. The Latin language word for "70" is "septuaginta", and the word "Septuagint" comes from that. Another way to write "70" is "LXX" which is why writers sometimes use that as a short name for Septuagint.

The Septuagint was used as the starting point for some later translations of the Bible.

The World Heavyweight Championship is the top wrestling honor for World Wrestling Entertainment's SmackDown brand. It was created on RAW to match SmackDown's WWE Championship in August 2002. Some of the past champions include Triple H, The Undertaker, Booker T, Batista, and Kurt Angle. 
The World Heavyweight Championship was brought to Raw by then-General Manager Eric Bischoff after WWE Champion Brock Lesnar became exclusive to SmackDown. Bischoff awarded the championship to Triple H, but he had to defend it against his then-best friend, Ric Flair. Triple H was successful and has held the championship on five different occasions. Other holders of this prestigious championship include Shawn Michaels, Undertaker, Rey Mysterio and more.

The current champion is Daniel Bryan who beat then-Champion Big Show (who had just won it from Mark Henry) for the title by using his Money in the Bank contract at pay-per-view event on December 18, 2011. He is in his first reign.

Islamic calendar

The Islamic calendar () is a calendar. It is used to determine islamic holidays. It is a lunar calendar. It has 12 months, and about 354 days. This means that each year, the calendar is about 11 days shorter than a solar calendar, like the Gregorian. Islamic years are often called "hijra" years, because the first year of the calendar when the "hijra" occurred, that is when Muhammad went from Mecca to Medina. Each year is therefore labelled with either "H" or "AH".

Medieval music

Medieval music means music from the Middle Ages. The time we call the Middle Ages is a long period from about 400 AD to 1400 AD. We do not know a great deal about music of this time because it was such a long time ago and music was not often written down. Music was used for entertainment. It was played at feasts and used for dancing. Peddlers (people who went around selling things) shouted or sang to advertise what they were selling. All this music is “secular” (not to do with religion). There was also “sacred” music (music for the church).

In Europe there were people who went around the countryside making a living by singing and playing musical instruments. They often went to big houses where rich people lived and entertained them with their music. These travelling musicians were called minstrels in England, and troubadours or trouvères in many other countries, or Minnesinger in Germany.

The minstrels often sang long songs which told stories (a ballad). This was a way to tell people about what was happening in the world. Some of the stories were made up: they were about love or about mythology.

Richard the Lionheart was a keen musician. He wrote many songs in the style of the trouvères. On the way back from a Crusade he was captured by Leopold of Austria. The story goes that his attendant, Blondel, was looking for him everywhere. Then he heard Richard’s voice singing a tune which he knew and so he found him. The song that he was singing was called "Ja Nuns Hons Pris" ("I am no longer captive").

Minstrels very often went with their masters when they went on journeys to battles. They also sang at important ceremonies, for example when people were being knighted. Many of them played instruments such as the lute or fiddle.

Minstrels were poets and musicians, because they made up their own words and the tunes. Sometimes we know the words of these songs because they wrote them down, but they did not write the tunes down. Walther von der Vogelweide was a famous minnesinger in Germany.

One famous tune that was written down is the round "Sumer is icumen in". It was written down by a monk. Monks could often read and write.

There were two main types of dances in medieval times: line dances and circle dances. The farandole is a line dance. It was a bit like a modern conga with people following a leader in a line. The bransle was a round dance or circle dance. The word “bransle” comes from the French word “branler” (“to sway”). It is pronounced 'Brawl'. 

Other dances were the basse dance and estampie.

Instruments could be divided into quiet ones which were used indoors, and loud ones which were used outside. The recorder was a very popular indoor instrument. There was also the psaltery and the harp (which looked like a small Welsh harp of today).

The bagpipes were loud instruments for outside. They were used for dancing. They were not as loud as modern Scottish bagpipes. They were more like Northumbrian pipes or the French musettes. There was also the hurdy-gurdy which was played by turning a handle. Pipe and tabor were used for Morris dancing.

Many medieval plucked string instruments were similar to the modern guitar, such as the lute and mandolin. The dulcimer and zither were had strings which were hit with sticks. These are still popular in East Europe today. There were also “fiddles” (vielle) and trombones (called sackbut).

It was believed that if you were entertained with music while you are eating it would help you digest your food and help keep your heart healthy. And people believed that you will not get fat even if you scoffed down a load of food. Also eating food while having people dancing for you was believed to have made you fit.

Church music was very important. The mass was the main form of church music. It used the five parts of the mass (the Eucharist service): "Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus" and "Agnus Dei". The priests in the churches wanted church music to be serious. They did not want it to become popular. They thought that if people enjoyed it too much they would forget about worshipping God. Religious plays had become very popular. They told stories from the Bible. However, the church leaders banned them, so they were performed in the streets and squares of the towns.

Instruments were also banned in church. The church leaders thought that they belonged to the devil. Only singing was allowed. Gradually, however, the organ started to be allowed in church. It helped people to sing. Some organs were very tiny. They were called portative organs. The large organs that were fixed in place were called “positives”. Bells were also used in church. They looked like our sleigh bells.

Medieval music was based on plainsong. This was a melody which sounded quite free in rhythm. Composers started adding a second part to the melody as an accompaniment. This was called organum. Sometimes it just simply followed the main tune a fourth or fifth below. This was called “parallel organum”. In the 12th and 13th centuries the original plainsong started to be put at the bottom. It became known as the cantus firmus (the “firm tune”). Sometimes antiphony was used. The simplest form of antiphony is when a leader sings something and a group (the choir) sing something back.

The type of plainchant that evolved was called Gregorian chant. By the 13th century all other types of chant had been forgotten in Western Europe.

Carols became popular at this time. At first a carol was a dancing song, but often these popular songs became used for songs for particular seasons or festivals. In later periods these developed into Christmas carols as we know them.

People often went around in groups, particularly at Christmas, singing at the houses of rich people. This was called Wassailing. The word means “being of good cheer” (i.e. “happy”). "The Boar’s Head" is a well-known medieval carol.

Mummers were groups of people who performed religious plays. They were travelling entertainers. They normally wore masks so that people did not know who they were.

There are not many musical manuscripts which have survived from the Middle Ages. Most of them are religious music. They were often written using a system called neumes. The pitch (music) of the music is shown by the neumes, but the rhythms were not very clear. Gradually the system of writing music we know today was evolving. Philippe de Vitry was an important composer and music theorist. He developed ways of writing rhythms.

Most of the medieval music we know today belongs to the last part of the Middle Ages. There was a tradition known as the “Notre Dame school”. This music dates from around 1150 to 1250. It was the time that great cathedrals were being built in Gothic architecture. The cathedral of Notre Dame was a very famous example. The music of this time was called “Ars antique”. It used a system of rhythms called “rhythmic modes”. Gradually a new way of writing was used. This was called “Ars nova” (“New art”). The most famous composer of this time was Guillaume de Machaut. He developed a kind of composition called the isorhythmic motet. He wrote a lot of songs called chansons (the French word for “song”). Other types of song were called "rondeau", "ballade", and "virelai". 

Composers who were born at the end of the Middle Ages such as John Dunstable, Guillaume Dufay, and Gilles Binchois are often thought to belong to the next period in music history: the Renaissance period.

Neolithic

The neolithic is the youngest part of the Stone Age. The word "neolithic" comes from two words in Greek: "neo", meaning "new" and "lithic", meaning "stone". The neolithic period is the time when farming was invented and when people started caring for animals, such as cows, sheep and pigs. The neolithic starts at different times in different places, since not everyone started farming at the same time. After the neolithic period comes the Bronze Age.

Crotchet

A crotchet or quarter note is a note played for one fourth of a whole note (or "semibreve"). Quarter notes are written as a filled-in oval (or round) note head and a straight, flagless stem (the line). The stem usually points up (like a d) if it is below the middle line of the stave or down (like a p) if it is on or above the middle line.

When beginners start to learn to play an instrument they are often taught that one crotchet lasts for one beat (one count). That is because they are learning pieces with simple time signatures. It is, however, important to remember that other note lengths (minims, dotted crotchets etc) can also be treated as one beat, depending on the time signature.

<doc id="59695" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59695" title="Mayhem (band)">
Mayhem (band)

The Norwegian black metal band Mayhem was founded in 1984 by guitarist Øystein Aarseth (aka Euronymous), bass guitarist Jørn Stubberud (aka Necrobutcher), and drummer Kjetil Manheim (aka Manheim). The band name is taken from the Venom song, "Mayhem with Mercy." 
During the early years, the band used either session vocalists Messiah or Maniac for live/studio commitments, and played either instrumentally, or with Necrobutcher or Euronymous on vocals during rehearsals.

By late 1987 both Manheim and Maniac had left the band, their positions were filled temporarily by members of Vomit, before vocalist Dead, and drummer Hellhammer took over in 1988.

Dead committed suicide in 1991 by shooting himself in the mouth with a shotgun after cutting his wrists with a knife. The shells were given to him by Varg Vikernes (Count Grishnackh), who knew that Dead used to practice with a shotgun in the forest close to the house where the members of Mayhem lived. His body, along with a suicide note saying "Excuse all the blood", was discovered in his room. Euronymous took some pictures (one of them appearing as the cover of the infamous "Dawn of the Black Hearts" bootleg album) of the suicide scene. A legend was born, and it was said that Euronymous had cooked and eaten pieces of Dead's brain. It was also said that fragments of Dead's skull had been collected and made into necklaces that both Euronymous and Hellhammer wore as a tribute to Dead. Of course it is doubtful that the truth was as macabre as people would like to believe regarding the cannibalism, but it is a confirmed fact that necklaces were made, and that pictures were taken.

With the media and police attention following Dead's suicide, Necrobutcher (Jørn Stubberud) decided to leave the band. Dead was replaced by Occultus (Stian Johansen), ex-singer of Thyabhorrent and partner of Euronymous in the "Helvete" shop. He sang and played bass in Mayhem for a few months, but soon left. With the band's need for musicians, Varg Vikernes (Burzum) joined as bassist and even participated in De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas album.

On August 10th, 1993, Varg Vikernes murdered Euronymous in his apartment with Snorre W. Ruch acting as an accomplice. Their relationship before the murder was tense, as their friendship and musical relationship started going downhill. Vikernes, who had started to play bass in Mayhem, killed him due to a number of alleged reasons: over a girl, jealousy of Euronymous's position in the Inner Circle, Euronymous owing him money, Euronymous not releasing Burzum's albums on time. Euronymous was found in his underwear, with stab wounds inflicted with a knife. Varg was rumoured to try and outdo the murder Faust of Emperor committed. At his trial, Vikernes came into court with his long hair made into pigtails, and denying his involvement in Euronymous's death. He giggled and laughed throughout the trial. He was convicted of the murder and was sentenced to 21 years in prison (the maximum possible sentence in Norway). When police arrested Vikernes, he was found with over 150 kilograms of stolen dynamite and alleged plans to destroy Nidarosdomen, a large Christian church in Trondheim, on a religious holiday. Although, Varg Vikernes has a different story to the reasons for killing Euronymous (see www.burzum.org for articles Varg composed himself explaining the murder).

After the trial, Euronymous's parents asked Hellhammer to remove the bass lines that Varg had recorded. He told them he would record new bass lines himself, but the truth is that he didn't know how to play the instrument, so the album remained the same, featuring Varg on it. Other rumours about Occultus playing the new bass lines are also false, he never played a note with the band during his time in Mayhem, according to Hellhammer.

Their gigs featured heavy atmospheric effects such as severed pig heads impaled on wooden spikes. Dead's clothes were buried days/weeks before the show, and were exhumed decayed, soiled, and full of insects. Pieces of rotting meat were thrown into the audience and given to people to devour or rip on the spot. Dead ravens were placed in a bag so Dead could continually smell decay and death. Members were also noted to cut themselves onstage.

Further information can be found in the book "Lords Of Chaos" and the documentary "Once Upon A Time In Norway".

Interesting fact: Euronymous is responsible for getting many nowadays famous bands (Darkthrone, Immortal, Emperor) into black metal and/or influenced them to change their musical style from death metal to black metal. He's considered to be responsible for sparking the whole Norwegian black metal movement and making it what it is today.

Despite once playing in the strongly anti-Christian band Mayhem, early vocalist Kittil Kittilsen (ex-Kvikksølvguttene, Vomit) left the music scene around 2000 and became a fundamentalist Christian and warns people of the dangers of playing in a rock/pop band regardless of what the lyrics/ideology is about.

Shrek

Shrek is an animated movie based upon William Steig's 1990 fairy tale picture book called "Shrek!". It was directed by Andrew Adamson and animated by DreamWorks Animation SKG in May 2001. It was the first movie to win an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, a category introduced in 2001 . It was released on DVD on November 2, 2001. There have also been two sequels (follow-ups) of "Shrek", called "Shrek 2" and "Shrek the Third".

The name "Shrek" likely comes from the Yiddish word "שרעק" (pronounced Shreck) or the German word "Schreck". Both words mean "fear" or "terror".

<doc id="59707" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59707" title="Renaissance music">
Renaissance music

Renaissance music is European music written from about the year 1400 to 1600. This section of time is called the Renaissance, a word which means “rebirth”. The Renaissance comes between the Middle Ages and the Baroque times.

Putting music into time sections does not mean that there were quick changes of type. Music changed slowly. Early Renaissance music was similar to Medieval music. Slowly music-writers started to try new ideas. A lot of medieval church music had become very hard with lots of rules about rhythms and clashes of notes to make dissonances. A lot of Renaissance composers wrote music which was smoother and more gentle. The music was still polyphonic with each voice having a share of melody. Music was starting to become less modal and more tonal. By the time the Baroque period started composers were using a system of major and minor keys like we do today.

In church music composers wrote many masses and motets. The 16th century also saw the birth of the madrigal: secular (not religious) songs which were often about love. The madrigal started in Italy and became very popular for a short while in England from the 1280s. There were lots of other secular songs such as the chanson, canzonetta and villanelle. Songs were often accompanied by a flute.
Music was an essential part of civic, religious, and courtly life in the Renaissance. The rich interchange of ideas in Europe, as well as political, economic, and religious events in the period 1400–1600 led to major changes in styles of composing, methods of disseminating music, new musical genres, and the development of musical instruments. The most important music of the early Renaissance was composed for use by the church—polyphonic (made up of several simultaneous melodies) masses and motets in Latin for important churches and court chapels. By the end of the sixteenth century, however, patronage was split among many areas: the Catholic Church, Protestant churches and courts, wealthy amateurs, and music printing—all were sources of income for composers.

An important development during the Renaissance was music notation. Many musicians wrote books about music theory. They are useful for us because they tell us how music sounded in those days and what people thought about it. Music started to be written on a music stave with five lines. There were still no barlines in early Renaissance music. Notes were written with white note heads, e.g. the minim (half note) was at one time the shortest note that could be written (the “minimum” length). Only later did crochets (quarter notes) and quavers (eighth notes) come in. This does not mean that music was slow in those days, it was just the way it was written.

Key signatures had not yet been invented. Sharps and flats were sometimes shown by accidentals (written in front of the notes). Very often, however, the performers were expected to know or even decide for themselves the sharps and flats (see musica ficta).

Another very important discovery at this time was music printing. Music printing started in Italy in the mid 16th century. It soon spread to other countries. It now became possible for a lot of people to buy music and sing and play it for themselves.

In the early 15th century there was a group of composers known now as the Burgundian School (from Burgundy). Guillaume Dufay was the most famous. Their music sounded a little bit like medieval music. 

Towards the end of the 15th century a style of polyphonic sacred music had been developed that can be heard in the masses of Johannes Ockeghem and Jacob Obrecht. Ockeghem even composed one piece in which all the parts develop from one idea which was used as a canon.

In the 16th century composers started to write music with a clear beat and regular pulse. These included Josquin des Prez and others from the Franco-Flemish School. The was a Roman school, to which the famous Italian Giovanni da Palestrina belonged. His way of writing polyphony has been a model for that style for many centuries. Music students still have to study “Palestrina technique” (how to compose in Palestrina’s style). Although church music at this time is mainly polyphonic it also has homophonic passages where the voices sing the same words together. This helps to make important words really clear.

In Venice, from about 1534 until around 1600, a polychoral style developed. Choirs were separated, singing from different parts of the church, often from galleries. This grand music sounded beautiful in big churches such as the Basilica San Marco di Venezia. These composers are often called the “Venetian School”. Andrea Gabrieli and later his nephew Giovanni Gabrieli wrote this kind of music, and later Claudio Monteverdi who started in the Renaissance and lived into the Baroque period.

The change to the Baroque musical style happened around 1600. This was the time when opera was invented. This needed a new style of composing. The composer Monteverdi wrote in the Renaissance style until about 1600, when he changed to the Baroque style.

<doc id="59743" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59743" title="Musica ficta">
Musica ficta

Musica ficta is a term used in medieval and Renaissance music. It means that when musicians play or sing music they put in accidentals (sharps and flats) which are not written in the music.

In those days (near the end of the 16th century) music used modes instead of the modern system of major and minor keys. Sometimes the music would not sound right unless a note was sharpened or flattened (raised or lowered a semitone). For example, to go down from the note B to an F would have sounded bad, so the F would need to be an F sharp. The composer who wrote the music down might not bother to put the sign for F sharp. He would expect the performer to know that it should be an F sharp and not an F. This is what is called musica ficta.

Gradually it became more and more necessary for composers to write exactly what notes they wanted. The modern system of keys was developing. They developed the system of key signatures and accidentals (sharps and flats which are not in the key signature, but written as and when they are needed). The practice of musica ficta gradually ended.

Gene Simmons (born August 25, 1949 in Haiifa, Israel) is an Israeli-American hard rock bass guitarist and singer for the hard rock band Kiss.
Born with the name of Chaim Witz, in Haiifa, Israel. Gene emigrated at the age of 8 years with his family immigrated to Queens, New York. His mother was born in Jand Flora Klein, Hungary. His father, Feri Witz was also born in Hungary. He adopted the stage name of Gene Simmons in the late 1960's. He lives with long time partner Shannon Tweed and has two kids, Nick and Sophie

in 1972 Gene Simmons together with guitarist Paul Stanley are the band Kiss, Gene and Paul join the band the musicians Ace Frehley on guitar and Peter Criss on drums and vocals. One of the characteristics of the band were his outlandish makeup and costumes. In 1973 Kiss; Paul Stanley guitar and voice, Gene Simmons bass and voice, Ace Frehley in lead guitar released their first album Kiss", Gene composed the hit "Strutter" with Stanley, and "Deuce" two of the biggest hits of the band. Kiss recorded their second album Hotter Than Hell, released in October 22, 1974. In 1975 the band released the third album Dressed to Kill, with the theme Rock and Roll All Nite, the most successful of the band, written by Simmons and Stanley. Gene with Kiss, recorded with two of the best live albums "Alive!" (1975) and "Alive II" (1977). In 1976 and 1977 he edited two of the best albums of the band "Destroyer" released in March 15, 1976, and "Love Gun" released in June 30, 1977. Gene Simmons as the other members of Kiss released the solo album "Gene Simmons" released for sale in 1978. In 1979 he recorded with Kiss "Dynasty" a disc-themed disco. After the album Unmasked (1980), Peter Criss left the band, Gene and Paul chose Eric Carr replaced Criss, in the drummer. In 1982 he joined the band the guitarist Vinnie Vincent in substitution for Ace Frehley. With the newly formed launch the album "Creatures of the Night", Gene Simmons composed the theme "I Love It Loud" one of the most powerful of Kiss. In 1983 Kiss appears without makeup on the cover of the album Lick It Up, the band had changed their style of Hard Rock for the Heavy Metal style. For 1984 released the album Animalize, another powerful album of Heavy Metal. Mark St. John as lead guitarist, was incorporated in replacing Vinnie Vincent. Mark left the band in 1985 and was replaced by Bruce Kulick, who would maintain the lead guitar until 1997. In 1989 Gene recorded with Kiss one of their best album Hot in the Shade, with two of the best tracks from the band "Hide Your Heart" and Forever. In 1991 the premature death of Eric Carr forced to Gene and Paul to seek replacements, They chose a young drummer Eric Singer, who had worked with Alice Cooper. With Singer on drums the band released the album "Revenge" released in May 19, 1992, an album that recalled the band's early records. They also recorded the third live album Alive III (1993).

Question mark

The question mark is a punctuation mark that is used at the end of a sentence when asking a question.

The symbol is thought to come from the Latin quæstio, meaning "question", which was shortened to Qo. The uppercase Q was written above the lowercase o, and this mark was turned into the symbol that we use today.

Another guess about where question mark comes from says that it comes from the 9th century, when it was a point followed by the curved part written slanted.

Some writers put a space between the end of their sentence and the question mark. This is thought to come from a French practice and is called French spacing. In French a space is always put before question marks, exclamation marks, colons, and semicolons. In English, however, using this space is thought of as bad form. The "Oxford English Dictionary" does not encourage it. Some English books do have these spaces, but are often a very thin space, which are not full spaces but an attempt to make the words easier to read.

In computing, the question mark character is represented by ASCII code 63, and is located at Unicode code-point U+003F. The full-width (double-byte) equivalent, ？, is located at Unicode code point U+FF1F.

Electrical circuit

An electrical circuit is a path which electrons from a voltage or current source follow. Electric current flows in a closed path called an electric circuit. The point where those electrons enter an electrical circuit is called the "source" of electrons. The point where the electrons leave an electrical circuit is called the "return" or "earth ground". The exit point is called the "return" because electrons always end up at the source when they complete the path of an electrical circuit. The part of an electrical circuit that is between the electrons' starting point and the point where they return to the source is called an electrical circuit's "load".

Electrical circuits usually use alternating current sources. The load of an electrical circuit may be as simple as the wiring for a house, with outlet boxes to which electrical appliances like refrigerators, televisions, or microwave ovens can be connected as loads. But the loads for electrical circuits can also be quite complicated, such as the load upon the output of a hydroelectric power generating station.

Electronic circuits usually use low voltage direct current sources. The load of an electronic circuit may be as simple as a few resistors, capacitors, and a lamp, all connected together to create the flash in a digital camera. Or an electronic circuit can be complicated, connecting thousands of resistors, capacitors, and transistors to create the microprocessors that make computers possible.

Electrical and electronic circuits can be complicated. Making a drawing of the connections to all the component parts in the circuit's load makes it easier to understand how circuit components are connected. Drawings for electronic circuits are called "circuit diagrams". Drawings for electrical circuits are called "wiring diagrams". Circuit diagrams and wiring diagrams are usually drawn by skilled draftsmen, and then printed. But they can also be simple pencil sketches drawn by technicians or other workers.

Wiring and circuit diagrams use special symbols recognized by everyone who uses the drawings. The symbols on the drawings show how components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, motors, outlet boxes, lights, switches, and other electrical and electronic components are connected together. The diagrams are a big help when workers try to find out why a circuit does not work correctly.

The current flowing in an electrical or electronic circuit can be suddenly increased when a component part fails. The increase in current can cause serious damage to other components in the circuit. Or the failure can create a fire hazard. To protect the other components, or to prevent a fire hazard, a device called a "circuit breaker" can be wired into a circuit. The circuit breaker will open, or "break", the circuit in which it is installed when the current in that circuit becomes too high.

The standard return for electrical and electronic circuits is the earth ground. When an improperly designed electrical or electronic device fails, it may open the return circuit to the earth ground. The user of the device could become a part of the device's electrical circuit by providing a return path for the electrons through the user's body instead of the circuit's earth ground. When the user's body becomes part of an electrical circuit, the user can be seriously shocked, or even killed by electrocution.

To prevent the danger of electrical shock and the possibility of electrocution, ground fault interrupt devices detect open circuits to earth ground in attached electrical or electronic devices. When an open circuit to earth ground is detected, the GFI device immediately opens the voltage source to the device. GFI devices are similar to circuit breakers, but are designed to protect humans rather than circuit components.

20th century classical music

20th century classical music is classical music written during the last century. During earlier periods of music history composers from different countries wrote in styles which were often quite similar. For example, composers in the Classical music period (about 1740-1820) had fairly similar ideas about what forms to use (e.g. sonata form), what instruments should be used in orchestras or how to write good tunes.

Classical music from the 20th century is extremely varied. There are lots of different “schools” (meaning: ways of thinking) as lots of composers had their own ideas about how to compose in ways that were different from what had been done before. A lot of these genres (types of music) had names ending in “ism”: there was serialism, Expressionism, Neoclassicism, Impressionism as well as jazz, world music (music from non-European cultures) and folksong and, later on electronic music and then Minimalism and even post-modernism.

The names of periods in history were usually given to them many years afterwards. For example, the term Middle Ages was not used until long after the Middle Ages had finished. It is difficult to know what to call the period we live in now. In music people often talk about “Modern Music” meaning any music written after 1900. We also talk about “Contemporary Music” meaning more or less the same thing (“contemporary” means “things that are happening in our time”, i.e. “living composers”). Now that the 21st century has started some musicians are starting to talk about “20th century music” (1900-2000) and a period called “Contemporary Music” (1975-today).

This article will discuss classical music written from 1900 to the present day.

Many European composers at the beginning of the 20th century felt that the system of tonality (music in major and minor keys) had been used for so long that it was time to do create a new approach and try something different. Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky were two of the most important composers at that time, and they had very different ideas about how to compose music. 

Schoenberg’s music became very atonal (not in any key). Eventually he developed what he called twelve tone music. This was atonal music which was organized by putting the notes of a musical idea in a particular order which could be changed in many ways during the piece. This way of organizing music is called “serialism” (a “series” is a “row of things”). Many composers were influenced by Schoenberg, especially Alban Berg and Anton von Webern.

Stravinsky came from Russia. He was inspired by Russian culture. He wrote some music for a ballet called Rite of Spring. This music was very new. It had very irregular rhythms which the dancers found very difficult to dance to at first. It also used polytonality (being in more than one key at once). Later on Stravinsky was inspired by music from the 18th century. He used it, but made changes to it, adding dissonant notes and strange chords. This is called neoclassicism (“neo” means “new”). Stravinsky’s music seemed to many people to be the opposite of serialism, but in his last years Stravinsky started to use serialism as well.

In France a movement called Impressionism was popular with painters. Composers were very interested in these paintings. Claude Debussy wrote music which is often called “Impressionistic”. The ideas of clear tonality (being clear about which key the music is in) are often deliberately blurred. He uses interesting chords just for the sound that they make. He used the whole tone scale and pentatonic scale and was inspired by Javanese music. Maurice Ravel’s music is sometimes similar, although he developed his own style. Later French composers include Olivier Messiaen who used a system of new scales which he called Modes of limited transposition. He was also interested in music from around the world, and he also used bird song in his music.

While all this was happening there were some composers who continued to write in a style which was basically Romantic. Edward Elgar ‘s music is often described as “Edwardian” (from the period of King Edward VII). Other British composers of the time were also inspired by English folkmusic, i.e. Ralph Vaughan Williams, George Butterworth, Roger Quilter and Gerald Finzi. Frederick Delius wrote Romantic music which was also quite Impressionistic. The Russian Sergei Rachmaninoff and the German Richard Strauss continued to write in a Romantic style until their deaths in the 1940s. The Finnish composer Jean Sibelius and the Dane Carl Nielsen wrote great symphonies which were still in a tonal style, and in Italy Puccini was writing operas in a Romantic style, often called “verismo” (“like real life”).

In Russia, which became the Soviet Union after the 1917 Revolution, composers were not allowed to be experimental. It was difficult for them because they had to please the politicians who told them that their music should reflect “Socialist realism” (meaning the workers’ struggle against capitalism). The great tradition of writing symphonies continued with Sergei Prokofiev (who spent some time in exile) and Shostakovich (who remained in the Soviet Union).

The Hungarian composer Béla Bartók developed a modern style influenced by folk music from his country and other East European countries. His music is often quite neoclassical, for example the famous "Concerto for Orchestra".

In the mid-20th century a group of composers known as the “Darmstadt School” (because they often met in Darmstadt) continued to write music which was based on serialism. This included Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Many of them, including both Boulez and Stockhausen, also experimented with electronic music. The term Avant Garde is often used to describe their music. It means: music that is new and modern (“in front of the guard”).

In America jazz was a big influence on classical composers. George Gershwin’s music is half way between jazz and classical. Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein used jazz elements in their music. In Europe many composer used ideas from jazz, e.g. Maurice Ravel and Kurt Weill. Other American composers were more modern and experimental, e.g. Charles Ives and John Cage who is famous for using a “prepared piano” (a piano which makes strange sounds because strange objects are put inside it).

Around the 1960s some composers thought that a lot of music was getting too complicated. Music of the avant garde school such as Edgard Varèse, Elliott Carter, Milton Babbitt was becoming too difficult for people to understand. People found it too mathematical and intellectual. They wanted music with feeling and emotion. A group of composers developed a style called Minimalism which uses music based around a simple idea which repeats itself again and again but gradually changes. Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Terry Riley, John Cage and to some extent John Adams all used minimalist techniques. It was a reaction against music that had become too complicated.

While all these different schools of thought were coming and going there were still some composers who managed to keep to a more traditional path and find new ways to use tonality in their music. The greatest figure in British music was Benjamin Britten who was an eclectic composer (i.e. he took ideas from many different people). Two other great composers were Michael Tippett and William Walton, who each developed their own style. In America there were composers such as Samuel Barber, Roy Harris and Alan Hovhaness. In Germany Paul Hindemith was one of the most important composers. Like Kurt Weill, he often wrote music which had a political purpose, but Weill’s music is more jazz-inspired.

Some contemporary composers (alive today) write music which is deeply religious. These include John Tavener and Arvo Pärt. John Rutter and Bob Chilcott, who write music for choirs which sounds fresh and attractive to new audiences. Other composers have found various ways of creating their own style, e.g. the Scottish composers James MacMillan and Judith Weir and the Master of the Queen's Music: Sir Peter Maxwell Davies. In Russia Sofia Gubaidulina and Galina Ustvolskaya are important voices in the search for new music.

Dynamics (music)

In music, dynamics means how loud or quiet the music is.

In written music the dynamics are shown by letters which stand for Italian words for the dynamic levels. They are listed in the table below. Notice that “piano” is pronounced the Italian way (“pi-AH-no”).
"

Use more than two ps or fs to show that the music is very, very quiet, or very, very loud. Tchaikovsky sometimes used five ps or fs, though only up to three are normally found in sheet music.

Dynamic levels are not something that can be measured Exactly. Exactly how loud mp should be depends on several things: what is happening in the music, the instrument, the size of the room in which the music is being played etc. The important thing is that dynamic levels should be correct in relation to one another.

Some composers are very precise about writing the dynamics they want. Others leave a lot to the performer to decide. Historically, composers several centuries ago, such as Bach, only wrote occasional dynamic marks. Even Mozart only wrote a few, mostly p and f. By the 19th century composers were writing dynamics in much more detail in their music.
Sometimes accents are shown by marks similar to dynamic marks. "Sforzando" means a strong, sudden accent and is abbreviated as sf, sfz or fz. The notation fp (or sfp) means a "sforzando" followed immediately by "piano".

The terms "crescendo", and "diminuendo" (or sometimes "decrescendo"), mean a gradual getting louder or softer. They can also be shown by signs known as "hairpins". A hairpin opening out is a "crescendo", one which closes is a "diminuendo".

For a quick change in dynamics, molto cresc. and molto dim. are often used ("molto" means "a lot"). For slow changes poco a poco cresc. and poco a poco dim. are used ("poco a poco" means "little by little", i.e. very gradually.)

Grana Padano cheese

Grana Padano is a kind of hard cheese. It is a kind of parmesan cheese. The name comes from the noun "grana" (‘grain’), which refers to the distinctively grainy texture of the cheese, and the adjective "Padano", which refers to the river Po.

Grana Padano was created by the Cistercian monks of Chiaravalle. They used ripened cheese as a way of preserving extra milk. By the year 1477, it was regarded as one of the most famous cheeses of Italy. Today, this product is made in the regions of Piedmont, Lombardy and Veneto, and in the province of Trento.

Like Parmigiano Reggiano, Grana Padano is a semi-fat hard cheese which is cooked and ripened slowly (for up to 18 months). It is produced by curdling the milk of grass-fed cows. The cows are milked twice a day, the milk is left to stand, and then partially creamed. It is produced all year round and the quality can vary seasonally as well as by year.
A wheel of Grana Padano is cylindrical, with slightly convex or almost straight sides and flat faces. It measures 35 to 45 cm in diameter, and 15 to 18 cm in height. It weighs 24 to 40 kg. The rind, which is thin, is white or straw yellow. 

Grana Padano cheese has been produced since the 12th century, and production and quality are now overseen by the Consorzio per la Tutela del Formaggio Grana Padano.

North American Free Trade Agreement

The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a trade agreement between Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The agreement was signed by U.S. President George H.W. Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and Mexican President Carlos Salinas on December 17, 1992 in San Antonio, Texas, and took effect on January 1, 1994. It removed taxes on products traded between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It also protects copyright, patents, and trademarks between those three countries. It was updated with the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, which helped set more environment regulations and helped reduce pollution. It was also updated with the North American Agreement for Labor Cooperation, which helped people fight for better labor conditions.

Since it took away taxes between products traded between the US, Canada, and Mexico, Mexico has been buying more products from the US. It saved U.S. companies on the cost of selling stuff to Mexico, and it saved Mexican companies on the cost of buying things from U.S. companies. 

A benefit of the bill is that labels on stuff exchanged between the three countries come in French, English, and Spanish. That way, Mexicans and Americans who speak Spanish can read the Spanish label, Americans and Canadians can read the English label, and Canadians who speak French can read the French label.

NAFTA also encourages more immigration from Mexico to the US. Since small businesses can no longer be protected by tariffs, many small business owners in Mexico cannot compete with the prices of subsidized products from the US and therefore many of them have gone under. As a result, many Mexicans have gone to the US looking for work. The human rights organization EZLN (Ejército Zapatista de la Liberación Nacional), a revolutionary Mexican grass roots movement, is a stark opponent of NAFTA and points out how its provisions only make the economic situation worse for the poorest in Mexico and better for multi-national corporations.

Objectivity (science)

Objectivity in science means that scientific measurement can be tested independent from the individual scientist (the subject) who proposes them. 

To be properly considered objective, the results of measurement must be communicated from person-to-person, and then "demonstrated" for third parties, as an advance in understanding of the objective world. Such demonstrable knowledge would ordinarily confer demonstrable powers of prediction or technological construction.

To avoid the variety in subjective (equivocal) interpretation of quantifying terms such as "green", "hot", "large", "considerable", and "negligible", scientists strive, where possible, to eliminate human senses by use of standartized measuring tools (meter stick, stopwatch, thermometer, etc) and mechanical/electronic measuring instruments (spectrometer, voltmeter, timer, oscilloscope, gravimeter, etc) for performing the actual measuring process, eliminating much of the perceptive variability of individual observers. The results of measurements are expressed on a numerical scale of standard units - so that everybody else understands them the same way. Where data must need be used, the ideal is to use "hard", "objective" criteria for assigning the classifications (see definition), such that different classifiers would produce the same assignments.

<doc id="60008" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60008" title="Single (music)">
Single (music)

In popular music marketing, a single is a record release with only one or two songs. The first song (usually the one given the most promotion, and heard more often in the media) is called an A-side, while any other song on the single is called a B-side.

The pairing of recordings on a single comes from the days of and vinyl records, when discs had two playable sides. Modern compact disc singles may contain more than one version of either the A- or B-side, or sometimes an additional recording by the same performer. B-sides may be selections from an album, or songs not otherwise issued for sale.

Many times the chance to get a new song issued as an A-side creates competition between members of bands, or teams of songwriters. John Lennon and Paul McCartney of the Beatles tried to write better songs than each other, to get more A-sides than the other. George Harrison, also a Beatle, rarely had his songs chosen for singles, but had a hit with "Something" for the band. 

In the days of vinyl singles, for both A- and B-sides were paid equally. Many listeners never played B-sides more than once, and radio focused on A-sides. Many people who made recordings knew this, and used it to earn extra money from sales, or to promote other music they made. Phil Spector sometimes used short by his studio band as B-sides to singles he produced. 

Michael Nesmith of the Monkees wanted his songs to appear on Monkees singles. He would settle for B-sides, if he could not get an A-side. Don Kirshner, who oversaw the band's early music, wanted the B-sides to come from other songwriters who worked for him. Nesmith and Kirshner disagreed, and it caused tension for the Monkees and their company.

Records that include more than two or three songs are usually called EPs (for "extended play"), and may include four or more distinct songs, but not as many as on an album.

Objectivity (journalism)

Objectivity is a significant principle of journalistic professionalism. 

Objectivity may mean "fairness", "disinterestedness", "factuality", and "nonpartisanship". The term has not only a single meaning, because journalists and the public use it in these different ways. In many countries, advocacy journalism is considered as a legitimate sort of professional journalism.

Few journalists would make a claim to total neutrality or impartiality. However, most try to keep distance from their own personal biases in their news work. In "Discovering the News" (1978), sociologist Michael Schudson argues that "the belief in objectivity is a faith in 'facts,' a distrust in 'values,' and a commitment to their segregation." In the United States, an objective story is typically considered to be one that steers a middle path between two poles of political rhetoric. 
Journalism without any bias, as if one just came to Earth from another planet and had no opinions about our behavior or ways is rarely practiced, although some argue it would lead to radical changes in reporting. (See, for example, Noam Chomsky, The Journalist from Mars.)

Forbes magazine listed Rafsanjani in their list of richest people in the world and has written that as the real power behind the Iranian government, he "has more or less run the Islamic Republic for the past 24 years." His wealth has earned him the infamous nickname of "Akbar Shah" in Iran.

He served as President of Iran from 1989 to 1997, losing on the second ballot to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the 2005 election on his attempt for a third term in office. After this, he has tried to use his position in the Expediency Council to denounce President Ahmadinejad's administration. He said he would do some privatizations and change foreign policy. However, President Ahmadinejad has noted Rafsanjani's failure to make a difference between privatization and self takeover of government-owned companies. Ahmadinejad has also commmented on the foreign policies of Rafsanjani's administration which lead to sanctions against Iran in 1995 and 1996.

Currently, one of his sons has been accused of receiving a bribe. Analysts expect that his son will not be put on trial, however. 

He was a cleric who used to charge a few dollars for a sermon before 1979. Following the revolution, he and his cohorts became rich by confiscating agricultural land, real estate and industries belonging to those who fled Iran or were executed and jailed. He is a wanted man for the Mikanos murders of Kurdish leaders outside of Iran and unable to leave Iran for that reason. He knows that the Islamic Republic will fall sooner rather than later and that is why he gambled on Mousavi and Green Movement, in the hope of gaining power and saving the regime. He has nowhere to go, a marked man, who shall receive justice one way or another.

Sharia

Sharia (Arabic: ) is the body of Islamic law. The term means "way" or "path"; it is the legal framework within which the public and some private aspects of life are regulated for those living in a legal system based on Muslim principles of jurisprudence.

Sharia deals with all aspects of day-to-day life, including politics, economics, banking, business law, contract law, sexuality, and social issues. 

There is not a strictly codified uniform set of laws that can be called Sharia. It is more like a system of several laws, based on the Qur'an, Hadith and centuries of debate, interpretation and precedent.

Sharia law is divided into three main sections:
See mu`amalat laws according to 5 major schools of jurisprudence and The Majallah


In accordance with the Qur'an and several hadith, theft is punished by imprisonment or amputation of hands or feet, depending on the number of times it was committed and depending on the item of theft. However, before the punishment is executed two eyewitnesses under oath must say that they saw the person stealing. If these witnesses cannot be produced then the punishment cannot be executed.In addition, there are several conditions related to the theft, stolen items, and circumstances. All of these must be met under the scrutiny of judicial authority.

In accordance with hadith, stoning to death is the penalty for married men and women who commit adultery. In addition, there are several conditions related to the person who commits it that must be met. One of the difficult ones is that the punishment cannot be enforced unless there is a confession of the person, or four male eyewitnesses who each saw, simultaneously, the penis of the man inside the vulva of the woman. All of these must be met under the scrutiny of judicial authority. For unmarried men and women, the punishment prescribed in the Qur'an and hadith is 100 lashes.

There are two festivals that are considered Sunnah.

Rituals associated with these festivals are:

Islamic law does not present a comprehensive list of pure foods and drinks. However, it sanctions:

The prohibition of dead meat is not applicable to fish and locusts. Also hadith literature prohibits beasts having sharp canine teeth, birds having claws and tentacles in their feet, "Jallalah" (animals whose meat carries a stink in it because they feed on filth), tamed donkeys, and any piece cut from a living animal.

In most interpretations of Sharia, conversion by Muslims to other religions, is strictly forbidden and is termed apostasy. Muslim theology equates apostasy to treason, and in most interpretations of sharia, the penalty for apostasy is death.

In many Muslim countries, the accusation of apostasy is even used against non-conventional interpretations of the Quran. The severe persecution of the famous expert in Arabic literature, Prof. Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd, is an example of this. In some countries, Sunni and Shia Muslims often accuse each other of apostasy. The current civil strife in Iraq is explained by many in terms of the extremely harsh religious opposition between Sunnis and Shias in Iraq.

Piano duet

A piano duet is a piece of music written for two people to play at one piano. It is often called Piano 4 hands.

To play piano duets the two players sit with one person on the right (playing the high notes) and the other person on the left (playing the low notes). The person on the right is called “Primo” (“First”) and the person on the left is called “Secondo” (“Second”).

Piano duet music is usually printed with the Secondo part on the left-hand page and the Primo part on the right-hand page. Occasionally it is printed with the two parts underneath one another.

Playing piano duets is great fun and an excellent way to become a better musician. Like all group music making, each player has to learn to listen and adapt to what is going on in the other part. Sometimes one player will have to take away his or her hand quickly so that the other player can play the same note immediately afterwards. Sometimes the players have to cross their hands (secondo’s right hand crosses with primo’s left hand).

A lot of the time the primo’s part may have both hands written in the treble treble clef and the secondo’s part may have both hands written in the bass clef. This can sometimes be confusing at first.

The pedalling is usually done by the secondo player. This is because pedalling is very much about keeping chords going (“sustaining”), and it is the secondo who usually has the chords which give the harmony because these are in the lower part.

There are lots of piano duets available for people to play. Some of these are simple ones written for beginner pianists. Some are written by the great composers.

Some pieces that are really supposed to be played by an orchestra have been arranged for piano duet. In some cases the composer himself made this arrangement. Examples from famous composers include Stravinsky’s "Rite of Spring" which is extremely hard to play, and Maurice Ravel’s suite "Ma Mère l’Oie".

Some very famous piano duets which were originally written in this form include several sonatas by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, several pieces by Franz Schubert including a "Fantasia in f minor", Gabriel Fauré’s "Dolly Suite", Debussy’s "Petite Suite" and Georges Bizet’s "Jeux d’Enfants" (which he also arranged for orchestra).

Some works are written for two people to play together using two pianos. These are usually called piano duos. Examples include Mozart’s Sonata in D major K448, the Sonata op 34 by Johannes Brahms who started to write this first as a piano concerto, then a piano duo, before eventually turning it into a piano quintet, and the Suite op 17 by Rachmaninoff. Most piano duos are very hard to play and need very good pianists. Piano concertos can be played on two pianos, with one player playing the solo part and the other playing the orchestra’s music.

There is also a small repertoire of pieces for three people to play at one piano. This is called Piano six hands. These pieces are often fun pieces which are not too hard to play, although there are examples of serious pieces - see the separate wiki article. The three people need to be good friends, because it is a bit of a squash. The player at the bottom ought to do the pedalling but it may be easier for the middle player to do it.

Piano six hands

Music described as piano six hands is for three pianists at one piano, as distinct from piano duet which is music for two pianists at one piano, and from piano trio which is music for piano, violin and cello. Not much music has been written for this combination, although there are several arrangements of music originally written for other forces.

Compositions include 5 pieces by Percy Grainger, Sergei Rachmaninoff's Romance and Valse, Alfred Schnittke's Hommage, Carl Czerny's op.17 and 741, Jean Cras's "Âmes d’enfants", Paul Robinson (composer)'s "Pensees" and "Monmartre", various pieces by German composer Armin Fuchs, Bulgarian composer Tomislav Baynov's "Metrorhythmia 1" , John Pitts's "Are You Going?", Greek composer Dionysis Boukouvalas's "Fantasy on a theme by Steve Reich" and Canadian composer Paul Frehner's "Slowdown."

Rice wine

Rice wine is a word some people use to talk about alcoholic drinks. The word is badly chosen, though. True wine is made by fermenting grapes, and perhaps other fruit. In rice wine, the starch in the rice is first changed into sugar. This sugar is then fermented. This process is more like the fermentation as it is done in beer. 

The "rice wines" made in this manner have more alcohol in them than normal wines (18–25% alcohol compared to 10–14% for normal wines). Beers on the other hand usually have 4–8% alcohol in them.

Many people use the term "rice wine" to refer to sake (which is just one variant of many different kinds of rice wines).

Alcopop

Alcopops are alcoholic drinks. They are also known as Ready-to-drink (RTD), Flavored Alcoholic Beverage (FAB) or Flavored Malt Beverage (FMB). They are usually available in bottles or cans. They contain about the same amount of alcohol as a beer. Usually, they are very sweet, so that the alcohol can not be tasted. 

There are two different kinds of this drinks. In Europe, they are usually spirits mixed with lemonade, like vodka with lemon juice (and a lot of sugar, so the alcohol cannot be tasted), or rum with fruit juice (also very sweet). In the US, they tend to be beers, which taste very sweet.

Because they are very sweet, alcopops tend to be more popular among young people. Since the fact that they contain alcohol is usually not obvious from the taste, these drinks are considered to be dangerous for young people by many countries. These have either raised the taxes on the drinks, or they have outlawed the sale of these drinks to people under a certain age (usually 18, sometimes 21 years).

<doc id="60096" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60096" title="Pedalling (music)">
Pedalling (music)

Pedalling in music means the art of using the pedals on musical instruments.

There are several musical instruments which have pedals for various reasons.

The piano has at least two pedals, large concert grand pianos always have three. The pedal on the right (operated by the player's right foot) makes the sound sustain (carry on). This is because it makes the dampers come off the strings. When the player plays some notes the strings that are hit by the hammers carry on vibrating until the player takes his or her foot off the pedal. Some of the other strings even start to vibrate as well ("in sympathy").

The pedal on the left makes the sound quieter. It is called the "una corda" pedal (literally: "one string"). This is because, in the early days of the piano, the una corda pedal made all the hammers move up so that a hammer would only hit one string for each note instead of three (most notes on a piano each have three strings to make a bigger sound). On modern pianos the hammers actually hit two strings instead of three. They also tend to hit the string at a point where the hammer is softer, away from the little grooves that get worn in the hammer-head. On an upright piano the hammers move closer to the strings so that they do not hit them so hard.

On pianos which have a middle pedal (called a sostenuto pedal) any note or chord that the player is holding down will be sustained, but any more notes he plays afterwards will not be affected. This can be nice in some modern music where a chord can be held while other notes can be played very short (staccato).

On pipe organs there is a pedalboard with pedals which play notes in the same way that the fingers are playing notes. An organ pedalboard usually has two and a half octaves of notes. These are low notes written in the bass clef. An organist has to learn to play with the feet at the same time as with the hands. He uses the toes or the heels of his shoes. It is even possible to play four notes at once (four part chords) but this is very difficult and usually found in some modern French music.

There are seven pedals on a concert harp. Each pedal can be in a high, middle or low position. The strings of the harp can be thought of like the white notes of a piano, tuned to naturals (C,D,E etc). Each pedal will change one of the letter-named notes, e.g. the pedal on the left changes all the Ds to D flat (if the pedal is in the highest position) or D sharp (in the lowest position). From left to right the pedals operate the Ds, Cs, Bs, Es, Fs, Gs and As.

Pedal timpani are timpani with a pedal which will tighten or loosen the drumhead. This will make the note go up or down in pitch. It is a fairly new invention. Composers in the Classical music period never had pedal timpani. Their timpani always had to be tuned by hand using the taps around the side. Composers like Béla Bartók wrote for pedal timpani.

Modern harpsichords often have pedals which change the sound in the same way that stops on an organ change the sound. In earlier harpsichords the sound was more often changed by pushing in or pulling out hand stops.

Alcoholism

Alcoholism is the medical condition of people who often drink too much alcohol. Some people who suffer from alcoholism feel that they have to drink alcohol, even when it causes health and social problems. Alcoholism means addiction to alcohol. People who suffer from it are called "alcoholics". As the condition goes on, those who suffer from it change their habits: obtaining alcohol and consuming it becomes more important. Very often, other interests disappear. Many alcoholics do not think they have a problem with drinking alcohol. With time, they better support bigger quantities, and their personality changes. 

Generally, there are different stages to alcoholism.

The overuse of alcohol has different causes, and there are different forms of treatment available. Some of these treatments are:

Sprain

A sprain is a type of injury in which a person hurts the part really bad, but it is not broken. It has common side affects of a broken bone, but it is less serious.

The first degree is only a minor tear or stretch of a ligament.

The second degree is a tear of a ligament, which is usually followed by pain or swelling.

The third degree is a complete rupture.

The typical signs and symptoms associated with a sprain are the main signs of inflammation: 

Although any joint can experience a sprain, some of the more common include:

Sprains can best be prevented by proper use of safety equipment (wrist, ankle guards), warm-ups and cool-downs (including stretching), being aware of your surroundings and maintaining strength and flexibility. Physical conditioning is the best way to avoid or lessen the degree of sprains.

Second Sino-Japanese War

The Second Sino-Japanese War (July 7, 1937--September 9, 1945) was a major war fought between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan, both before and during World War II.

The Second Sino-Japanese War refers to the war that began when Japan justified its invasion of China in 1931 by the Manchurian Incident, with more numerous 'incidents' that grew into a full scale war from the Marco-Polo Bridge Incident where Chinese troops attacked Japanese soldiers outside the Chinese city Beijing. Through the bombing of Pearl Harbour by the Japanese this war bacame became part of the larger arena of WW II in 1941 known as the Pacific theatre. The invasion of China was the result of the increased dependency of Japan on raw materials to feed its heavy industry by colonizing more of Asia, and of a rise in the military and in nationalism in general. During the Japanese campaign in China, the KMT (Nationalist Government under Chiang Kai-Shek) and the CCP (Chinese Communist Party under Mao Tse dung), nominally cooperated to resist Japan, but, for the most part, continued to fight amongst each other as well. In 1937, Japan began to occupy China, starting in Beijing, and moving to Nanjing, and the industrial cities to the south. Chiang moved his capital to Chongqing, and began a tactic of "using space to trade for time" and effectively spread the Japanese lines out too thin. Despite heavy losses on both sides, 1940 marks the beginning of the end of the Japanese dominance, and marks the effective halting of Japanese advances. The consequences of this war were great: Japan's inability to quickly and decisively win the war against China heavily compromised her ability to fight the war in the Pacific against the Allied forces, and undoubtly contributed to the eventual loss of the war. In China, the war tended to solidify the popular base of support for the Chinese Communist Party, and hastened the collapse of the Republic under Chiang in 1949.

<doc id="60121" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60121" title="Ligament">
Ligament

In anatomy, the term ligament usually means fibrous tissue that connects bones to other bones.
In this use, a "ligament" is a short band of tough fibrous connective tissue composed mainly of long, stringy collagen fibres. Ligaments connect bones to other bones to form a joint. They do "not" connect muscles to bones; that is the function of tendons. Some ligaments limit the mobility of articulations, or prevent certain movements altogether. 

Ligaments are only slightly elastic; when under tension, they gradually lengthen. This is one reason why dislocated joints must be set as quickly as possible: if the ligaments lengthen too much, then the joint will be weakened. Athletes, gymnasts, dancers, and martial artists perform stretching exercises to lengthen their ligaments, making their joints more supple. 
The consequence of a broken ligament can be instability of the joint. Not all broken ligaments need surgery, but if surgery is needed to stabilise the joint, the broken ligament can be joined.

<doc id="60124" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60124" title="Powiat">
Powiat

A county (Polish: "powiat", pronounced "povyat"; plural, "powiaty") is the Polish second-level unit of administration, equivalent to a county, district or prefecture in other countries. A county is part of a larger unit called a "voivodship" (in Polish, "województwo". One would call it in English "province").

Most Polish counties are named after their capital city, or county seat. 
If a county seat has a double-barreled name, as with "Maków Mazowiecki," the county may become either "Maków County" or "Maków-Mazowiecki County." Due, in all but the first case, to the existence, respectively, of two "double-barreled" county seats with the identical noun name, the corresponding adjectives ""bielski"," ""grodziski"," ""ostrowski"" and ""tomaszowski"" each denote "two" distinct counties.

Some Polish urban communes constitute administrative entities called the "urban county" ("powiat grodzki"), similar in local administration and self-governance to "land counties." An average county (the largest being the powiat of Białystok) comprises 5 – 8 communes. The largest urban county, in terms of population and area, is the city of Warsaw. 

The history of Polish counties goes back to the second half of the 14th century. They remained the basic units of territorial organization in Poland, then in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, until the latter's total dismemberment by its neighbors in 1795. 

In the 19th century, the county continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire ("Congress Poland"), and as the Polish equivalent of the German ""Kreis"" in the German-governed Grand Duchy of Poznań. 

After Poland regained independence in 1918, the county again became the basic territorial unit throughout Poland. "Powiat"s (counties) were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodships, but were reintroduced in 1999. There are now 314 "land counties" ("powiat ziemski") and 65 "urban counties" ("powiat grodzki"), more formally "municipalities with county status" ("miasto na prawach powiatu").

Oba Chandler

Oba Chandler (October 11, 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio - November 15, 2011 in Raiford, Florida) was an American convicted murderer who was executed in Florida for the murders of an Ohio woman and her two teenage daughters. The women's bodies where found floating in the Tampa Bay, Tampa in June 1989. The women had been bound and gagged and then tossed into the bay with concrete blocks tied to their necks while still alive. 

Billboards where at the later stages of the investigation used in trying to find however did the murders, the billboards that was spread all over Tampa had pictures of the Rogers women and a picture of the hand-writing of the thought triple murderer. This method had never been used before, and became useful in searches for missing people later on. 

Chandler was not arrested until September, 1992. He was put on trial where he was found guilty of the murders by a 12 member jury. In November 4, 1994 he was sentenced to death by a deadly by the judge in the case. Chandler is right now at Union Correctional Institution in Florida. Author Thomas French in 1998 won the Pulitzer prize for his article series Angels & Demons which told the story of the murders.

Oba Chandler was born in Cincinnati the state of Ohio. He was the fourth child in a family of five children. His parents were Oba Chandler Sr. and Margaret Johnson. At the age of 10, Chandlers' father Oba Chandler Senior hanged himself in the Chandler family's basement. This upset Oba so much that he jumped into his father's grave during the funeral in 1957 while gravediggers were covering the coffin with dirt. Afterwards, Oba's life spun out of control and he was arrested many times and had been arrested 20 times by the time he was a teenager. As an adult, he was charged with a long list of crimes, like having fake money, burglary, kidnapping and armed robbery. Chandler would also father a total of eight children before his arrest, the latest one being Whitney born in February, 1989 with his wife at the time Debra Chandler. Between May and September of 1991 Chandler worked as an informant for the US customs Tampa office, at the same time as Tampa police investigated the Rogers family triple murder.

Joan Rogers and her two daughters, Michelle (17 years of age) and Christe (14 years of age) left their family dairy farm on May 26, 1989 in Willshire for a vacation in Florida.

The women's bodies were discovered floating in the Tampa Bay on June 4, 1989 with bound hands and feet with concrete blocks tied to their necks and duct tape over their mouths. The first body was found floating over the Sunshine Skyway bridge when a sailboat on its way home to Tampa after a trip to Key West, had just crossed under the Sunshine Skyway when many people on board saw an object in the water. They soon realized it was a dead body of a female. Soon another body was found and yet another third body was also dragged out of the bay within an hour. All three bodies had been tied and gagged and had concrete blocks tied around their necks. Autopsies thought the women had been tossed into the bay while still alive.

The Rogers women where identified a week after their bodies where found in the bay. A hotel maid had discovered that a hotel room had stood unused for several days. And when the reports about the murders started to leap into the media the hotel decided to contact investigators in the case. Soon it stood clear that it was indeed the families room after fingerprints where matched to those of the victims, some snaphots from a camera was also discovered in the room which showed where the family had traveled and also a last shot over Tampa Bay. This photo was taken just minutes before the Rogers women went out to meet Oba Chandler to go on a boat ride out on the bay.

The case remained unsolved and cold for several years, partly due to the volume of tips pouring in to the police who investigated the crime.
Chandler would not be arrested for the murders until September 24, 1992. His handwritten directions and palmprint on a brochure found in the Rogers' vehicle, along with a description of his boat written by Jo Rogers on the brochure, were the primary clues that led to his being named a suspect. Also, authorities had posted the handwriting from the brochure on billboards, which was historic as it was used for the first time in an attempt to find the unknown killer, and this led to a tip from a former neighbor who was able to provide a copy of a work order that Chandler had written. A handwriting analysis conclusively matched the two.

The Rogers women were all buried on June 13, 1989 after a funeral service at the Zion Lutheral Church in their hometown of Willshire, Ohio. About 300 people among them family and friends of the victims attended the service. Numerous police officers were also present to keep all news media and crews out of the church during the funeral service, this because of the huge media interest for the case by media at the time. Chandler was tried and found guilty of the murders, and sentenced to death on November 4, 1994. After sentencing, the jury forewoman commented regarding the death sentence that ""They need to do this swiftly. The man is a mutation of a human being and he needs to be destroyed."" In July 2008, it was revealed that Chandler was on Florida's short-list of executions. 

Profiling experts believe that Chandler may have killed previously, based on the speculation that a first-time killer would not be experienced or bold enough to abduct and kill three woman at once. Chandler remains a suspect in a 1982 murder of a woman found floating off Anna Maria Island, he is also a suspect in a rape case concerning a Canadian women weeks before the Rogers women's murder. However, Chandler has never been charged with other murders. Chandler got an Institutional Adjustment disciplinary report on December 15, 2001, for disobeying orders in prison. All of Chandler's appeals since his 1994 conviction have been denied, the latest one in May 2007. Author Thomas French in 1998 won the Pulitzer prize for his article series Angels & Demons which told the story of the murders.

Oba Chandler was executed on November 15, 2011 with an lethal injection at 4.25 pm in Florida State Prison in Raiford, Florida.

All Saints Day

All Saints Day is celebrated by Catholic Christians on November 1. `Other Christian faiths celebrate it as well. (May not be on the same day) It is a mandatory Catholic holiday. It is celebrated in the catholic church.
The next day, November 2 is celebrated as All Souls Day, souls in Purgatory are especially remembered. Both days are considered important and they are integrated with each other. 
All Hallows or Hallowmas 

All Saints is also a Christian formula involving all the faithful saints and martyrs, known and unknown.

In Portugal, Spain and Mexico, "ofrendas" (offerings) are made on this day. In Spain, the play "Don Juan Tenorio" is traditionally performed. In Spain, Portugal, Italy and France, people bring flowers to the graves of dead relatives. In Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia, Lithuania, Croatia, Austria and Germany, the tradition is to light candles and visit the graves of deceased relatives. In the Philippines, the day is spent visiting the graves of deceased relatives, where they offer prayers, lay flowers, and light candles, often in a picnic-like atmosphere. In English speaking countries, the festival is traditionally celebrated with the hymn "For All the Saints" by William Walsham How. The most familiar tune for this hymn is "Sine Nomine" by Ralph Vaughan Williams. 

The festival was retained after the Reformation in the calendar of the Church of England and in many Lutheran churches.

Origami

Origami is a traditional Japanese art of paper folding. It uses many techniques and various objects can be created. The object is made of origami paper, which is specially made for folding and staying in shape. Many dictionaries and television shows suggest that origami is only paper cranes, waterbombs, and paper planes. But many new models and creatures have been made because new folding techniques have allowed this. 

When the Japanese first folded origami, they used only one piece of paper. A different kind of origami called "modular origami" uses many small pieces that are the same, which are combined to form one large model. Also, many mathematical shapes can be made with origami.

The beginnings of origami is not clear. Paperfolding started in China in the 1st or 2nd century. It finally came to Japan in the 6th century. Instead of making models that looks exactly like things, the first origami models only looked similar to things. People often folded models and gave them to other people for good luck. For example, Shinto nobles celebrated weddings with sake in glasses decorated with origami butterflies, which gave good luck to the bride and groom. 

There were also independent paperfolding traditions in other countries, like Germany and Spain. The earliest evidence of paperfolding in Europe is a picture of a boat in 1490. There was also a paper box from 1440. Finally, in 1845, "Kan no mado" was written, and it was the first book of origami models. 

Recently, people have become more interested in origami. In 1954, Japanese paperfolder Akira Yoshizawa created rules to explain how to fold origami models. His instructions on paperfolding are now used in all countries.

Peter Engel, who is a well-known paperfolder, says "the best paper [for origami] is thin and crisp and absolutely square." Pre-cut origami paper is sold in many colors, sizes, and patterns. Duo paper, or paper with different colors on each side, is used by paperfolders because it makes areas of different color on the finished model. There are also special papers, like textured, metallic, and patterned.

Many people like to make their own paper. Engel describes a process shown to him by Robert Lang that is "a sandwich of aluminum foil and two pieces of tissue paper." In this method, two pieces of paper are pasted to each side of the aluminum foil. Many people like origami because there is almost always paper. Copy paper, napkins, wallpaper, index cards, and even paper money can be used to make interesting and unique models. 

Many paperfolders prefer to use a flat surface to fold models on, but others, like the Japanese, fold in the air. Traditional paperfolders believe that only the hands should be used when folding, but many modern folders use other tools when folding. Tweezers and paper clips can be used to make very small folds. Some folders use rulers or other flat tools to make sharper creases in the models.

New types of origami have been made because more people are making origami models. 

Pureland origami is origami with one rule: only one fold can be made at a time. British paperfolder John Smith started pureland origami for inexperienced paperfolders or for people with poor motor skills. Hard folds, like the inside-reverse fold, are not allowed in pureland origami.

Statement

Statement has several meanings:


Items two, three and four have something in common. They refer to more than words and sentences. They claim correctness in substance, as in a witness box or a police statement. Item five guarantees accuracy, and item one is merely a synonym for speaking.

In philosophy and logic, a statement is a sentence which declares that something meaningful is either true or false. Here 'sentence' refers to grammar, while 'statement' refers to its content. Statements are therefore abstract, logical things. Statements are similar, or identical, to "propositions". In Aristotelian logic, a proposition is a particular kind of sentence, one which affirms or denies a predicate of a subject. Aristotelian propositions take forms like "All men are mortal" and "Socrates is a man."

Many modern philosophers take the view that 'statement' and 'proposition' are synonyms, or ought to be.

Polyhedron

A polyhedron (one polyhedron, many "polyhedra", or "polyhedrons") is a geometrical shape. It has flat faces, and straight edges. Usually it is defined by the number of faces, or edges. 

Mathematicians do not agree on what makes a polyhedron. 

Usually, polyhedra are named by the number of faces they have. The first polyhedra are the tetrahedron, which is made of four triangles, pentahedron (five faces, can look like a four-sided pyramid), hexahedron (six faces, a cube if it is regular), and heptahedron (seven faces, can look like a prism based on a pentagon, or a pyramid based on a hexagon amongst others).

Calendar date

A Calendar date is a way to refer to a certain day in a calendar. With the calendar date and the calendar, the exact day can be identified. With a different calendar, the same calendar date may refer to a different day. This can be seen easiest when comparing the Julian calendar with the Gregorian calendar. 

Calendar dates are important to refer to events (most holidays are fixed with reference to a particular event or calendar date.) One example may be Easter. In the Middle Ages, it has been fixed that Easter is to be the first Sunday that is (on or after) the 14th day after the spring equinox. 

Most calendar systems have a date format that has three parts, the day of a certain month, the month and the year. Sometimes the week is added.

The Iranian calendar also known as Persian calendar or the Jalāli Calendar is a solar calendar. It is currently used in Iran and Afghanistan. It is observation-based, rather than rule-based. Each year starts on the vernal equinox as precisely determined by astronomical observations from Tehran (or the 52.5°E meridian, which also defines IRST) and Kabul. This makes it more accurate than the Gregorian Calendar.

The current Iranian Calendar year is "'1387 AP" (AP = Anno Persico/Anno Persarum = Persian year)".

Tendon

A tendon (or sinew) is a tough band of tissue that connects muscle to bone. It is built to withstand tension. Tendons are similar to ligaments except that ligaments join one bone to another. Tendons and muscles work together. They can only create a pulling force.

The beginning of a tendon is where it connects to a muscle. Collagen fibers from the inside of the muscle are the same as those of the tendon. A tendon inserts into bone at an enthesis. At this point, the collagen fibers are changed into bone tissue. Tendons can not create any pulling force of their own. The tendons transfer the movement of muscles. They can create an elastic force if stretched.Tendons are part of the human body often connected to joints.

Coffee substitute

"Coffee substitutes" are products that try to taste like coffee. The idea for using them is to have a drink that tastes like coffee, but has no caffeine in it. The main reasons for making coffee substitutes are medical and economic. In World War II, acorns were used to make coffee, however it tasted foul. It was also hard to get. In the American Civil War there was a similar story -

""For the stimulating property to which both tea and coffee owe their chief value, there is unfortunately no substitute; the best we can do is to dilute the little stocks which still remain, and cheat the palate, if we cannot deceive the nerves."" The Southern Banner, 1865]

Grain coffee and other substitutes can be made by roasting or decocting various organic substances.

Some ingredients used include: almond, acorn, asparagus, barley and malt, beech nut, beetroot, carrot, chicory root, corn, cotton seed, dandelion root, fig, boiled-down molasses, okra seed, pea, persimmon seed, potato peel, rye, sassafras nut, sweet potato.

Chicory has been sold commercially on a large scale since around 1970, and it has become a mainstream product. It was widely used during the American Civil War on both sides.

Postum is an instant type beverage used in place of coffee. It reached the height of its popularity during World War II. For popular usage on the sitcom Seinfeld George says to Jerry he does not know why postum is not a more popular beverage.

Croatian language

The Croatian language is spoken mainly in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina throughout the countries, and surrounding countries of Europe.
Croatian grammar is grammar of Croatian language. As Croatian language is three-dialectal in its basics (Kaikavian, Chakavian and Shtokavian), here are presented both histories and present states of all three dialects of which consists Croatian language. 

List of Croatian-language grammar books shows that codification of Croatian language in its grammars is rich, and starts from beginning of 17th century (first was grammar of Bartol Kašić in Latin in 1604). From 1604 to 1836 there were 17 grammars, most of them dominantly Štokavian, other Kajkavian. Grammar of Bartol Kašić (17th century) described supradialectal form of Ikavian Štokavian with Čakavian admixture, in 19th century Croatian language already have grammar dominantly based on Štokavian in "Nova ricsoslovnica illiricka" of Šime Starčević (1812) and "Grammatik der illyrischen Sprache" of Ignjat Alojzije Brlić (1833), although it is not formally so. Not only before 19th century Croatian language used three dialects almost equally (Kajkavian, Chakavian and Štokavian) but orthography of same dialect differed on Adriatic coast to that used near Hungarian border, as one was under influence of Italian, other of Hungarian language. 
All grammars of above period (1604-1836) use three accents: acute, grave and circumflex, Starčević's grammar is exception as it uses system of four accents.
In 19th century Ljudevit Gaj proposed new letters from Czech (č,ž,š,ľ,ň,ď and ǧ), accepted were letters č, ž and š, from Polish ć, for other phonems accepted were digraphs ie, lj, nj and dž, later dj or gj was changed to đ (according to proposal by Đuro Daničić).

Croatian language uses Latin script of 30 letters and one diphthong "ie" or "ije", and "ŕ", such system is in Croatian called "gajica" (or croatian Gaj's Latin alphabet), name came from Ljudevit Gaj. Letter order (and whole alphabet) is in Croatian called "abeceda", as first 4 letters are spelled "a, be, ce, de". For writing foreign names and words, also in some professions Croatian language uses letters which do not belong to "gajica", like "X, x (iks), Y,y (ipsilon" and others.

Croatian alphabet (Gaica) 1830.c

In Croatian, nouns change form depending on the composition of the sentence. This is called declension. Declension has been proved the most difficult to master for people who are learning Croatian. It is very complicated and time consuming to explain it and because of that we will use simpler techniques in this course. However, many languages have noun and pronoun declension including English. In English, though, only pronoun declension remained through the course of years. Let us start by explaining all of the seven Croatian grammatical cases. The technique that is most frequently used in determining grammatical cases (the same technique is used in Croatian schools when taught to children) is by asking yourself a question when you are trying to figure out which case a noun should be in. In Croatian, grammatical cases are called padeži (plural) and padež (singular). 
The question you will ask yourself here is: “Where is Krešimir going?”. And the answer is that he's going to school. By looking at the table below you will see that the question 'where' is used for the Locative case.
Grammatical case The question you should ask yourself when determining the grammatical case *Example:

Determine the grammatical case of the underlined nouns in the following sentences:

Croatian nouns are divided into three genders. The masculine, feminine and neuter gender. To know a noun's gendre is very important because it affects all the words that are tied to the noun, such as adjectives. Such thing does not exist in English but do not get discouraged. There is a way of telling what gendre a noun is without memorizing it for each and every one. A gendre is determined by the noun's ending (with some exceptions). See the table below. 
It is also vital to know that nouns retain their gender in plural. For instance, the noun 'žene' (women) is of the feminine gender and not neuter which would be easy to think because the word ends with the letter -e. 


Determine the gender of the following nouns:
Krov, dolina, papir, staklo, panj, igra, brak, jaje, hitac, iskra, stablo, ljuljačka, zelje, karton.
Croatian verbs have two grammatical aspects; the perfective and imperfective. The perfective aspect depicts an action that has already been finished or done with. The imperfective aspect depicts an action that is still going or underway. So, each verb in its infinitive form can be written in 2 ways; in its perfective and imperfective aspect. The table below is showing 5 verbs both in their perfective and imperfective aspects.

In Croatian, there are seven grammatical tenses. They can be divided in two ways. By the time they take place in and by their complexity. Simple tenses consist of only 1 word (simple tenses are aorist, imperfect, present) while complex tenses consist of 2 or even 3 words (complex tenses are pluperfect, perfect, first future, second future) because they also consist of auxiliary verbs. Also, some grammatical tenses cannot be formed with both grammatical aspects, they work with only.

Determine the tenses of the underlined verbs:



The Croatian week starts with Monday and ends with Sunday, unlike weeks from some other countries where Sunday is the first day and Saturday the last.

<doc id="60237" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60237" title="Christian Church">
Christian Church

The term Christian Church, Catholic Church or One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, as it was called by 110 AD, refers to the "universal company of believers". It means every person who has ever accepted or ever will accept the Christian Faith. The idea is that all these people together make up one "body" called "the Church". "The Church" (in this sense) is not thought of by Christians as an ordinary human organisation. It is thought of as being part of God's way to bring people close to him. "The Church" was begun by Jesus in the 1st century AD. It is called "The Christian Church" because Jesus was called "The Christ" (or holy one from God). 

"Churches" as Christian organisations were begun by Jesus' followers. Today there are many churches in the sense of "church organisations". The different organised churches are called Christian denominations. 

The main Christian beliefs are held by all major Christian denominations. These beliefs are often said aloud by Christian people in a "statement of faith" which is called the Creed. The Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Lutheran, Anglican Communion and other Protestant churches all believe that God is the "creator and eternal father of all things", that Jesus was the "Christ" and son of God who died to save people from the punishment for their sins, and that the Holy Spirit is God's gift to help and comfort Christian people. Christians believe that these are three parts of One God.

There are many other beliefs that are different between different denominations. These differences have sometimes caused arguments and have caused the organised church to split into denominations. The different opinions are called controversies. 

The English word "church" comes from the Greek κυριακή (kyriake) meaning "Master's (house)", or "Lord's (house)". In modern English the word "church" is used for both a church building and "the Christian Church" throughout the world. 

In 381 AD, at the a meeting of bishops known as the First Council of Constantinople, the Nicene Creed (a statement of beliefs) that was used at the time was changed to include a description of the Church. The words that were added to the Nicene Creed are "One Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church". This important addition describes what the four most important things that Christians were to believe about the Christian Church. 

These are the four words that are used in the Nicene Creed: 

One important controversy is simply the definition of the Christian or Catholic Church. To some degree this controversy comes from the Nicene Creed with its words "One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church" which means "universal" church. Many denominations believe that all denominations are part of a world-wide Christian Church and think that the most important thing is the "common faith" and not a common organisation or tradition. ("Common faith" means "the faith that is the same". The word "common" does not mean "ordinary" in this sense.)

For many hundreds of years, the Roman Catholic Church has regarded itself as the only Christian Church and has called itself the "Catholic" (or "universal") church. In other words, only those people who were within the "organisation" of the Roman Catholic Church were believed to belong to the "Universal Church". In the 20th century this view began to change and in the late 20th century there was a strong movement within parts of the Roman Catholic Church to reach out to other denominations. The Eastern Orthodox Church has thought of itself in the same way, but in the late 20th century there has been much more discussion between the Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican Churches. Some smaller denominations such as Jehovah's Witnesses also believe that they are the one and only true Christian Church.

A religious denomination (also simply denomination) is a subgroup within a religion that has a common name, tradition, and identity.

The term is often used for several Christian denominations (for example, Eastern Orthodoxy, Catholicism, and the many sorts of Protestantism like Baptist, Methodist, Episcopalian and Pentecostal. 

It is also used for the four branches of Judaism (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist), and (less often for the two main branches of Islam (Sunni and Shia).

In Hinduism the major deity or philosophical belief functions as the identifier of a denomination and typically each has distinct cultural and religious practices. The major denominations include Shaivism, Shaktism, Vaishnavism, Smartism, and Halumatha.

<doc id="60240" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60240" title="Christian denomination">
Christian denomination

The word denomination is used for a large group of Christian people right across the world who use the same name, the same sort of organisation and have the same (or very similar) beliefs. Christianity is divided into five main groups. These groups all branched out at different dates from the Early Christian Church founded by the followers of Jesus. The splits generally happened because they could not agree on cetain beliefs or practices. The groups then divided into smaller groups. Each group that has its own separate name is a "denomination". The word "denomination" means "having a name". 
Worldwide Christianity is divided into five major groups of Churches:
Each of these five has important subdivisions. There are also other (smaller) groups that are not mentioned here.

The Protestant branch of Christianity is much more divided up than any of the others. All the many divisions of Protestantism are not shown on the diagram. Each separate Protestant Church is called a "denomination". While the Roman Catholic Church looks to a single earthly leader, the Pope, and has similar beliefs right across the world, the Protestant denominations do not look to a single leader and sometimes have beliefs that are very different from each other. 
Many Christian denomination see themselves as part of the worldwide Church which includes other denominations as well. Some denominations, such as the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches and some Protestant Churches, believe that they are the "only" true Christian church. 

Some denominations have beliefs which almost all the other denominations would disagree with, very strongly. These beliefs are called "heresy" by the other churches. 

There were some movements considered heresies by the early church which do not exist today and are not generally referred to as denominations. Examples include the Gnostics (who had believed in an esoteric dualism), the Ebionites (who venerated Christ's blood relatives), and the Arians. The greatest divisions in Christianity today, however, are between Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, and various denominations formed during and after the Protestant Reformation. There also exists in Protestantism and Orthodoxy various degrees of unity and division.

Comparisons between denominational churches must be approached with caution. For example, in some churches, congregations are part of a larger church organization, while in other groups, each congregation is an independent autonomous organization. This issue is further complicated by the existence of groups of congregations with a common heritage that are officially nondenominational and have no centralized authority or records, but which are identified as denominations by non-adherents. Study of such churches in denominational terms is therefore a more complex proposition.

Numerical comparisons are also problematic. Some groups count membership based on adult believers and baptized children of believers, while others only count adult baptized believers. Others may count membership based on those adult believers who have formally affiliated themselves with the congregation. In addition, there may be political motives of advocates or opponents of a particular group to inflate or deflate membership numbers through propaganda or outright deception.

<doc id="60244" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60244" title="Creed">
Creed

A creed is a statement or confession of belief — usually religious belief — or faith. The word comes from the Latin "credo" for "I believe". It is sometimes called "symbol" (Greek, συμβολον), that means a "token" by which persons of like beliefs might recognize each other.

It is likely that the earliest creed of Christianity that deserves the title in full is the Apostles' Creed. The Apostles' Creed seems to have been formulated to resist Gnosticism; it emphasizes the birth, physical death, and bodily Resurrection of Jesus Christ. It reads:

The Nicene Creed is clearly derived from the Apostles' Creed, and represents an elaboration of its basic themes. The most important additions to this creed are much more elaborate statements concerning Christology and the Trinity. 
Christians today probably use the Nicene Creed most widely, followed by the Apostles Creed.

The Jewish faith recognizes a single creed called the Shmah or Shema Yisrael, a statement of faith in strict unitarian monotheism, the belief in one God. This creed is embodied in a single prayer recited twice a day: "Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One", also translated as "Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is unique ["or" alone]."

In Hebrew: שמע ישראל אדני אלהינו אדני אחד

This is pronounced phonetically in Hebrew: "Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad".

The most basic attempt to put the religion of Islam in a brief statement of doctrine is the shahada, the proclamation that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His prophet. 

More detailed credal declarations of Islamic dogma constitute aqidah.

The six Sunni articles of belief are:

Also from the Aqidah of the Salaf is the belief that the faith (i.e. Eemaan) consists of (both) speech and action and that it increases and decreases. This differs from the Murji’ah a sect who uphold the belief of “Irjaa’”-to hold that sins major and minor, do not affect the faith and that faith neither increases nor decreases. 

And they uphold the belief that the Quran is the Speech of Allah, His Revelation and Light. It is not created, since the Quran is from Allah and that which is from Allah is not created. One of the attributes of Allah is his Speech. Since His attributes have been with Him eternally, His Speech cannot be created and therefore, the Quran is not created. According to the Salaf, debating about it is disbelief. It is not denied except by a Jahmee. A Jahmee is one who denies Allah’s attributes.

أشهد I witness
أن that
لا اله الا الله no other deity is worthy of being worshipped besides Allaah
و أشهد and I witness
أن that 
محمداً Muhammad
عبده is his slave

The Shahada of the Shiia is the same thing, except that they add و علي وليُ اللهِ)) meaning that they bear witness that Ali is Allaah’s representative.
Allaah almighty’s message to all nations is the same message (la ilaha illa Allaah) except for witnessing that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. 
This testimony of faith أشهد أن لا اله الا الله و أشهد أن محمداً عبده و رسوله only occurred after the Prophet Muhammad (Salla Allaahu Alayhi wa sallam) was sent, and before him it was Eissa (Jesus), and the testimony of faith at that time to those people was (Ash-hadu Anna la ilaha illa Allaah wa anna Eissa ibn Maryam abdahu wa rasulahu), and the same thing for Musa’s people (Ash-hadu Anna la ilaha illa Allaah wa anna Musa abdahu wa rasulahu)

Of all the Prophets that were sent only five of them as mentioned in the Quran were Messengers of Allaah sent to every existing creature, and the rest were prophets who were sent only to their people. These five Messengers are (Noah, Musa, Eissa, & Muhammad “Salla Allaahu Alayhi wa sallam”)

As for the followers of Muhammad (Salla Allaahu Alayhi wa sallam) being the last of all nations because of him being the last of all Messengers, and the Quran being the last of all books this puts all creatures who hear of Allaah, and Muhammad (Salla Allaahu Alayhi wa sallam) on the target to embrace Islam. Furthermore, it is important to know that no one may embrace Islam until he makes Shahada, and no one may make Shahada until he believes in (Tawheed Ar-rabubiya, Tawheed Al-Alauhiya, and Tawheed Al-Asmaa’ Wassefat.)
After the person believes in all three sections of the Tawheed with a firm belief he can then witness that there is no other God worthy of being worshipped other than Allaah, and that Muhammad is indeed his final Messenger.

Purgatory

According to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, Purgatory is the "final purification of the elect": "All who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven." 
“ In Purgatory there are different levels ; the lowest is close to hell and the highest gradually draws near to Heaven. It is not All Souls Day, but, Christmas, that the greatest number of souls leave Purgatory.

There are in Purgatory, souls who pray ardently to God, but for whom no relative or friend prays on earth. God makes them benefit from the prayers of other people.

It happens that God permits them to manifest themselves in different way, close to their relatives on earth, in order to remind men of the existence of Purgatory and to solicit their prayers to come close to God who is just, but good.
The majority of people go to Purgatory. Many go to hell. A small number go directly to Heaven. ” 10-JANUARY-1983

William Blake (28 November 1757–12 August 1827) was an English poet, visionary, painter, and printmaker.
During his lifetime he was not very well known. Today Blake's work is thought to be important in the history of both poetry and the visual arts. His most famous poem is "And did those feet in ancient time" which, more than 100 years later, was put to music by Hubert Parry. The hymn is called "Jerusalem".

Institution

An institution is social structure in which people cooperate and which influences the behavior of people and the way they live. 

An institution has a purpose. Institutions are permanent, which means that they do not end when one person is gone. An institution has rules and can enforce rules of human behavior. The word "institution" can be used in two ways. It can mean a very broad idea, or a very "specific" (narrow) one. For example: 

Institutions, in the broad sense, are found in every society. The way that each institution works is different in different cultures. Some important institutions are: 

Some societies have many institutions in the "specific" sense. These societies have an organised government, schools, hospitals, churches, clubs, armies, markets, courts and places for entertainment. Some societies have very few of these things, but this does not mean that there are no "institutions". The way in which the people relate to each other may have just as many "controls" as in a society with schools, markets and a government. An example of a society that has lots of "specific" institutions is Western Europe. An example of a society with very few specific institutions is the society of the Australian Aboriginal people before the 20th century.
Historians look at institutions to find differences between eras or periods. They sometimes judge political and military events by the effect that they had on institutions.

Race (biology)

In biology, races are distinct populations within the same species with relatively small morphological and genetic differences. 

The populations are "ecological races" if they arise from adaptation to different local habitats or "geographic races" when they are geographically isolated. 

If sufficiently different, two or more races can be identified as subspecies, which is an official biological taxonomy unit below 'species'. 

If not, they are called "races", which means that a formal rank should not be given to the group, or taxonomists are unsure whether or not a formal rank should be given. 

According to Ernst Mayr, "a subspecies is a "geographic race" that is sufficiently different taxonomically to be worthy of a separate name" 

The key lime is a shrub that grows to a size of about 5 metres in height. It has many thorns. It produces a fruit that is yellow when it is ripe. This fruit is preferred by bartenders to mix cocktails. They prefer this lime, rather than the Persian lime. 

The plant originally came from Southeast Asia, where it is native. It was spread to the Middle East. Crusaders took it to Europe and North Africa. Spanish explorers took it to the West Indies. This included the Keys in Florida. In 1926, a hurricane destroyed most of the population of commercially-grown limes in region. The Persian lime was reintroduced, then.

Some of the original shrubs grew wild, amongst others, in the Florida Keys. It then became apparent that the originally introduced shrubs (now known as "Mexican lime") had modified their fruits. These were darker green than the original Persian limes, they also had a thicker skin.

Modern world

The term Modern Times is used in history to describe the period of time immediately following the Early Modern Times. It means something else than the term "Modernity".

Modernity on the other hand, describes large-scale developments of "society" (including literature and philosophy). Modernism describes an art movement. Neither applies to political, social, or series of events since either the fin de siècle or World War I in a strict sense.

Some events show a new way of perceiving the world. The concept of modernity interprets the general meaning of these events and seeks explanations for major developments; Historians analyse the events taking place in Modern Times, i.e. since the so-called "Middle Ages" (that take their name from being in the middle between Modern and Ancient Times).

<doc id="60259" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60259" title="Phenotype">
Phenotype

The phenotype of an organism is, roughly, the characters (or traits) of an organism. 

It does not mean just 'what you can see on the surface'. Rather, it means anything which can be made visible by suitable means. For example, blood groups are definitely a part of the phenotype. However, they are not visible just by looking at a person.

In biology, the phenotype is distinguished from the genotype. This was proposed by Wilhelm Johannsen in 1911 to make clear the difference between an organism's heredity and what that heredity produces. The distinction is similar to that proposed by August Weismann, who distinguished between "germ plasm" (gametes or their stem cells) and "somatic cells" (the body).

The phenotype is important because is exposed to natural selection:

Phenotypes are determined partly by genes and are influenced by environmental factors. So, knowing the genome of an organism does not give an exact prediction of its phenotype.

The interaction between genotype and phenotype has often been conceptualized by the following relationship:

The term 'phenotype' must include characteristics that can be made visible by some technical procedure (such as blood types). Another extension adds behaviour to the phenotype since behaviours are also affected by both genotypic and environmental factors.

The idea of the extended phenotype has been developed by Richard Dawkins to mean all the effects a gene has on the outside world that may influence its chances of being inherited. These can be effects on the organism carrying the trait, the environment, or other organisms. For instance, a beaver dam might be considered a phenotype of beaver genes, the same way beavers' powerful incisor teeth are phenotype expressions of their genes. Dawkins also cites the effect of an organism on the behaviour of another organism (such as the devoted nurturing of a cuckoo by a parent clearly of a different species) as an example of the extended phenotype.

Key lime

The Key lime is a citrus fruit. Its Latin name is "Citrus aurantiifolia" (often, less correctly: "C. aurantifolia"), or "Citrus" x "aurantiifolia" (Christm.) Swingle. It is also known as the Mexican lime, West Indian lime or Bartender's lime. It is a shrub that grows to about 5m in height. 

Its fruit is 2.5-5 cm in diameter (1-2 in). The fruit is yellow when ripe but usually it is picked green. It is smaller, seedier, has a higher acidity, a stronger aroma, and a thinner rind than that of the more common Persian lime. It is valued for its unique flavor compared to other lime. The key lime usually has a more tart and bitter flavor. It is perhaps most distinguished as an ingredient in the Key lime pie. 

"C. aurantiifolia" is a shrubby tree , that grows to 5 m (16 ft), with many thorns. Dwarf varieties are popular with home growers and can be grown indoors in winter in colder climates. The trunk rarely grows straight, with many branches that often originate quite far down on the trunk. The leaves are ovate 2.5–9 cm (1–3.5 in) long. They resemble orange leaves (the scientific name "aurantiifolia" refers to the leaves' resemblance). The flowers are 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter. They are yellowish white with a light purple tinge on the margins. Flowers and fruit appear throughout the year but are most abundant from May to September .

"C. aurantiifolia" originally came from Southeast Asia. It was introduced through the Middle East to North Africa and Europe during the Crusades. Spanish explorers then took it to the West Indies (at some point including the Florida Keys) contemporaneously with Columbus, then tropical and sub-tropical North America including Mexico, Florida, and later California . The English name "lime" was derived from the Persian name لیمو "Limu" in this course. "Key" would seem to have been added some time after the Persian lime cultivar became more important commercially in the United States. This was after the hurricane of 1926. The hurricane destroyed most U.S. "C. aurantiifolia" plants. Some plants growing in the wild in the Keys survived the hurricane. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement came into effect, many Key limes are grown in Mexico and Central America. They are also grown in Texas and California.

Persian lime

Persian Lime ("Citrus x latifolia"), also known as Tahiti lime or Bearss lime is a kind of citrus fruit. It is the primary citrus fruit grown commercially in the U.S. It is sold simply as a "lime". The fruit is about 6 cm in diameter. Very often, it has slightly nippled ends. It is usually sold quite green, although it yellows as it reaches full ripeness. It is larger, thicker-skinned, and less aromatic than the key lime. The key lime is grown more often worldwide. The Persian lime is bigger than the key lime, and has fewer seeds. The plant is also hardier, and has no thorns on the bushes. The fruit also has a longer shelf life. 
Persian limes are less acidic than key limes and do not have the bitterness that lends to the key lime's unique flavour. Persian limes are sold primarily in six sizes, known as 110's, 150's, 175's, 200's, 230's and 250's. They are grown primarily in Florida in the U.S. The Persian lime became more important when key lime orchards were wiped out by a hurricane in 1926. Persian lime orchards themselves were devastated by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Large numbers of Persian limes are grown, processed and exported every year primarily from Martínez de la Torre, Veracruz, Mexico, to the American, European and Asian markets. U.S. Persian lime imports from Mexico are handled mostly through McAllen, Texas.

Kaffir lime

The Kaffir lime ("Citrus hystrix "DC., Rutaceae), also known as kieffer lime, makrut, or magrood, is a citrus fruit native to Indonesia. It is widely grown worldwide as a backyard shrub. People usually grow it for its fruit, the lime. The leaves are used for cooking. Vegetable oil obtained from the leaves is used to make perfumes. 

The plant is a very thorny bush with aromatic leaves. The oil obtained from the rind of the fruit can be used as an insecticide. The plant is well-suited to being grown in a container. The green lime fruits are different from other limes because of their bumpy and rough exterior. They are also quite small, about 4 centimetres wide. The leaves are shaped like an hourglass. The leaves, and the leaf-shaped stem are widely used in the cuisine of Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos.

"Citrus x hystrix" leaves are also popular in Cambodia, but less so in Vietnam. Malay, Burmese and Indonesian (especially, Balinese and Javanese; see also Indonesian bay leaf) cuisines use them sporadically with chicken and fish. 

The leaves can be used fresh or dried, and can be stored frozen. 

Although the most common product of the "Citrus x hystrix" tree is its leaves (which give a sharp Lime/neroli flavour to Cambodian base paste known as "Krueng", Thai dishes such as tom yum, and to Indonesian food such as sayur assam - literally "sour vegetables"), the juice and rinds of the small, dark green gnarled fruit (known as jeruk obat - literally "medicine citrus") are used in traditional Indonesian medicine. 

As for the zest, it is widely used in creole cuisine and to impart flavor to "arranged" rums in the Réunion island and Madagascar.

Other names for "Citrus x hystrix":

"The Oxford Companion to Food" (ISBN 0-19-211579-0) recommends that the name "kaffir lime" should be avoided in favor of "makrut lime" because "Kaffir" is an offensive term in certain cultures, and also has no clear reason for being attached to this plant. However, "kaffir lime" appears to be much more common.

Medina

Medina IPA:/mɛˈdiːnə/ (Arabic:المدينة المنور IPA:ælmæˈdiːnæl muˈnɑwːɑrɑ or المدينة IPA:ælmæˈdiːnæ; also transliterated into English as Madīnah; officially al Madīnat al Munawwarah) is a city in the Hejaz region of western Saudi Arabia. It is the capital of Al Madinah Province. It is the second holiest city in Islam, and the burial place of its prophet, Muhammad.

Medina currently has a population of more than 1,300,000 people (2006). The city was originally known as "Yathrib", but later its name was changed to Madīnat al-Nabī (مدينة ﺍﻟﻨﺒﻲ "city of the prophet") or "Al Madīnah al Munawwarah" ("the enlightened city" or "the radiant city"). The short form "Madīnah" simply means "city". Madina is the second holiest city of Islam, after Mecca (Makkah). 

Medina is very important to Muslims. This is because the Prophet Muhammad is buried in a mosque known as 'Masjid-e-Nabawi' or 'The Mosque of The Prophet'. The Mosque was built on a site next to Muhammad's home. Muslims believe that Prophets must be buried at the very same place that they die. Accordingly, Muhammad was buried in his house. The tomb later became part of the mosque when it was expanded by the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I. The first mosque of Islam is also located in Medina. It is known as "Masjid Quba," (the Quba Mosque).

Like Mecca, the city of Medina only permits Muslims to enter. The "haram" (area closed to non-Muslims) of Medina is much smaller than that of Mecca, though. Many facilities on the outskirts of Medina are open to non-Muslims. In Mecca the area closed to non-Muslims extends well beyond the limits of the built-up area. Both cities' numerous mosques are the destination for large numbers of Muslims on their annual pilgrimage. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims come to Medina each year to visit the 'Tomb of Prophet' and to worship at mosques in a unified celebration. Muslims believe that praying once in the Mosque of the Prophet is equal to praying at least 1000 times in any other mosque.

 Muslims believe that praying once in the Mosque of the Prophet is better to praying at least 1000 times in any other mosque.

Doctrine

Doctrine (Latin: "doctrina") is a code of beliefs or "a body of teachings".

Doctrine often means several religious dogmas that a church teaches. 
But it can also mean a principle of law, in the common law traditions, established through a history of past decisions, such as the doctrine of self-defense, or the principle of fair use.

In matters of foreign policy, a doctrine, also known as dogma, is group of fundamental rules for a nation's foreign policy. Examples include the Monroe Doctrine, the Stimson Doctrine, the Truman Doctrine, the Eisenhower Doctrine, the Nixon Doctrine, the Brezhnev Doctrine, the Kirkpatrick doctrine, and the Bush Doctrine.

Examples of religious doctrines include:

One department of the Roman Curia is called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.

The term also applies to the concept of an established procedure to a complex operation in warfare. The typical example is tactical doctrine in which a standard set of maneuvers, kinds of troops and weapons are employed as a default approach to a kind of attack.

Examples of military doctrines include:

Citron

The citron ("Citrus medica") is a species of citrus fruit. It usually has a thick rind and small sections. Originally, the tree came from Southeast Asia. Today it is mainly grown in Sicily, Morocco, Crete, and Corsica, as well as Puerto Rico. The tree can grow to a size of about 3 metres. The fruit can grow to a size of about 25 cm in length, and about 4 kg in weight. The pulp of the fruit is hardly ever used. The rind is used. It is made into an additive for cooking. Jam can also be made from the rind. The rind is also used to make vegetable oil, which is used for perfumes.

Generally, it is eaten preserved or in bakery goods, such as fruitcakes. (The candied peel rather than the fruit is often used in cooking.) In some cultures, it is made into a fruity tea. Pliny the Elder states that in his time , the citron could only be grown in Media and Persia ("HN" xii.7). The Romans tried to transport it into the Roman Empire in tightly packed pots, but failed, according to Pliny. There is evidence, however, which shows it was cultivated in the Mediterranean during Pliny's lifetime. Zohary and Hopf believe this tree was first domesticated in India. They think that its wild forms, along with those of the mandarin and pomelo, were the original citrus species.

The citron has many names in different countries; one popular reference is "Cedrat", which is the French name for the fruit. Theophrastus referred to the citron as the Persian or Median Apple, and the fruit later came to be known as the Citrus Apple. Pliny calls the tree the Assyrian, or the Median, "apple" (the generic Greco-Roman name for globose fruits). Other citrus crops were not introduced to the Mediterranean basin until Islamic times.

In many languages other than English, a normal lemon is called a "citron" and a Lime is called a "limon". Although the East Asian citrus fruit "yuzu" (also called "yuja") is sometimes called a citron, it is actually a separate species, "Citrus junos". 

The citron fruit is slow-growing. The citron tree is typically grown from cuttings that are two to four years old; the tree begins to bear fruit when it is around three years old. The fruit is oblong in shape, and sometimes as much as six inches in length. Its skin is thick, somewhat hard, fragrant, and covered with protuberances; the pulp is white and subacid. 

In Pliny's time the fruit was never eaten (it began to be used in cooking by the early 2nd century), but its intense perfume was used, penetrating clothes to repel noxious insects (compare Citronella). 

In Hebrew, the citron is known as the etrog (Hebrew: אֶתְרֹג). It is one of the Four Species used during the holiday of Sukkot each fall. The role of the citron in that holiday was portrayed in the Israeli movie Ushpizin. Citrons that have been bred with lemon (in order to increase output per tree and make the tree less fragile) are not kosher for use as part of the Four Species.

In South Indian cuisine, especially Tamil cuisine, citron is widely used in pickles and preserves. In Tamil, the unripe fruit is referred to as 'narthangai', which is usually salted and dried to make a preserve. The tender leaves of the plant are often used in conjunction with chili powder and other spices to make a powder, called 'narthellai podi', literally translating to 'powder of citron leaves'. Both narthangai and narthellai podi are usually consumed with 'thayir sadam' (Curd Rice - Yogurt Rice).

In Korea, it is used to create a syrupy tea (called Yuja cha) where the slices of whole fruit are eaten with the sweet tea. The fruit is thinly sliced (peel, pith and pulp) and soaked or cooked in honey or sugar to create a chunky syrup. This syrupy candied fruit is mixed with hot water as a fragrant tea, where the fruit at the bottom of the cup is eaten as well. Often perserved in the syrup for the cold months, Yuja tea served as a source of fruit in winter. It is also popular in Taiwan, where it is known as 柚子茶 (Youzi cha).

Carl Wilhelm Scheele was the first who could extract citric acid from lemons, in 1782. The substance was probably known to alchemists, perhaps with a different name. The Arabian alchemist Geber is said to have discovered citric acid in the 9th century. Citric Acid contains 6 Carbon atoms, 8 Hydrogen atoms and 7 Oxygen atoms. Its chemical formula is CHO.

He has also been widely referred to as the "father of chemistry". Ibn Hayyan is widely credited with the introduction of the experimental method into alchemy, and with the invention of numerous important processes still used in modern chemistry today, such as the syntheses of hydrochloric and nitric acids, distillation, and crystallisation. His original works are highly esoteric and probably coded, though nobody today knows what the code is. On the surface, his alchemical career revolved around an elaborate chemical numerology based on consonants in the Arabic names of substances and the concept of "takwin", the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory.

A piano trio is a group of three instruments including a piano. Usually it is a piano, a violin and a cello. This combination of instruments has been a very popular form of chamber music from the Classical music period onwards. A piano trio can also mean a piece of music written for a piano trio to play.

Other combinations of piano with two instruments are often called by the featuring wind instrument. For example: Mozart wrote a trio for piano, clarinet and viola which is usually called a “clarinet trio”. Brahms wrote a trio for piano, violin and French horn which is usually called a “horn trio”.

Music for three people to play at one piano is called music for piano six hands.

Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all wrote several piano trios for the traditional combination of piano, violin and cello. Beethoven’s last piano trio has the nickname "Archduke" because it was written for the Archduke Rudolph. Franz Schubert wrote two beautiful piano trios.

In the Romantic period some of the best piano trios were written by Felix Mendelssohn, Antonín Dvořák, César Franck and Pyotr Tchaikovsky.

In the 20th century Maurice Ravel and Dmitri Shostakovich each wrote a famous piano trio.

Alfred Cortot, Jacques Thibaud and Pablo Casals were world famous musicians who played and recorded piano trios in the early 20th century.
During the second half of the 20th century the Beaux Arts Trio were the best known group. Today there are many young musicians who play piano trios, including three Japanese sisters called the Fujita Piano Trio who play a lot of their music all from memory.

Two other famous plays are "Des Meeres und der Liebe Wellen" ("The Waves of the Sea and of Love") and "Der Traum, ein Leben" ("The Dream, a Life"). Although he said he was not interested in prose his short story "Der arme Spielmann" ("The poor minstrel") is probably the best known of his works and one of the best short stories of the 19th century. Grillparzer wrote the funeral speech for Beethoven's funeral in 1827.

An Austrian pastry is named after him: the Grillparzertorte.

Johann Georg Albrechtsberger

Johann Georg Albrechtsberger (born 3 February 1736 in Klosterneuburg near Vienna; died 7 March 1809 in Vienna) was an Austrian composer, organist, music theorist and music teacher. He is most known today because he was Beethoven’s teacher for a time.

From the age of seven, Albrechtsberger was a choirboy. He had lessons in organ and music theory. As an adult, he had several jobs in churches in small towns. He became Kapellmeister at St Stephen’s Church, Vienna in 1793. This was the best job for a church musician in the empire.

Albrechtsberger wrote hundreds of compositions. He wrote most of them before he got the job in Vienna. He wrote in a classical style. Albrechsberger enjoyed doing things with music which were not normally done. He would ask string players to tune their strings in different ways (called “scordatura”). He would also write slow movements with muted strings. As well as classical sonatas he wrote lots of fugues. Several people, including Mozart, thought of him as the greatest organist in the world.

Albrechtsberger was a very important music teacher. Joseph Haydn thought he was the best teacher in Vienna. He was very interested in contrapuntal music of the Baroque period. He copied many fugues by Bach and other composers.

When Beethoven was a young man, he had some composition lessons from Joseph Haydn. When Haydn was going to travel to England for several months, he asked Albrechtsberger to teach Beethoven while he was gone. These lessons took place from 1793 to 1795. A few years later, Albrechtsberger said about Beethoven that “he learned absolutely nothing and will never accomplish anything decent”. Beethoven said that Albrechtsberger was a “musical pedant”.. However, Beethoven still studied Albrechtsberger’s books on music theory. The string quartets which Beethoven wrote near the end of his life show the influence of Albrechtsberger.

Fidelio

Fidelio is an opera in two acts by Ludwig van Beethoven. It is Beethoven's only opera. The German libretto is by Joseph Sonnleithner based on a French story. The opera tells how Leonore, disguised as a prison guard called "Fidelio", rescues her husband Florestan from death in a political prison.

"Fidelio" is an example of a “rescue opera”, a type of opera which was popular at the time. The hero (or heroine) has to fight against cruel people in order to rescue a lover. It was written at the time of the French Revolution. At this time, ideas about freedom and peace were being talked about by everyone, and this led to wars all over Europe. The famous Prisoners’ Chorus is a song for freedom, just like the last movement of his Ninth Symphony.

Beethoven spent some time working on the opera before he was completely happy with it. The first time it was performed (in 1805) it was a three-act opera called "Leonore". There were a lot of French military officers in the audience and they thought they were being criticised. In 1806 it was performed again with two acts and a new overture (now known as "Overture: Leonore No. 3"). But arguments between Beethoven and the theatre management meant there were no more performances. Eight years later Beethoven revised his opera again. This time it was called "Fidelio", and it was a great success. It has remained a famous opera ever since.

The setting is a Spanish state prison, a few miles from Seville, in the late 1700s.

Jaquino is a prison guard. He wants to marry Marzelline, the daughter of Rocco who is the warden of the prison. But Marzelline has just fallen in love with someone she thinks is a man called Fidelio. Actually Fidelio is a woman who has dressed up as a man so that she can get into the prison where her husband Florestan is a prisoner (he has been arrested for political reasons). She is pretending to return Marzelline’s love so that she can find a way of rescuing Florestan. Rocco says he is happy for Marzelline to marry Fidelio. Fidelio (Leonore) says she will help Rocco with his job of looking after the prisoners. Rocco says she can do this, but there is one prisoner she is not allowed to guard. He has been locked up alone for two years. Leonore thinks it may be her husband, but she is not sure.

Don Pizzaro, the military governor of the prison, hears that the prison is going to be looked at by inspectors who make sure that the prison is being properly managed. He knows that he should not have locked Florestan up, so decides to kill him before the inspection starts. He asks Rocco to dig the grave so that he can get rid of the body quickly. Rocco does not want to do this, but has to agree.

Leonore lets the prisoners have a walk in the garden. Rocco tells Leonore that he must help him dig the grave. Rocco is very cross that the prisoners are walking in the garden, but Rocco says they should be allowed because it is the King’s name-day. Rocco says they should be locked up again.

Florestan sits alone in his cell. In his mind he imagines an angel who looks like his wife who his telling him to come to Heaven.

Leonore goes with Rocco to the prisoner. She is still not sure whether it is her husband. She gives him some bread. When Pizarro comes he gets ready to kill Florestan, but Leonore stands between them and tells Pizarro she will shoot him if he comes nearer. A trumpet is heard playing a fanfare because the Minister is arriving.

Outside the prison the Minister says that all the prisoners are now free. He is horrified to find Florestan among the prisoners, because he is his friend. The crowd ask for Pizarro to be punished. Leonore frees her husband from his chains and the crowd say that she is a great heroine.

Beethoven made several changes to the opera at different times. This included writing four different overtures. They are called "Leonore 1", "Leonore 2", "Leonore 3" and "Fidelio". The overture "Fidelio" is the one that is normally heard now at the beginning of the opera. "Leonore 2" was the overture performed at the first performance in 1805. "Leonore 3", composed in 1806, is the most famous of the overtures. "Leonore 1" may have been written in 1805, or it may have been intended for a performance in 1807 in Prague which never took place". Sometimes the "Leonore 3" overture is played during Act II between the two scenes. However, many people think it does not work dramatically there. It is usually heard today as a separate concert piece. The overture "Fidelio" was composed for performances of the opera in 1814.

Für Elise

"Für Elise" (meaning "For Elise") is the popular title of the "Bagatelle in A minor", for piano by Ludwig van Beethoven. It is one of the most popular pieces of piano music in the world. Many young pianists want to learn to play it.

We do not know who Elise was. It might have been a lady called Therese whom Beethoven wanted to marry in 1810, but she did not want to marry him. The piece was not published until 1865, a long time after Beethoven’s death.

The piece is in rondo form. There is a main section which comes three times. Between these three sections there are two other sections, so the form of the piece can be described as 

The main section has a time signature of 3/8. It is based on arpeggios which flow from one hand to the other. This is the section that many beginner pianists try to play. The two middle sections are harder to play at the correct speed. They have fast scales, arpeggios and left hand demisemiquavers (32nd notes).

Teplice

Teplice (German name: Teplitz) is a small town in Bohemia, the western area of the Czech Republic. Teplice (pronounced in Czech: “Tep-li-tse”) is a famous spa town where, in earlier times, lots of famous people went for holidays to improve their health. Goethe, Beethoven, Chopin, Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner all stayed there.

Teplice lies between Prague and Dresden in a mountain area called Krušné hory (Iron Mountains). In the year 762 hot springs were found there. The waters from these springs helped people who were ill to get better so it became a spa town.

Since 1990 many buildings have been restored. The Krušnohorské divadlo (Krušnohorské theatre) is now being refurbished. The North Bohemia Philharmonic Orchestra give concerts there in the open air. There is a museum and many restaurants, wine bars and cafés. In the winter the mountain slopes are good for skiing.

Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)

Symphony No. 9 in D minor op 125 (Choral Symphony) by Ludwig van Beethoven is one of the most famous pieces of music ever written.

A symphony is a piece of music for orchestra. Beethoven wrote nine symphonies. This one, the last one he wrote, is very unusual because the last movement also has singing in it: there are four soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass) and a choir. This is why it is known as the “choral” symphony (“choral” means: “for choir”). It is a very long work, lasting more than an hour. This, too, was unusual.

This symphony has four movements. The first movement is in sonata form. The second and third movements come the other way round from the usual order: the second movement is the scherzo and the third movement is the slow movement. It is a theme and variations. The last movement sets the words of a poem by Friedrich Schiller, a famous poet who had only recently died. The poem was called "Ode an die Freude" (in English: "Ode to Joy"). The poem has a strong message to all mankind: it is about living in peace and harmony together. It was written at the time of the French Revolution when these ideas were becoming very important in Europe.

The main tune of the last movement (sung to the words: “Freude, schöne Götterfunken, Tochter aus Elysium”) is one of the best known tunes in the world. Many children like to play it on instruments because the first part of the tune only uses five notes (it can be played on C, D, E, F, G). When the tune comes the first time in the symphony it is played by the cellos and double basses.

The "Ode to Joy" was adopted as Europe's “National anthem” in 1972, with an official arrangement for orchestra written by Herbert von Karajan.

Beethoven had been interested in Schiller’s famous poem since he was young. In 1817 he started to write the first two movements of the symphony. In 1822 he decided to use Schiller’s poem in the symphony. Most of the rest of the symphony was written in 1823 and he finished it in 1824. It was first performed in May of that year. Beethoven conducted the performance. The story is told that he wondered why the audience were not applauding when it had finished. They were applauding, but Beethoven was deaf so he could not hear. Someone made him turn round, and he saw that people were applauding enthusiastically.

The father of the school is Rev Henry Noyes. In 1879, he built a school in Guangzhou, teaching Mathematics and Science. Later he built more schools in Taishan, Jiangmen and Hong Kong.

In 1978, someone built the 5th school which is Pui Ying College. Mr Wong Wai Wah was the Principal. In the first year, the school worked on the campus of Baptist Lui Ming Choi Secondary School at Lek Yuen Estate. In September 1979, the school could move into Wo Che Estate. The school library was opened since September 1982.

In order to make it possible for all the Form 3 students to study as Form 4 in the school, the school changed the class structure. The Student Union was set up in September 1995 and Parent-Teacher Association in 1996. In 1996, Principal Wong gave up working and the Vice Principal Ms Yau Oi Yuen started doing his work. The elite class system was deleted in September, 1996.

The library system was changed to use computer since September 2001. The new wing building of the school has been finished since July 2005. In the new wing, there are classrooms for higher forms classes, a new library, some special rooms and computer rooms.

The school teaches Putonghua. There are many activities such as Putonghua Day, Tongue-Twisters, Putonghua Class, Singing Contest, Putonghua Broadcast and Putonghua Corner. Students in the school can learn more about the Chinese culture from the activities such as Workshop on Chinese clipart, Chinese Tea Tao and Chinese Culture and General Studies Competition.

All Form 1 new students are Band 1 students. All of the Form 3 students can study as Form 4 in the school. Students have good results in public examinations. The average passing percentage for the HKCEE and HKALE is higher than 90%. The best student in HKCEE got 8As in 2004.

All Form 6 students in the school are from the Form 5 in the same school, except the exchange students from other countries. Most of the Form 7 students can study in the universities these years.

According to the government, the school teaches Chinese language, English language and Mathematics very well from 2000 to 2006.

The school gives the good students some awards, such as scholarships, Academic Awards, Flying Eagle Awards and Improvement Awards. The school gives money to some students to take part in some inter-school competition and courses in some universities such as The University of Hong Kong, The Chinese University of Hong Kong and The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. There are some tutorial classes to improve junior students' skills in both English and Chinese languages and also Mathematics.

Reading Time is designed to help students having a good reading habit. Reading Days are held by the school library for all students to read or to take part in activities related to reading.

There are many computer subjects in the school, such as Information Technology (IT) for Forms 1 to 3, Computer and Information Technology (CIT) for Forms 4 and 5, and Computer Applications (CA) for Forms 6 and 7.

The school has organised 3 musicals, The Comeback Kid, Soul for Sale and The Last Move. The songs inside are written by the students and past students. Every Form 1 student has to play at least 1 musical instrument. The Photography Club and the Audio-Visual Group teaches students many skills, such as film editing, image recording, lighting, backdrop setting and sound engineering.

The school invites some guest speakers to the school to give speeches. Students can know more about the political, social and economic issues in Hong Kong and around the world. The school lets the students to join some extracurricular activities such as "The Youth Summit", "Dinner with Outstanding Citizens" and "Hong Kong International Model United Nations". The school lets the students to join mainland and overseas cultural tours.

The students can take leadership-training courses and extracurricular activities, such as activities such as “Youth Leaders Auditorium 2005”, “The 6th Basic Certificate Course for Student Leaders”, “Outstanding Leadership Development Programme” and “Youth Think Tank Training Project”. There are Free Talks so that students can have better training in giving speeches.

This award is only for the students who have good learning habit, good examination results, good self-discipline, good responsibility, community skills and studies in school activities. There are 4 phases in this award. Students can get a Bronze Eagle Badge in Phase 1, a Silver Eagle Badge in Phase 2, a Gold Eagle Badge in Phase 3 and a cup in Phase 4.

There are many activities to teach students about the Christian principles, such as Gospel Week, Gospel Camp Evangelical Team, Evangelical Broadcast, Bible Study Groups and Christian Fellowship.

There is a school song with Chinese lyrics. Its melody is the same as the song O Christmas Tree and there are two paragraphs. There is also a school hymn with English lyrics. There are three paragraphs in this school hymn.

All boys in the school wear white shirts and green trousers, and all girls wear white dresses with green drawstrings as summer uniform. The boys wear grey trousers and the girls wear grey dresses with white socks as winter uniform. Both boys and girls wear green ties when wearing winter uniform.

When students have physical education lessons, they wear PE uniform. From 2000, students can wear PE uniform to school without changing at school. From 2001, the PE uniform has been changed into a new format that is grey and blue in colour. The PE T-shirts have 3 different colours, namely black, blue and red, with respect to the students’ house.

The class names are combined with one number and one English character, such as “7B”. There are about 40 students in each class from Form 1 to Form 5. 1A and 1B are remedial classes whereas 1C to 1E perform better in exams. The classes are mixed when students go into Form 2 or Form 3.

All Form 3 students have to choose their subjects after finishing their year. In Form 4 and 5, A and B are arts classes, C is commercial class, D and E are science classes, with the students and class teachers being together in the same class in both Form 4 and 5.

After the HKCEE, some students study in Form 6. Each class in Form 6 and 7 has about 30 students. The class A is an art class and B is a science class.

Each Form forms a House, with its own chairman and committee members elected by the students in the own Form. Each House has its own colour such as black, blue or red, just like the students’ PE uniform. The forms from the same colours form some cheering teams during the sports days.

There are 2 sports days every year. The sports days take places on the Yuen Wo Road Sports Ground. Besides the various types of sports competitions, there are competitions among the cheering teams. The swimming gala is held every year with the Pui Ying Secondary School. It takes place on the Hong Kong Island or Sha Tin District alternatively every two years.

<doc id="60362" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60362" title="Heuristic">
Heuristic

A heuristic is a way to solve a problem. It is better than chance, but does not always work. It is part of experience, common sense, rule of thumb. Trial and error is the simplest heuristic, but one of the weakest. Since a heuristic is not certain to get a result, there are always exceptions.

Sometimes heuristics are rather vague: 'look before you leap' is a guide to behaviour, but 'think about the consequences' is a bit clearer. Sometimes a heuristic is a whole set of stages. When doctors examines a patient, they go through a whole set of tests and observations. They may not find out what is wrong, but they give themselves the best chance of succeeding.

In Computer science, a 'heuristic' is a kind of algorithm. Algorithms are written to get a good solution to a problem. A heuristic algorithm might usually find pretty good solutions, but there is no guarantee or proof that the solutions are correct. The time it takes to run the algorithm is another consideration.

Here are a few other commonly used heuristics, from Polya's 1945 book, "How to Solve It":

One example where heuristics are useful is a kind of packing problem. The problem consists of packing a number of items. There are rules that need to be respected. For example, each item has a value and a weight. The problem now is to get the most valuable items, with the least weight possible. Another instance is fitting a number of differently-sized items into a confined space, like the trunk of a car.

To get the perfect solution to the problem, all possibilities must be tried. This is often not a good option, as trying them takes a long time, and on average, half the possibilities must be tried until a solution is found. So what most people will do is to start with the biggest item, fit it in, and then try to arrange the other items around it. This will give a good solution, most of the time. There are cases however, where such a solution is very bad and another technique must be used. 

Therefore, this is a heuristic solution.

Mersenne prime

In mathematics, a Mersenne number is a number that is one less than a "power of two".

A Mersenne prime is a "Mersenne number" that is a prime number. ,The exponent "n" must be prime too. This however, is not sufficient. Many mathematicians prefer the definition of a Mersenne number where "n" has to be a prime number.

For example, "31 = 2 − 1", and 5 is a prime number, so 31 is a Mersenne number; and 31 is also a Mersenne prime because it is a prime number. But the Mersenne number "2047 = 2 − 1" is not a prime because it is divisible by 89 and 23. And "2 − 1 = 15" can be shown to be composite because 4 is not prime.

Throughout modern times, the largest known prime number has very often been a Mersenne prime. Most sources restrict the term "Mersenne number" to where "n" is prime, as all Mersenne primes must be of this form as seen below.

Mersenne primes have a close connection to perfect numbers, which are numbers equal to the sum of their proper divisors. Historically, the study of Mersenne primes was motivated by this connection; in the 4th century BC Euclid demonstrated that if "M" is a Mersenne prime then "M"("M"+1)/2 is a perfect number. In the 18th century, Leonhard Euler proved that all even perfect numbers have this form. No odd perfect numbers are known, and it is suspected that none exist (any that do have to belong to a significant number of special forms).

It is currently unknown if there is an infinite number of Mersenne primes. Most mathematicians who have studied the question think there are an infinite number of Mersenne primes. Carl Pomerance, Samuel S. Wagstaff Jr. and Hendrik Lenstra
developed a formula which they think should say about how many Mersenne primes there are under a given number.

The binary representation of 2 − 1 is "n" repetitions of the digit 1.

For example, 2 − 1 = 11111 in binary.

The first four Mersenne primes were known to the Ancient Greeks. They are 3, 7, 31 and 127. The next, 8191, was discovered in 1456. Some people like trying to find big primes. Since there are tricks to finding Mersenne primes quickly, the largest primes known are usually Mersenne primes.

Solar radiation

Solar radiation is the energy given off by the sun in all directions. When this energy reaches the earth's surface, it is called insolation.

Solar radiation gives out light and heat to the earth in the form of electromagnetic waves. It has different wave lengths. Radiation such as ultraviolet radiation, X rays and visible light have short wave lengths. Infrared radiation has a long wave length.

The atmosphere affects the amount of solar radiation received. When solar radiation travels through the atmosphere, some of it is absorbed by the atmosphere(16%). Some of it is scattered to space (6%). Some of it is reflected by clouds (28%). About 47% of it reaches the earth's surface.

Insolation

Insolation is the solar radiation that reaches the earth's surface. It is measured by the amount of solar energy received per square centimetre per minute.

Insolation affects temperature. The more the insolation, the higher the temperature.

In any given day, the strongest insolation is received at noon.

Factors affect insolation (without the effect of the atmosphere):

The longer the duration of daylight, the more the insolation received.

Hugo Chávez

Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías (IPA: ) (born July 28, 1954) is the current president of Venezuela. He is the leader of the "Bolivarian Revolution" and promotes his vision of democratic socialism, Latin American integration, and anti-imperialism. Chávez is also an ardent critic of neoliberal globalization and U.S. foreign policy.

Chávez is career military officer. He founded the left-wing Fifth Republic Movement after a failed coup d'état against former President Carlos Andrés Pérez. Chávez was

elected to serve as president in 1998. This was mainly because he promised to help the poor majority of Venezuelan people. He was re-elected in 2000, and 2006. He started a movement called Bolivarian Missions. Its goal is to fight disease, illiteracy, malnutrition, poverty, and other social problems. Abroad, Chávez is known for supporting alternative models of economic development. He has also spoken in favor of a collaboration of poor nations, especially those in Latin America. 
Chávez's reforms have caused controversy, both inside Venezuela, and outside the country. Some people criticized the reforms, others supported them. Those people who support the reforms say that he has given more power to the poor, and that he has stimulated economic growth. Those who argue against the reforms say that he is an autocrat who has mismanaged the economy.

Some governments, especially the government of the United States see Chávez as a threat to global oil prices, as well as to regional stability. Others sympathize with his ideology or welcome his bilateral trade and reciprocal aid agreements.
In 2005 and 2006 he was named one of "Time" magazine's 100 most influential people.

Granule (cell biology)

In cell biology, a granule can be any structure barely visible by light microscopy. The term is most often used to describe a secretory vesicle.

A group of leukocytes called granulocytes contain granules and play an important role in the immune system. The granules of certain cells, such as Natural killer cells, contain components which can lead to the lysis of neighboring cells. 

The granules of platelets are classified as dense granules and alpha granules.

Cytosol

The cytosol (cf. "cytoplasm", which also includes the organelles) is the internal fluid of the cell, and a part of cell metabolism occurs here. 

Proteins within the cytosol play an important role in signal transduction pathways and glycolysis. 

Cytosol mostly consists of water, dissolved ions, small molecules, and large water-soluble molecules (such as protein). It contains about 20% to 30% protein.

Normal human cytosolic pH is (roughly) 7.0 (i.e. neutral), whereas the pH of the extracellular fluid is 7.4.

The texture of cytosol being described as granular can be attributed to the fact that in order to study the texture, an electron microsope must be used, which requires a process of dehydration prior to study.

Marble

Marble is a metamorphic rock that developed from limestone. Most of the material is calcite (a crystalline form of calcium carbonate, CaCO). 
It is often used for sculpture, as a building material, and for many other purposes. 

The word 'marble' is also used for other stones that can be polished well and for ball shaped objects used for child games. 

Faux marble or faux marbling is a wall painting technique that imitates the color patterns of real marble (not to be confused with paper marbling). Marble dust can be combined with cement or synthetic resins to make "reconstituted" or "cultured marble".

Places named after the stone include Marble Arch, London; the Sea of Marmara; India's Marble Rocks; and the towns of Marble, Minnesota; Marble, Colorado; and Marble Hill, Manhattan, New York. The Elgin Marbles are marble sculptures from the Parthenon that are on display in the British Museum. They were brought to Britain by the Earl of Elgin.

Some historically important kinds of marble, named after the locations of their quarries, include:

White marbles, like Carrara in Italy, Royal White and Beijing White in China, have been prized for sculpture since classical times. This preference has to do with the softness and relative isotropy and homogeneity, and a relative resistance to shattering. Also, the low index of refraction of calcite allows light to penetrate several millimeters into the stone before being scattered out, resulting in the characteristic "waxy" look which gives "life" to marble sculptures of the human body.

In the construction trade, the term "marble" is used for any massive, crystalline calcitic rock (and some non-calcitic rocks) useful as building stone. For example, Tennessee Marble is really a massive, highly fossiliferous gray to pink to maroon Ordovician dolostone, known as the Holston Formation by geologists.

Colorless marbles are a very pure source of calcium carbonate, which is used in a wide variety of industries. Finely ground marble powder is a component in paints, toothpaste, and plastics; calcium carbonate can also be reduced under high heat to calcium oxide (also known as "lime"), which has many applications including being a primary component of most cements.

Marble is dense, with a good range of colors. It can be carved or shaped, and is strong, and many think it beautiful.

Fan fiction or fanfiction (also known as fanfic) is a name for fiction created by fans instead of the original author.

Fanfiction writers take fictional characters and settings from fictional (or sometimes historical) stories that were created by other people, and write original stories about them. People write fan fiction for a many different book, television series or movie fandoms.

When fanfiction first began, it was often only published in fan magazines. Today fanfiction, like many fandom activities, can be usually found on the internet. This has created many fanfiction communities. People in these communities post their fanfiction and receive feedback (reviews) from other community members.

There is also fan art (also called fanart), which is often drawings or other visual art based on a fandom.

Three Laws of Robotics

The Three Laws of Robotics are three rules which Isaac Asimov thought would be programmed into robots. The rules assume robots will be human-type machines, able to walk about and do things. The laws are presented in his 'Robot' series of short stories and novels.

The first mention of the laws is in Asimov's short story "Runaround" (written in 1942). 
Later, Asimov added the Zeroth Law: "A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm"; the rest of the laws are modified sequentially to acknowledge this.

According to the "Oxford English Dictionary," the passage in Asimov's short story "Liar!" (1941) that mentions the First Law is the earliest recorded use of the word "robotics". Asimov was not aware of this at the time; he assumed the word already existed by analogy with "mechanics," "hydraulics," and other similar terms denoting branches of applied knowledge.

The Three Laws form a theme in his "Robot" series and the other stories linked to it, as well as his Lucky Starr series of science fiction for children. Other authors working in Asimov's fictional universe have adopted them, and references (often parodic) appear in science fiction and other genres. Technologists in the field of artificial intelligence have speculated upon the role the Laws might have in the future.

Grenade

A grenade is a weapon that is meant to do heavy destruction, that is to destroy things. Some different types of grenades:


Hand-held grenades are grenades used by the infantry (soldiers). There are three main types: one which gives a big powerful blast to destroy bunkers, another which starts fires and another which contains shrapnel to hurt enemy soldiers.
A hand-held grenade is usually shaped like an egg (with shell), with a metal-arm on its top and a ring. When you pull out the ring, the arm flips up and ignites a fuse. The user then has a few seconds to throw it and take cover, usually about 5 seconds. It explodes on impact and is very deadly.

An early type of hand-held grenade was a iron-ball, filled with gunpowder and with a long fuse that its user must light up with a match before throwing. The German army used stick grenades (grenades with handles) during World War One and World War Two.

The most commonly used grenade, and it comes in all sizes, from 50mm cannons against aircraft, to 105mm shots in tanks, to up to 50cm or more mounted on great battleships or coastal fortresses.
It works the same way as a gun, but instead of just a lead bullet, the shell is packed with explosives like TNT. An artillery-grenade can do a lot of damage when it explodes.

Airplane-ammo-grenades are used in machine-cannons mounted on either warplanes or gunships (helicopters built for war). It is the same shape as a normal shot, but much bigger. It consist of a tube with an ignition mechanism in its rear, which throws out the shell very quickly. The shell is loaded with TNT or any other type of explosive.

Nathuram Godse

Nathuram Vinayak Godse (Marathi: नथूराम गोडसे)( नात्थूराम विनायक गोडसे , ਨਥੂਰਾਮ ਵਿਨਾਯਕ ਗੋਡਸੇ ) (May 19, 1910 – November 15, 1949), born at Baramati, Pune District, India was the man who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi.

Nathuram Godse was born on May 19, 1910. His father was Vinayak Vaman Rao Godse, his mother Lakshmi (Godavari before marriage). His father was a fifteen-rupee-a-month employee of the post office. 

Godse dropped out of high school and became an activist with the Hindu Mahasabha. 
The Hindu Mahasabha had initially backed Gandhi's campaigns of civil disobedience against the British government.
But Godse and his mentors later rejected Gandhi. They felt that Gandhi was sacrificing Hindu interests in an effort to please minority groups. They blamed Gandhi for the Partition of India, which killed hundreds of thousands of people.

The immediate motive for the assassination is usually ascribed to Gandhi's January 13, 1948 decision to fast to the death unless the Indian central government reversed a decision to withhold the transfer of 55 crore (550 million) rupees to the government of Pakistan. The transfer had been specified in the partition agreement, but the Indian government had refused to complete it, complaining of continued Pakistani rebel occupation of disputed parts of Kashmir.

The Indian government immediately reversed its decision to withhold the funds, which infuriated Godse and his fellow Hindu radicals.

It is far from clear whether or not the decision to assassinate Gandhi was taken by Godse alone, or whether he had consulted with other Mahasabha members, or even received their help in carrying out the assassination. The Mahasabha resolutely denied all complicity, and Godse took full responsibility. However, many critics believe that Godse did not act alone. 

Godse assassinated Gandhi on January 30, 1948, approaching him during the evening prayer, bowing, and shot him three times at close range.

Doronpa is a very strict nationalist, a racist, and a xenophobe. He has strong prejudice towards Korean and Chinese people. He thinks that Japanese colonization of Korea was good. He also believes that the Second Sino-Japanese War between China and Japan was a holy war for Japan.

Doronpa is the leader of a group of Japanese people who believed that many of the special rights given to Korean people were wrong. The group is called (in Japanese) "在日特権を許さない市民の会". In English, it means "Meeting of the citizens who do not permit resident privilege." The group believes Japanese people must stop the Korean people from having special rights. This group had over 1000 members as of May 2007. The group is one of the main groups against Koreans or Chinese people in Japan today.

Doronpa has made many comments about how he believes the Korean and Chinese people do not think human life is as important as other people think it is. 
After the Virginia Tech shooting on April 16, 2007, Doronpa wrote about it in his blog. He said that these two comments show his thinking that Koreans and Chinese are unethical and have bad morals.

Glycolysis

Glycolysis is a metabolic process in most organisms. It is the first stage in cellular respiration. It allows both aerobic and anaerobic respiration. 

Glycolysis is thought to be the archetype of a universal metabolic pathway. It occurs, with variations, in nearly all organisms, both aerobic and anaerobic. The wide occurrence of glycolysis shows that it is one of the most ancient known metabolic pathways.

Glycolysis has ten intermediate compounds, catalysed by ten different enzymes. Only the broad outline is described here.
The metabolism of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate is started ('kicked off') by energy from 2 ATP molecules.

The second half of glycolysis is known as the 'pay-off phase', by the net gain of the energy-rich molecules ATP and NADH. Since glucose leads to two triose sugars in the preparatory phase, each reaction in the pay-off phase occurs twice per glucose molecule. This yields 2 NADH molecules and 4 ATP molecules, leading to a net gain of 2 NADH molecules and 2 ATP molecules from the glycolytic pathway per glucose molecule.

Summary: 2ATP --> 4ATP + 2NADH + H+ + 2 pyruvate (net production of 2ATP)

Cells performing aerobic respiration (respiration using oxygen) synthesize much more ATP, but not as part of glycolysis. These further reactions use the pyruvate from glycolysis. 

Eukaryote aerobic respiration produces about 30 additional molecules of ATP for each glucose molecule.
Glycolysis, through anaerobic respiration, is the main energy source in many cells.

Archetype

In psychology, an archetype is a model of a person, personality, or behavior. 

In the analysis of personality, the term "archetype" is often broadly used to refer to

But in a strict linguistic sense, an archetype is merely a defining "example" of a personality type. In this sense "mother figure" can be considered an archetype and instances can be found in various female characters with distinct personalities.

Archetypes have been present in mythology and literature for hundreds of years. The use of archetypes to analyze personality was advanced by Carl Jung early in the 20th century. The value in using archetypal characters in fiction derives from the fact that a large group of people are able to unconsciously recognize the archetype, and thus the motivations, behind the character's behavior.

The word "archetype" appeared in European texts as early as 1545. It derives from the Latin noun "archetypum" via the Greek noun "arkhetypon" and adjective "arkhetypos", meaning "first-moulded". The Greek roots are "arkhe-" ("first" or "original") + "typos" ("model", "type", "blow", "mark of a blow").

Microdon

Flies in the genus (group) Microdon are different from most other flies because they are myrmecophiles, which means they live in ant colonies (nests). There are more than 350 species (different kinds) of "Microdon" in the world. The most "Microdon" live in the tropics; 30 species live in North America (Thompson 1981).

"Microdon" adults are very hairy and look like bees. They are 8 to 15 mm long. The antennae are almost as long as the fly's face. These flies have black or pale (white or golden) hairs, and their bodies are either black or metallic green or blue.

The larvae of "Microdon" flies look strange. They are very round and look like stout little slugs. At first scientists thought they were mollusks and scale insects (Duffield 1981). They move slowly.

Adult "Microdon" flies do not hover around flowers such as many other flies; instead they remain close to the ant colonies where they grew up.

Larvae may be found very deep in ant nests. Some "Microdon" larvae eat ant larvae (Duffield 1981); others are scavengers, which means they eat dead plants or insects in the ant colony. Most "Microdon" larvae can only live in the colony of one kind of ant.

Not much is known about "Microdon" flies because their larvae live in ant nests where it is difficult to see them.

Pattern

A pattern is an idea, a concept or a model. The model is usually abstract, and can then be applied to the domain where it is used. Pattern matching is checking if a certain pattern is present. Many patterns can directly be recognised by the senses. 

Some patterns are based on the fact that there are repetitions, that a certain thing occurs over and over again. An example of a simple pattern might be the tiling of a floor. For example, lots of bathrooms have a paisley or floral tiling pattern on the floor.
In Computer science, Design patterns are model solutions for problems that occur very often.

In Mathematics, there are many different patterns. For example, the Fibonacci sequence is a complex type of pattern. There are some simple ones like:

1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

In this pattern, the next number is the product of the previous number multiplied by 2. Basically a mathematical pattern is a sequence of numbers which follows one rule.

Some types of emulators require newer computers that have the right system requirements. For example, you need a processor that is fast enough to meet the demands of the emulator. Memory (both RAM and hard drive space) may be another factor to help it run smoothly and more accurately.

Up to the advent of Christianity the term was not used like that in the Greek-speaking world. Orthodoxy is opposed to "heterodoxy" ('other teaching'), "heresy" and "schism". People who profess a doctrine considered to be false by the majority are most often called heretics. People who separate themselves from the body of believers, i.e. from full communion, are called schismatics.

Końskowola

Końskowola is a village in Southeastern Poland. It is the capital of a separate commune within Puławy County and the Lublin Voivodeship. It has 2,188 inhabitants (as of 2004).

The town was established on June 8, 1532. Końskowola served as a center of the foodstuffs trade for the surrounding area. Several textile production factories were also located there. 
During World War II, on September 15, 1939, Końskowola was taken by German troops and occupied. During the course of WWII, the Germans set up a POW camp and camps for slave labor in the town. The POW camp was soon stopped, but a labor camp continued in operation through 1943. 

A ghetto was established in the town, to which many groups of Jews were relocated, including Jews from Slovakia. On May 8, 1942, the Nazis conducted an "Aktion" in which many Jews were rounded up and transported to a death camp. In October 1942, the ghetto's population was killed in a massacre carried out by German troops. Some 800-1000 Jews, among them women and children, were taken to a nearby forest and killed. The ghetto's remaining inhabitants were moved to another camp.

With the approach of Soviet Union forces in the summer of 1944, the Germans had plans to burn the town. On July 25, 1944, the German occupation forces were attacked by fighters of the Polish resistance. The town was soon freed from the Germans.

Erich Maria Remarque

Erich Maria Remarque (22 June 1898–25 September 1970) was the pseudonym of Erich Paul Remark, a German author. 

Erich Paul Remark was born in Osnabrück. His parents were of the working-class. The family was Roman Catholic. When he was eighteen, he had to go to war. The Army sent him the front lines of World War I. He was wounded there, by stray shell fragments. After the war, he changed his last name to "Remarque". This had been the family-name until his grandfather's time. He worked at a number of different jobs. He also took the jobs of librarian, businessman, teacher, journalist and editor, at some time.

In 1929, Remarque published his most famous work, "All Quiet on the Western Front" ("Im Westen nichts Neues") under the name "Erich Maria Remarque". He Changed his middle name to honour his mother. The novel described the utter cruelty of the war from the perspective of a twenty-year-old soldier. A number of similar works followed; in simple, emotive language they realistically described wartime and the postwar years. An opposite view is found in "Storm of Steel" ("In Stahlgewittern") by Ernst Jünger. 

In 1933, the Nazis banned and burned Remarque's works. They made propaganda materials. In the materials, they said that he was a descendant of French Jews and that his real last name was Kramer, his original name spelled backwards. This is still listed in some biographies despite the complete lack of proof. He had been living in Switzerland since 1931, and in 1939 he emigrated to the United States of America with his first wife, Ilsa Jeanne Zamboui, whom he married and divorced twice, and they became naturalized citizens of the United States in 1947. In 1948 he went to Switzerland, where he spent the rest of his life. He married the Hollywood actress Paulette Goddard in 1958. He was married to her until his death in 1970, at age 72. He is buried in the Ronco cemetery in Ronco, Ticino, Switzerland. Goddard is also buried there Goddard left $20m to New York University to fund an institute for European study which is named after Remarque.



His books have been translated into at least 58 languages.

James Rodney "J. R." Richard (born March 7, 1950) is a former Major League Baseball starting pitcher for the Houston Astros. Richard was excellent in basketball and baseball in high school. He was drafted by the Houston Astros in the first round of the 1969 amateur draft. He made his baseball debut on September 5, 1971, and pitched a complete game and had fifteen strikeouts. After that, he was one of the top pitchers in the National League, and in all of baseball. He led the league in many pitching categories. They include strikeouts, earned run average (ERA) and hits allowed per nine innings.

On July 30, 1980, Richard suffered a stroke and collapsed while playing catch before a game. He was sent to Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas and had emergency surgery. The surgery removed a dangerous blood clot in his neck. The next year, Richard tried to make a comeback into baseball, but the stroke had slowed down his reaction time and vision. He then spent the next few seasons in minor league baseball. He was later released by the Astros on April 27, 1984. After baseball, Richard was involved in business. He had a few bad business deals and went through two divorces. This left him homeless in 1994. He then found help in a local church, and then became a minister and baseball instructor for young people in Houston.

Shield

A shield is the name used to refer to any object or force used to block something.

The oldest shield known was a device used to block hand weapons and arrows. The shield has been constructed differently over time, even animal hides were used, and the size and weight were largely different as well.

In the Middle ages, Kite shields were commonly used. The Kite shield is a shield in the form of a kite. Because of the lack of mobility due of the kite shields' weight, kite shields were given up for more mobility and two handed weapons. The Buckler was a shield with a round shape. It was commonly used as a replacement for the heavy Kite shields.

Shields were used even after gunpowder weapons. the shield is still used by police and army forces today. Many shields now in days are usually made from advanced material, as well as electronics. Shields also vary from not only hand helds, but clothing, such as vests and, in a way, boots and gloves.

The future of shields have varied from multiple ideas and fiction, usually force fields and energy shields.

Gerbilling is the act of placing a gerbil into the human rectum for stimulation, such as in a sexual fetish. Other small live animals (usually gerbils but also mice, hamsters, rats and various other rodents) are used.

Folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand writes that the urban legend began in 1984, and involved a mouse and an unidentified gay man. In passing years this story changes into a gerbil, and was made to involve to many named male celebrities that were publicly thought to be gay. Rumors surrounding various male celebrities engaging in gerbilling have become popular urban legends over the years.

<doc id="60608" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60608" title="Socialist Party (France)">
Socialist Party (France)

The Socialist Party ("Parti Socialiste", PS) is one of the largest political parties in France. It replaced the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) in 1969.
It is one of the social democratic parties. 

It first won power under the Fifth Republic with François Mitterrand's victory at the 1981 presidential election. 
The party's candidate for the 2007 presidential election, Ségolène Royal, was defeated by Nicolas Sarkozy by about 53% to 47%.

After the failure of the Paris commune (1871), French socialism was figuratively beheaded. Its leaders were killed or exiled. France's first socialist party, the Federation of the Socialist Workers of France ("Fédération des travailleurs socialistes de France" or FTSF), was founded in 1879. 

In 1899, the participation of Millerand in Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau's cabinet caused a debate about socialist participation in a "bourgeois government". Three years later, Jaurès, Allemane and the possibilists founded the French Socialist Party while Guesde and Vaillant formed the Socialist Party of France. Then, in 1905, during the Globe Congress, the two groups merged in the French Section of the Workers International ("Section française de l'Internationale ouvrière" or SFIO). Jaurès became the party leader.

The French socialists were strongly pacifist, but following the assassination of Jaurès in 1914 they were unable to resist the wave of militarism which followed the outbreak of World War I.

The Socialists suffered a severe split over participation in the wartime government of national unity. In 1919 the anti-war socialists were heavily defeated in elections. In 1920, during the Tours Congress, the majority and left wing of the party broke away and formed the French Section of the Communist International ("Section française de l'Internationale Communiste" or SFIC). This party joined the Third International, that was founded by Lenin. The right wing, led by Léon Blum, kept the "old house" and remained in the SFIO. 

In 1934, the Communists changed their line, and the three parties came together in the Popular Front, which won the 1936 elections and brought Blum to power as France's first Socialist Prime Minister. 

After the liberation of France in 1944, the SFIO had a coalition with a powerful Communist Party (which became the main left-wing party) and the Christian Democratic MRP. This alliance did not survive the Cold War. Blum proposed the construction of a Third Force with the center-left and the center-right, against the Gaullists and the Communists. However, his candidate to lead of the SFIO, Daniel Mayer, was defeated by Guy Mollet.

Mollet was supported by the left wing of the party. Paradoxically, he spoke a Marxist language without questioning the alliance with the center and the center-right. He was Prime Minister at the head of a minority government in 1956. The SFIO returned to opposition in 1959. 

The SFIO did not nominate a candidate for the 1965 election. Consequently, it supported the candidacy of François Mitterrand, a former minister of the Fourth Republic who had been a conservative, then an independent of the left. He was resolutely anti-Gaullist. He obtained an honourable result and faced De Gaulle in an unexpected second ballot. He thus appeared as the leader of the non-Communist left.
In order to exist between the Communist Party, leading the left, and the Gaullist Party, leading the country, the SFIO, Radicals, and left wing republican groups created the Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left under Mitterrand's leadership.

In 1969 the SFIO was replaced by the Socialist Party ("Parti socialiste" or PS). It was joined by pro-Pierre Mendès-France clubs (Union of Clubs for the Renewal of the Left led by Alain Savary) and left-wing republican groups (Union of Socialist Groups ad Clubs of Jean Poperen). During the Issy-les-Moulineaux Congress, Alain Savary was elected First Secretary with the support of his predecessor Guy Mollet. He proposed an "ideological dialogue" with the Communists.

Two years later, pro-François Mitterrand clubs (Convention of the Republican institutions), joined the party. Mitterrand defeated the Savary-Mollet duo by proposing an electoral programme with the Communists. 

In 1981 Mitterrand defeated the conservative, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, to become the first socialist elected President of France by universal suffrage. 

The PS lost the majority in the French National Assembly in 1986, forcing Mitterrand to "cohabit" with the conservative government of Jacques Chirac. Nevertheless, Mitterrand was re-elected President in 1988 with a moderate programme entitled "united France". He proposed neither nationalisations nor privatisations. He chose as Prime Minister the most popular and moderate of the Socialist politicians, Michel Rocard. His cabinet included 4 center-right ministers but it was supported by only a plurality in the National Assembly elected in June 1988. 

During his second term, Mitterrand focused on foreign policy and European construction. 

In opposition, the PS reconstructed a coalition with the other left-wing forces: the PCF, the Greens, the Left Radical Party and the MDC. This "Plural Left" ("Gauche plurielle") gained the 1997 legislative election and Jospin became Prime Minister of the third "cohabitation".

His policy was broadly progressive but had little to do with socialism as traditionally understood. The Aubry laws reduced the working time to 35 hours a week. A universal medical cover was instituted. However, the policy of privatization was pursued. 

On April 21, 2002 Jospin was eliminated at the first round of the presidential election. 

In the 2004 regional elections, the Socialists had a major comeback. In coalition with the former "Plural Left", they gained power in 20 of the 22 metropolitan regions (all except Alsace and Corsica) and in the four overseas regions. In fact, it benefited from a "sanction-vote" against the right. 

On December 1, 2004, 59% of the members of the Socialist Party decided to approve the proposed European Constitution. However, several well-known members of the Party, including Laurent Fabius, and left-wingers Henri Emmanuelli and Jean-Luc Mélenchon, asked the voters to vote "no" in the 29 May 2005 French referendum on the European Constitution, at which the proposed Constitution was rejected. 

For the 2007 presidential election, many potential candidates appeared: François Hollande, Laurent Fabius (who has joined the left-wing of the party), Dominique Strauss-Kahn (who claimed he represented "social-democracy"), Jack Lang, Martine Aubry and Ségolène Royal, who was favourite according to the polls. 

On November 16, 2006, the members of the Socialist Party chose Ségolène Royal to be their candidate with a majority of 60%. Her challengers, Strauss-Kahn and Fabius, obtained 21% and 19% respectively.

After obtaining 25% of the vote in the first round of France's presidential elections Ségolène Royal qualified for the second round of voting but lost to Nicolas Sarkozy on May 6, 2007.

<doc id="60610" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60610" title="Anomie">
Anomie

Anomie means a condition when a person has no (or only little) standards or values.

In context with society or government it means social unrest.

The word comes from Greek, namely the prefix "a-" “without”, and "nomos" “law”. The original meaning of "anomie" was "against or outside the law". 

In contemporary English the word "anomie" can mean not only normlessness but also anarchy. Émile Durkheim and later theorists, meant with "anomie" a reaction against or a retreat from the regulatory social controls of society, and is a completely separate concept from anarchy which is an absence of effective rulers or leaders.

In Albert Camus’s existentialist novel "The Stranger", the protagonist Meursault struggles to construct an individual system of values as he responds to the disappearance of the old. He exists largely in a state of "anomie", as seen from the apathy evinced in the opening lines: "“Aujourd’hui, maman est morte. Ou peut-être hier, je ne sais pas”" (“Today Mother died. Or maybe yesterday, I don't know.”) 

Dostoevsky, whose work is often considered a philosophical precursor to existentialism, often expressed a similar concern in his novels. In The Brothers Karamazov, the character Dimitri Karamazov asks his atheist friend Rakitin, ”...without God and immortal life? All things are lawful then, they can do what they like?” Raskolnikov, the anti-hero of Dostoevsky’s novel Crime and Punishment, puts this philosophy into action when he kills an elderly pawnbroker and her sister, later rationalizing this act to himself with the words, “...it wasn’t a human being I killed, it was a principle!”

On Hermann Hesse´s Der Steppenwolf we can also find a very clear picture of anomie. The protagonist affirms that the men of the Dark Ages did not suffer more than those of the Classical Antiquity, and vice-versa. It is rather those who live between two times, those who do not know what to follow, that suffer the most. In this token, a man from the Dark Ages living in the Classical Antiquity, or the opposite, would undergo a gulping sadness and agony.

Fog

Fog is mist when it is very thick. It may appear on land or sea. It usually lowers visibility (makes it hard to see very far). When fog forms at high levels it creates a cloud called stratus. When the air chills, moisture will turn to fog. 

Fog is made up of tiny water droplets or, in very cold conditions, ice crystals. When seen on a high speed camera, (a special camera that takes many frames and can view videos at very low speed) it looks like hundreds of small water droplets moving through the air. These water droplets make up the fog or mist. There are many types of fog, such as evaporation fog, advection fog, radiation fog, and upslope fog. The thickness of fog varies depending on the atmosphere, temperature, weather and location.

1983 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1983 Atlantic hurricane season was the least active Atlantic hurricane season ever recorded. The season officially started on June 1, 1983, and ended on November 30. The seaon had only a total of 4 named storms, which was less than half of the average number of storms in a season. In addition, it was the least active season since ACE recording began in 1950.

The most strongest and deadliest storm of the season was Hurricane Alicia, which hit Texas causing great destruction and killing 21 people directly. The damages it brought totaled up to be $2 billion.

Alicia formed in the north-central part of the Gulf of Mexico on August 15. It traveled west, strengthening into a hurricane. It quickly reached Category 3 strength as it approached the Texas coastline, and made landfall at Galveston, Texas on August 18 at its strongest intensity. The storm then moved northward, its eye passing over Houston. Alicia still kept its tropical characteristics while over land, but eventually becoming extratropical and combining itself with another storm over northern Kansas on September 21.

An African tropical wave crossed the Atlantic Ocean and strengthened into Tropical Storm Barry for a short time just off the east coast of Florida on August 24. Barry weakened to a depression just before it made landfall near Melbourne, Florida, but managed to cross the Florida peninsula and continued west across the Gulf of Mexico. In the central Gulf, it began to restrengthen, and was a minimal Category 1 hurricane when it made landfall in northeastern Mexico. Barry then began to quickly weaken over land at about 1200 UTC August 29 and soon dissipated.

A group of scattered tropical thunderstorms 200 km south of Bermuda, strengthened into the fifth tropical depression of the 1983 season. An Air Force Reconnaissance aircraft found winds of 35 kt (40 mph, 65 km/h) and was named Tropical Storm Chantal. Chantal continued to strengthen and developed into a minimal hurricane with 75 mph (120 km/h) winds on September 11 and maintained that strength until September 13, when it weakened back into a tropical storm.

Chantal travelled northeast over open waters, missing the island of Bermuda, before weakening and being destroyed by a frontal system on September 15. As Chantal never made landfall, no damage or fatalities were reported that was related to the storm. However, Chantal created giant waves that were 30–40 ft (9–12 m) high across the East Coast of the United States.

Tropical Storm Dean was a short-lived storm that began as a subtropical storm which developed between Bermuda and the Bahamas on September 26. The subtropical storm headed north-northeast and became tropical the next day. Gale warnings were issued from North Carolina to New England that were produced by Dean, but the storm turned northwest and made landfall on the eastern shore of Virginia on September 30. The storm died out several hours later. Dean was one of only two tropical storms ever to make landfall in eastern shore of Virginia, the other storm being Tropical Storm Bret from the 1981 season.

Overall damage turned out to be light with only minor beach erosion and flooding along parts of the Virginian coastline.

The table on the right shows the ACE for each storm in the season. ACE means the measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have higher ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 35 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. The 1983 season had a cumulative ACE of 16.86 (17), which is extremely below normal and currently the least active season on record since 1914, which had an ACE rating of 2.53.

Alexandra Fyodorovna

Alexandra Fyodorovna (Russian: Императрица Александра Фёдоровна) (born Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine 6 June 1872 – 17 July 1918) was Empress consort of Nicholas II, the last Tsar of the Russian Empire. She was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. The Russian Orthodox Church canonised her as Saint Alexandra in 2000.

Alexandra is best remembered as the last Tsaritsa of Russia. She is also one of the most famous royal carriers of the haemophilia disease. Her friendship with the Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin was also an important part of her life.

Fedorovna was born Princess Alix Victoria Helena Louise Beatrice in Darmstadt, Hesse and by Rhine. That area was a part of the German Empire at the time. Her father was Grand Duke Louis IV. Her mother was the former Princess Alice, the second daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.

In November of 1878, diptheria swept through Hesse. Alix, her sisters, Irene and May and brother, Ernie were infected by the disease. Her sister, May, died shortly before the end of the month but the others got better. Alix's mother became sick after caring for Ernie when he came down with the disease. Princess Alice died on December 14, 1878. Princess Alix became very close to her maternal grandmother. She was often thought to be Victoria's favourite granddaughter. Because of this, Alix spent many of her early years in the United Kingdom. In 1892 when she was twenty, her father died, and her brother, Ernst Ludwig, became the Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine.

Alix was married relatively late for a princess in those times. She had already refused to marry Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence (the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) even though her family wanted her to marry him. She had, however, already met a relative by marriage, the Tsarevich of Russia. His uncle Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich was married to Alix's sister Elizabeth. At first, Nicholas' father, Tsar Alexander III, told them they could not get married. He later changed his mind as his health began get bad. Alix did not like the need that she had to turn away from her Lutheran faith. The Russian tsaritsa had to be Orthodox. She later changed her mind and in time became a strong convert to the faith. She and Nicholas became engaged in April 1894. Alexander III died in November of that year, and Nicholas became Tsar of Russia at the age of twenty-six. The couple were married 14 November 1894.

The Tsar and Tsaritsa and all of their family, along with several family servants, were executed early in the morning during the night of July 17, 1918, by a detachment of Bolsheviks led by Yakov Yurovsky. Alexandra watched the murder of her husband and two servants before Peter Ermakov killed her with a gun shot to the left side of her head before she could finish making the sign of the cross. Ermakov, in a drunken haze, stabbed her dead body and that of her husband's, shattering both their rib cages.

After the execution of the Romanov family, Alexandra's body, along with Nicholas, their children and some servants who died with them, was stripped and the clothing burnt. At first, the bodies were thrown down a unused mine-shaft, 12 miles north of Yekaterinburg. A short time later they were retrieved. Their faces and bodies were badly damaged so they could not be recognized. All of the bodies except for two of the children were later buried again. The bodies missing are believed to be those of a daughter- Maria or Anastasia- and Alexis. In the early 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, what is believed to be the bodies of most of the family were found and identified.

Rikishi (力士) is a word used to call a professional sumo wrestler. The Japanese characters making up the name mean "strong man", which is a good name as the people who take part in sumo wrestling are very strong and big.

During their careers, the sumo wrestlers live in "stables" kept by a former wrestler. The former sumo wrestler makes sure the new wrestlers who live there live a very strict life.

Edda

Edda or the plural Eddas or Eddur, including "Poetic Edda" (or Older Edda) and "Prose Edda" (or Younger Edda), are two collections of stories about Viking deities. They were made in around 9th to 13th century by Icelandic Christian historians.
Although the Eddur are the most important written records remaining today about Norse mythology, they are not very reliable because Christians hated pagan religions, and they changed the original tales to make the Norse gods and goddesses look silly, lusty, and barbaric.

The term "Edda" most likely refers to Oddi, a place where both Saemund Sigfusson (a cleric who is rumoured author of Older Edda), and Snorri Sturluson (a Christian politician, author of Younger Edda) lived.

Njord

Njord is a god in Norse mythology. He is the father of the twins Freyr and Freyja. His wife was Skadi, a goddess/giantess (Freyr and Freyja's stepmother).

Skadi's father caught Loki, and forced him to lure out the goddess Idun. The gods later killed him and freed Idun. Skadi came to fight the gods, but they did not want to fight her. They allowed her to choose her husband among the gods, but only by looking at their feet. She wanted to choose Baldur, who is the handsomest, but the gorgeous feet she picked belonged to Njord. Because Njord is the god of the sea, waves wash his feet clean and pretty. When Skadi moved to her new husband's home near the sea, she missed her mountain home. So she only spends half her time with her husband. When Skadi is away, Njord is sad, causing storms at the sea.

Njord's realm is Noatun. Freyr and Freyja are said to be born by his own sister. This goddess is maybe Nerthus.

Freyr

Freyr (sometimes written as Frey or Frej), in Norse mythology is a god of prosperity and fertility. His father is Njord, and his twin sister is Freyja. Freyr is one of the most important Norse gods. He was the first god to lose in Ragnarok because he gave up his magical sword to marry a giantess. Surtr, the King of the fire giant, killed Freyr and then burnt all the nine worlds with the same magical sword.

When Freyr snuck in and sit on Odin's throne (on which one can see all things around the world), he saw Gerd, a very pretty giantess. He fell in love, and sent his servant to woo her for him, but Gerd did not agree until Freyr's servant threatened to use Freyr's magical sword to damage her lands. Freyr then gave his sword to his servant as a reward. The sword was said to be able to fight by itself.

Freyr's realm is Alfheim. It is the land of the elves. He is the patron god of Sweden. Statues of Odin, Thor, Freyr, Frigg, and Freyja are often found in ancient temples.

Fire salamander

The Fire Salamander (Salamandra salamandra) is probably the most well-known salamander species in Europe. It is black and has different kinds of yellow spots or stripes. Some salamanders are mostly black while others are mostly yellow. Shades of red and orange may sometimes appear. They either mix with the yellow, or replace it completely. This depends on the subspecies. Fire Salamanders can have a very long life. In the German natural history museum of Alexander Koenig a salamander lived more than 50 years. 

Fire Salamanders live in forests in the hilly parts of southern and central Europe. They prefer deciduous forests. They like to hide in the fallen leaves or mossy tree trunks. They need clean small brooks (small rivers) in their habitat. This is for the development of the larvae. Both on land and in the water, Fire salamanders are hard to notice. 
They spend much of the time hidden beneath stones, wood or other objects. 

Fire Salamanders are active in the evening and the night, but on rainy days they may be active in daytime as well. Their diet consists of insects, spiders, earthworms and slugs. Sometimes, they will eat small vertebrates—for example, newts and young frogs. Small prey will be caught within the range of the vomerine teeth or by the posterior half of the tongue, which sticks to the prey.

Males and females look pretty similar except during the breeding season, when the most conspicuous difference is a swollen gland around the male's vent. This gland produces the spermatophore, which carries a sperm packet at its tip. The courtship happens on land. After the male becomes aware of a potential mate, he confronts her and blocks her path. The male deposits his spermatophore on the ground. Reproduction occurs by means of this spermatophore, which will be taken up by the female. Their gills develop lungs. Neotenic fire salamanders have not been observed.

Salamanders may actively defend themselves once they are grasped by a predator. Besides various antipredator postures, "S. salamandra" adults are able to make strong poisons. These usually act on the nerves of the predator. They are called neurotoxins. One such poison is the alkaloid Samandarin. When the salamander senses danger, it can secrete this through its skin. This alkaloid causes strong muscle convulsions and high-blood pressure combined with hyperventilation in all vertebrates. The poison glands of the Fire salamander are concentrated in certain areas of the body, especially around the head and the dorsal skin surface. The colored portions of the animals skin usually coincide with these glands. Most of these secretions might be effective against bacterial and fungal infections of the epidermis, but some secretions could also be dangerous to human life.

Fire Salamanders are found in most of southern and central Europe. They are most commonly found at altitudes between 400 and 1000 m, only rarely below (in Northern Germany sporadically down to 25 m). However in the Balkans or in Spain they are commonly found in higher altitudes as well.

"Salamandra salamandra" (Linnaeus, 1758)

Several subspecies of the Fire Salamander are recognized. Most notable are the subspecies "fastuosa" and "bernadezi". These two are the only viviparous subspecies – the others are ovoviviparous.


Some former subspecies are today recognized as species due to genetic reasons.

One of the most important contributors to Legalism was Han Fei Zi (韓非子). He said that a ruler must use following tools to govern a state:
1. Fa (Chinese: 法; pinyin: fǎ; literally "law or principle"): The law must be known by everyone. Everybody under the ruler is equal before the law. If you do what law wants you will be rewarded. If you break the law or try to break it, you will be punished.
2. Shu (Chinese: 術; pinyin: shù; literally "method, tactic or art"): These are methods the ruler has to use so that nobody is able to abolish the system.
3. Shi (Chinese: 勢; pinyin: shì; literally "legitimacy, power or charisma"): The position of the ruler is important, not the ruler himself.

Sekhmet

In Egyptian mythology, Sekhmet was the goddess of fire and war. She had the head of a lioness and the body of a woman. In her former life, she was Hathor. She was married to Ptah, the god of healing. They balanced each other. It was believed that her breath created the desert.
Sekhmet had the head of a lioness, and a body of a woman. She was usually depicted with a sun disc on top of her head. Many historians argue if she was from Sudan, since lions were plentiful there. When she was seated, she usually held the ahnk of life, but when she was standing, she held a papyrus scepter, the symbol of Lower Egypt. 

Sekhmet's breath represented a hot desert wind, and her body was the glare of the midday sun. She was created when Hathor came down to earth to take vengeance on man. Sekhmet became the destructive eye of the sun, and a solar goddess, and was named “Eye of Ra.” The ancient Egyptians knew that the sun could bring life, (Hathor), but also death. (Sekhmet). Her name translates as "The Powerful One." Sekhmet used her power destructively and brutally.
People were afraid of Sekhmet because along with her healing and protective powers, she was also a destructive and retaliating. The ancient Egyptians believed that the "Seven Arrows of Sekhmet" would bring bad luck, so they used many charms and spells to protect themselves. The was the "Book of the Last Day of the Year" which they recited over a piece of cloth and wore around their neck at the end of the year. This was considered to be a dangerous time. On the first day of the New Year (Wep Ronpet), people would exchange amulets in the form of Sekhmet to keep the goddess happy.

Sekhmet had an unusual form of worship. She was worshipped evenly with her husband, Ptah, and her son, Nefertem. Her main cult center was in Memphis. Many priests recited complicated prayers, used to avert the rage of Sekhmet. A well-known prayer was called "The Last Day of the Year," and it was chanted while wearing a piece of cloth around one's head. The last day of the year was considered to be a dangerous period for the people, because Sekhmet usually attacked then.

Sekhmet was the Egyptian goddess of war and destruction. She was bloodthirsty, out of control, and the Egyptians thought she represented natural disasters. Her husband, Ptah, and her son, Nefertem were closely worshipped. Sekhmet was known as the lady of life, and the lady of terror. In one myth, Sekhmet terrorized the country of Egypt, crazy and thirsty for blood. Re, the sun god, sent many swift-footed messengers to outsmart the female killing machine. The messengers gathered iron ore from the island of Elephantine, and mixed it with beer to make a red, bloody substance. They spread it over the fields, and Sekhmet in her rage, drank it. She fell back and later turned into Hathor, the goddess of love.

Sekhmet’s main cult center was located in Memphis. When Amenemhat officially moved the capital of Egypt to Itjtawy, her cult center moved too. Her large similarity to Hathor brought the special erection of dual temples where citizens could worship Sekhmet and Hathor. Hundreds of statues were set up during the reign of Amenhotep III. At their bases, they emphasize Sekhmet's savagery and brutal myths.

<doc id="60723" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60723" title="Heterodoxy">
Heterodoxy

Heterodoxy means a position that is not within the standards of orthodoxy or to put it precisely "any opinions or doctrines at variance with an official or orthodox position". As an adjective, "heterodox" is used to describe a subject as "characterized by departure from accepted beliefs or standards" ("status quo"). 

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the term is used to refer to Christian churches not belonging to the Eastern Orthodox communion, but have no positions that are as different from those of Orthodox Christianity to thought to be as false as heresy.

Heterodoxy in the Roman Catholic Church in a similar way means views that differ from strictly orthodox views, but retain sufficient faithfulness to the original doctrine to avoid heresy. 

Many Roman Catholics profess some heterodox views, either on doctrinal or social issues. For example, the orthodox Catholic position on unbaptized infants is that their fate is uncertain, and "the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God" (Catechism of the Catholic Church 1261). A heterodox Catholic might profess the belief that unbaptized infants are offered the option to accept or deny salvation by God at their judgment. The belief is not orthodox, as the Church does not profess a belief as to what happens to unbaptized infants; however, it is also not heresy, as the Church accepts that such a scenario "might" be possible. By contrast, a denial of the doctrine of "Original Sin" (thereby negating the necessity of baptism for children) or Papal Infallibility -- would be labeled heretical.

The term "heterodox" is occasionally used by some Christians to refer to themselves when they are in disagreement with orthodox understandings. The heterodox Christians remain in the tradition and attempt a constructive dialog around issues with which they disagree.

Hourglass Dolphin

The Hourglass Dolphin is small and wide compared to other dolphins. It only lives in the very cold waters of the Antarctic It was hardly ever seen until a drawing was made of it in 1820. Only 6 Hourglass dolphins have been examined by scientists. Boats do not usually go where they live. The average water temperature they live in is 0.1-0.3 degrees Celsius. Their life span is unknown, but probably close to other dolphins of its class, so probably around 27 to 46 years. 

The Hourglass Dolphin is black and white and for this reason was called the "sea cow". On each side there is a white patch that looks a little like an hourglass shape. That is how it got its name. and hence the common name of the dolphin.
An adult is about 1.8 m in length and weighs 90-120 kg. Males are probably smaller and lighter than females, but we do not know for sure.
If you are where it lives in is easy to tell from other dolphins. There is only one other dolphin that is as small in the area.
Hourglass Dolphins usually stay in groups of 5-10. Once a group of 60 was recorded. They like to ride the bow of boats. There are usually Fin Whales with them. It is thought they eat small fish, crustaceans, and squid. They have conical teeth probably used to crack the shells of crustaceans. 

The Hourglass Dolphin stays around the Antarctic. Some have been seen from the south of New Zealand and Chile. We think there are at least 140,000 of them.

Giant salamander

The Giant salamanders (Cryptobranchidae) are large aquatic amphibians. 

They live in brooks and ponds in the eastern United States (the Hellbender), and in China and Japan (Asian Giant Salamander).

Cryptobranchids are large, fat salamanders, with folds of skin along their flanks. These help increase the animal's surface area, allowing them to absorb more oxygen from the water. 

Their metamorphosis from the larval stage is incomplete, so that the adults retain gill slits (although they also have lungs), and lack eyelids. They can reach a size of 2 meters (6 feet 6 inches) in length. 

Chinese Giant Salamanders have lived as long as 75 years in captivity. The Chinese giant salamander eats aquatic insects, fish, frogs and also crabs and shrimps.
They hunt mainly at night, and as they have poor eyesight, use sensory nodes on their head and body to detect tiny changes in water pressure, allowing them to find their prey.

During mating season, these salamanders will travel upstream. After the fertilization of the eggs, the male will guard them for at least six months. At this point, the offspring will live off their noticeable stored fat until they are ready to hunt. Once ready they will hunt as a group rather than individually.

Scientists at Asa Zoo in Japan have recently discovered that the male salamander will spawn with more than one female in his den. Sometimes the male "Den Master" will also allow a second male into the den, but the reason for this is unclear.

Butch Hartman

Elmer Earl "Butch" Hartman IV (Born January 10 1965,Highland Park, Michigan) is an American animator, creator of "The Fairly OddParents" and "Danny Phantom".

Hartman was born in Highland Park, Michigan to Elmer Earl Hartman III and Carol Davis. He received the nickname "Butch" as a youth and continues to use the name professionally as an adult. Hartman spent his childhood in Roseville, Michigan and his teen years in New Baltimore, Michigan.

He graduated from Anchor Bay High School in New Baltimore in 1983. He subsequently attended the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California.

While still attending the California Institute of the Arts, Hartman received the chance to intern as an in-between animator on the Don Bluth film, "An American Tail". Shortly after graduating for the California Institute of the Arts Hartman was hired as a character designer for the animated series "My Little Pony". Instead, they had him working on storyboards (which he had not done before) and as quickly as he was hired, he was fired.

Soon after Hartman found work with Ruby Slash, where he worked on "Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog", "Captain N: The Game Master" and "Gadget Boy & Heather".

He was also a video reference crew for the Disney movie Pocahontas.Later,he became a writer,television director and storyboard artist for several Hanna-Barbera shows, including "Dexter's Laboratory", "Cow and Chicken", and "Johnny Bravo".

After his contract with Hanna-Barbera finished up he went to work with former co-worker Fred Seibert on "Oh,Yeah!Cartoons".

He's also a friend of Seth MacFarlane and worked on MacFarlane's animated short "Zoomates" and "Dan Danger" with Steve Marmel. MacFarlane also has a character on Family Guy named after Hartman named Dr. Hartman.

His biggest success came in 1997, when he created "The Fairly OddParents". (The idea came to him during the drive from Hanna-Barbera to Nickelodeon to pitch an idea to Fred Seibert.) It was originally a series of made for TV shorts on the anthology show,"Oh Yeah!Cartoons". In 2001, Nickelodeon picked it up as a full series. "The Fairly OddParents" became a huge hit, second only in the ratings to "SpongeBob SquarePants". Due to the success of "OddParents", Hartman was asked to create another cartoon for Nickelodeon, (Hartman says the President of Nickelodeon asked him if he had an idea, and before he could say the title he was given a contract.) "Danny Phantom", in 2004. "The Fairly OddParents" ceased production in 2006, but it was announced on Hartman's website on February 2, 2007 that 20 more episodes will be produced. On July 11, 2007, The first new episode of Danny Phantom was aired on the Nicktoons Network. Danny Phantom ended production on August 24, 2007. The 7th Season of The Fairly OddParents aired on February 18, 2008, starting with the 1-hour special Fairly Odd Baby.

Hartman was asked to serve as executive producer and screenwriter of "Doogal", the Americanized dub of the British/French animated film "The Magic Roundabout". Seeing that the movie itself was lacking, Hartman proposed that in addition to dubbing, extra scenes be filmed in live action to fill up empty spaces in the story. While the idea was originally received with praise and was essentially given the okay, budgeting was pulled from it at the last minute and the only changes made were in the dubbing.

The film was then dubbed by The Weinstein Company, and was released on February 24, 2006. However, "Doogal" was poorly received by critics, and did poorly in the box-office, grossing only $7 million dollars and getting 7% on Rotten Tomatoes.

Hartman is currently working on two new projects for Nickelodeon: one, a live-action series and the other, animated. It has also been stated that 20 more episodes of "The Fairly OddParents" are currently under production and if possible, he may decide to go ahead and work on a theatrical feature film "The Fairly OddParents Movie" as well.
His other TV work include voice actor|voicing various characters on the animated series "Family Guy" (the series' creator Seth MacFarlane even named the wacky family doctor Hartman after him), and playing the character Sean Masters on the short-lived series "Generations" in 1991. He was also a recurring character on the popular NBC soap opera "Days of Our Lives" (1988 - 1989; see ).

Hartman currently lives in Bell Canyon, California, with his wife, Julieann, and daughters, Carly and Sophia.

On an edition of "Nick Magazine", Butch Hartman posted FOP looks of "Nicktoons" and other Nick Shows such as "Zoey 101", "SpongeBob SquarePants", "Rugrats", "Drake & Josh",and "".

<doc id="60755" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60755" title="Modes of limited transposition">
Modes of limited transposition

Modes of limited transposition are a kind of musical scale. They were used by the French composer Olivier Messiaen.

Major scales have twelve different transpositions. This means that a major scale can start on any of the twelve notes (C, C#, D, D# etc). There are also twelve different transpositions of the minor scale. Each transposition (“each scale”) is a different combination of notes (in this case: all of them).

A chromatic scale (one which uses every note, i.e. using all white and black notes of a keyboard) only has one transposition. This means that a chromatic scale can start on any note: each time it is the same combination of notes.

Messiaen was fascinated by scales that only had a few (usually two or three) transpositions. For example: the whole tone scale, which rises by a whole tone each time, has two transpositions. It can start, for example, on a C, so that the notes are C, D, E, F#, G#, A#, C. It can start on a C# so that the notes are C#, D#, F, G, A, B, C#. Transposing this up another semitone, starting on D, would give D, E, F#, G#, A#, C, D which is exactly the same combination of notes as the first one (the starting note is not important). The whole-tone scale was used by many composers including Glinka, Liszt and, especially, Debussy. Messiaen called it the "first mode" of transposition.

Messiaen’s "second mode", also called the “octatonic scale”, rises by alternating semitone, tone, semitone, tone etc. Messiaen used this scale a great deal, not just in his tunes but in the chords that he used (i.e. melodically and harmonically.

The "third mode" rises by a pattern of tone, semitone, semitone. It has four transpositions.

The other four modes each have a total of six transpositions.

Messiaen liked these modes because there is no note which sounds like the starting note. All the notes sound equal. He described them as having "the charm of impossibilities."

<doc id="60757" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60757" title="Olivier Messiaen">
Olivier Messiaen

Olivier Messiaen (born Avignon, 10 December 1908; died Clichy, near Paris, 27 April, 1992) was a French composer and organist. He is the most famous French composer of the mid-20th century and one of the most important and original composers of his time. He was a brilliant organist and played the organ at the church of La Trinité in Paris for over 60 years. He wrote music for orchestra, piano and organ, most of which is very difficult to play. He was also a great music teacher who taught several young students who became well-known composers e.g. Pierre Boulez, Yvonne Loriod (who became his second wife), Karlheinz Stockhausen, George Benjamin and Iannis Xenakis.

Messiaen started to compose when he was seven years old. When he was given the score of Debussy’s opera "Pelléas et Mélisande" he could imagine the music in his head and he knew he wanted to be a composer. He went to the Paris Conservatoire when he was 11. His teachers included some famous composers such as Paul Dukas, Maurice Emmanuel, Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupré. He was appointed organist at the church of La Trinité in Paris in 1930, a post he held until his death. 

When World War II broke out Messiaen was made a prisoner of war in 1940. While he was held in a Silesian camp he composed a work which was to become a very famous piece of chamber music: the "Quatuor pour la fin du temps" ("Quartet for the end of time") for piano, violin, cello, and clarinet. He composed for these instruments because they were the instruments available. The piece was first performed by Messiaen and fellow prisoners to an audience of 5000 inmates and prison guards.

When he was free again in 1941 Messiaen became professor of harmony at the Paris Conservatoire. He composed 20 pieces for piano which are called "Vingt regards sur l’enfant Jésus" ("Twenty visions of the child Jesus"). He wrote a book about the way he composed, called "Technique de mon langage musical" ("The Technique of my musical language").

Messiaen soon became famous for his teaching and was invited to teach in other countries such as Germany, Hungary and the United States. He became interested in the rhythms of Greek and Hindu music. 

His first wife died in 1959 and he remarried in 1961. He also became very interested in birdsong and spent a lot of time with his wife in the country with a tape recorder recording birdsong. He imitated the birdsong in his music, especially in piano pieces called "Oiseaux exotiques" ("Exotic birds") and the "Catalogue d’oiseaux" ("Catalogue of birds").

Messiaen wrote a lot of organ music which he performed himself. One very popular work is called "Transports de joie" ("Outburst of joy"). It is one of four pieces called "L'Ascension" (The Ascension). A much longer work, consisting of nine movements, is the "La Nativité du Seigneur" ("The Birth of our Lord"). The last movement of this piece is a toccata called "Dieu parmi nous" ("God among us"). It has become a favourite piece for organists to play at recitals or after Christmas carol services.

Messiaen wrote a long piece for orchestra called the " Turangalîla " Symphony. It was first performed in Boston in 1949 with Bernstein conducting. The French government commissioned a piece called "Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum" ("And we expect the rising of the dead") which was dedicated to people who had died in the two world wars. It was performed in the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris and then in Chartres Cathedral in 1965 in the presence of General Charles de Gaulle. In 1966 Messiaen became professor of composition at the Paris Conservatoire.

His visit to the Grand Canyon inspired him to write a ten-movement orchestral piece called "Des Canyons aux étoiles" ("From the canyons to the stars"), which was first performed in 1974 in New York.

Messiaen had been asked in 1971 to write an opera for the Paris Opéra. At first he did not want to start such a large work, but in 1975 he was persuaded to accept the commission and began work on his "Saint-François d'Assise". It took him several years to compose. It was performed in 1983. Messiaen said that he preferred to call it a “spectacle” instead of an “opera”. 

Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire in 1978. In 1987 he was given the highest rank: the Grand-Croix" of the "Légion d'honneur".

Messiaen was in a lot of pain near the end of his life. He needed operations on his back. He still managed to finish a piece called "Éclairs sur l'au delà", which was first performed by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra six months after the composer's death. Messiaen had also been composing a concerto for four musicians he felt particularly grateful to: his wife Loriod, the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, the oboist Heinz Holliger and the flautist Catherine Cantin. This was nearly finished when Messiaen died, and Yvonne Loriod orchestrated the last movement with advice from George Benjamin.

Messiaen said of himself that he was a “composer and rhythmician”. He meant by this that rhythm was very important in his music. He taught himself all about Greek metres although he did not speak the Greek language. He liked rhythms which use odd numbers. Very often a bar of his music may have one extra semiquaver so that there might be 17 semiquavers in a bar. He studied Hindu rhythms and found ways of changing the rhythms during the music. He was very influenced by the rhythms in Stravinsky’s famous piece "The Rite of Spring".

Messiaen’s harmonies are very individual. He was fascinated by scales which can only be transposed in two or three different ways. He called these scales “modes of limited transposition”.

Messiaen’s music is full of different sounds. He wrote extremely well for large orchestras and for the organ, using different instruments or organ sounds in very original ways, e.g. in "Chronochromie" (1960) for large orchestra and "Méditations sur le mystère de la Sainte Trinité".(1969), a work which uses styles from his earlier period together with birdsong. Messiaen had synesthesia which meant that music often made him think of particular colours. In his orchestra Messiaen often used an instrument called the ondes Martenot which was a kind of electronic keyboard instrument. His sister-in-law Jeanne Loriod was a famous player of the ondes Martenot. Messiaen was also influenced by Indonesian gamelan music. For a short time he experimented with total serialism. 

In some of his later works such as the "La Transfiguration de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ", for choir of 100 voices, seven instrumental soloists and large orchestra, composed in the late 1960s, he used a simpler musical language which has helped it to become very popular. 

Messiaen was a devout Roman Catholic all his life. His religion was a very important influence on his life and music.

<doc id="60789" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60789" title="Plate tectonics">
Plate tectonics

Plate tectonics is a theory of geology. It has been developed to explain large scale motions of the Earth's lithosphere. This theory builds on older ideas of continental drift and seafloor spreading. 

Dissipation of heat from the mantle is the original source of energy driving plate tectonics. Exactly how this works is still a matter of debate. The driving forces of plate motion continue to be active subjects of on-going research.

The outermost part of the Earth's interior is made up of two layers. The lithosphere, above, includes the crust and the rigid uppermost part of the mantle. 

Below the lithosphere is the asthenosphere. Although solid, the asthenosphere can flow like a liquid on long time scales. Large convection currents in the asthenosphere transfer heat to the surface, where plumes of less dense magma break apart the plates at the spreading centers. The deeper mantle below the asthenosphere is more rigid again. This is caused by extremely high pressure.

Ocean lithosphere varies in thickness. Because it is formed at mid-ocean ridges and spreads outwards, it gets thicker as it moves further away from the mid-ocean ridge. Typically, the thickness varies from about thick at mid-ocean ridges to greater than at subduction zones. 

Continental lithosphere is typically about thick, though this also varies considerably between basins, mountain ranges, and stable cratonic interiors of continents. The two types of crust also differ in thickness, with continental crust being considerably thicker than oceanic ( vs. ).
The lithosphere consists of "tectonic plates". There are eight major and many minor plates. The lithospheric plates ride on the asthenosphere. These plates move at one of three types of plate boundaries.

Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along plate boundaries. The lateral movement of the plates varies from:

Tectonic plates can create mountains, earthquakes, volcanoes, mid-oceanic ridges and oceanic trenches, depending on which way the plates are moving.

Depending on how they are defined, there are usually seven or eight major plates:

Lithosphere

The lithosphere is the solid shell of the planet "Earth". That means the crust and the the part of the upper mantle that behaves elastically on time scales of thousands of years or greater. 

Under the lithosphere there is the asthenosphere, the weaker, hotter, and deeper part of the upper mantle. This part can flow. 

The lithosphere provides a conductive lid atop the convecting mantle; as such, it affects heat transport through the Earth.

There are two types of lithosphere:

The lithosphere is divided into tectonic plates, which move gradually relative to one another. 

Oceanic lithosphere thickens as it ages and moves away from the mid-ocean ridge. This thickening occurs by conductive cooling, which converts hot asthenosphere into lithospheric mantle, and causes the oceanic lithosphere to become increasingly dense with age. Oceanic lithosphere is less dense than asthenosphere for a few tens of millions of years, but after this becomes increasingly denser than asthenosphere. 

When a continental plate comes together with an oceanic plate, at subduction zones, the oceanic lithosphere always sinks beneath the continental. 

New oceanic lithosphere is constantly being produced at mid-ocean ridges and is recycled back to the mantle at subduction zones. As a result, oceanic lithosphere is much younger than continental lithosphere: the oldest oceanic lithosphere is about 200 million years old, while parts of the continental lithosphere are billions of years old. 

Another distinguishing characteristic of the lithosphere is its flow properties. Under the influence of the low-intensity, long-term stresses that drive tectonic motion, the lithosphere responds essentially as a rigid shell and thus deforms primarily through brittle failure, whereas the asthenosphere (the layer of the mantle below the lithosphere) is heat-softened and accommodates strain through plastic deformation.

Carlo Airoldi (21 September 1869–18 June 1929) was an Italian marathon runner, famous for walking to the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.

Airoldi was born in Origgio, near Saronno. He competed in sporting contests in the Varese. Later, he competed at the national and international level. In 1892, he won the Lecco-Milano and the Milano-Torino. He became famous very quickly. He was one of the best marathon runners of his time. In September 1895, he won the Milano-Barcellona marathon. He won 2000 pesetas for his victory.

Airoldi wanted to participate in the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. But, he did not have many to get to Athens. He received some money from "La Bicicleta", a popular magazine of the time. Airoldi decided to run his way to Athens. He would need to cover seventy kilometres a day to arrive on time. The magazine covered the stages of his journey. They also provided him with food and water.

Airoldi first went from Milan to Split, with no problems. In the next stage, Airoldi planned to run along the Croatian coast through Kotor and Corfu. However, he fell and hurt his hand during the journey. He had to spend two days resting himself. He was told not to cross Albania on foot. He decided to take an Austrian boat to Patras. Then, he would go to Athens on foot. 

Airoldi finished his 28-day journey to Athens. However, he was not allowed to compete in the marathon. The head of the Olympic committee said that he was a professional athlete, and could not compete. Officials in Italy sent telegrams to the official, but Airoldi was still not allowed to compete. Italians felt that Airoldi was not allowed to compete because Greeks wanted to win the marathon. Airoldi did not accept the final decision. He then challenged the marathon-winner Spiridon Louis to a race. However, Louis never accepted Airoldi's offer.

Back in Italy, Airoldi tried to beat Spiridon Louis's record. He did not succeed. He continued to race in Lombardy and Switzerland. After he finished racing, he moved to South America.

1986 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1986 Atlantic hurricane season officially started on June 1, 1983, and ended on November 30. The season had a total of 6 named storms and 4 hurricanes.

Tropical Depression One formed on June 5 north of the Bahamas. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Andrew the next day. Andrew traveled along the East Coast of the United States, creating giant waves and high surf along the shore but with minor damages. Andrew dissipated south of Cape Cod. One person drowned off the North Carolina coast in high surf, but no major damages was reported.

Tropical Depression Two formed south of the Louisiana coast on June 23 and quickly strengthened into a hurricane. Bonnie made landfall on the upper Texas coast near High Island. Streets were flooded throughout southeast Texas, mobile homes were destroyed, and three people were killed. Bonnie caused $2 million (1986 USD) in damage.

A tropical depression formed off the coast of the Florida and moved inland. The depression then travelled across Florida and exited the coast near Savannah, Georgia, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Charley. Charley continued moving up the coastline, and the storm strengthened into a hurricane before moving across the Outer Banks and Delmarva Peninsula. Charley then moved out into the sea, later became extratropical in the north Atlantic Ocean, and later brought bad weather across the British Isles on August 25 where it caused major damages.

On September 1, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and moved west. The disturbance was below the 10 degree latitude as it developed into a tropical depression on September 7 and then strengthened into a tropical storm later that day. Danielle peaked as a 60 mph storm on September 8, while a Reconnaissance Aircraft reported gusts of up to hurricane force. After passing through the Lesser Antilles, Danielle came across vertical wind shear, and on September 10, it dissipated in the central Caribbean Sea. The remnants of Danielle continued to move west and eventually redeveloped in the Pacific Ocean as Tropical Storm Lester. 

The strongest storm of the season began as a tropical wave off Africa on September 4. After moving across the tropical Atlantic Ocean it strengthened as Tropical Depression Five on September 10 while about 1240 miles (2000 km) east of Puerto Rico. The depression quickly strengthened and reached hurricane strength on September 11; Earl reached its strongest point on September 12, as a Category 2 hurricane as it travelled in a half circle.

The hurricane weakened to a Category 1 on September 16 and bounced back the way it came. Earl then turned north and became extratropical southeast of Newfoundland on September 19. At its strongest point, Earl had sustained winds of 105 mph (170 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 979 mbar.

Tropical Depression Six formed on November 18 and quickly strengthened into a tropical storm. The storm curved northeast and strengthened further, reaching hurricane strength on November 20. However, a high pressure system to the north caused the storm to fall apart. Frances was later destroyed by an extratropical low on November 21.
These were the names set aside to be used in 1986 Atlantic hurricane. In the Atlantic, the names are used again every six years, so many of these names were used in 1980 and again in 1992. The names that did not get used are marked with . 

No names were retired from the 1986 Atlantic hurricane season.

Accra

Accra is the capital city of Ghana. It has a population of about 1,970,400 (2005). The city is Ghana's largest city. It is also the administrative, communications, and economic center of the country. The main economic activities in Accra are financial and government services, communications, construction, transportation and agriculture (mostly fishing). Most of Ghana's ability to make build things is in the capital area. 

Accra was founded by the Ga people in the late 1600s. The word Accra comes from the word "Nkran" meaning ants. This is because of the many anthills seen in the countryside around Accra. During part of its history, Accra was a very important place for trade with the Portuguese. The Portuguese built a fort in the town. Many other countries also built forts at Accra during the 17th century. These countries included Sweden, the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom and Denmark.

The location that is Accra today grew into a large town around the original Ga town. As the city grew, the British, Danish and Dutch forts and the small communities that formed around the forts were made added to the city.

In 1877, at the end of the second Anglo-Asante War, Accra replaced Cape Coast as the capital of the British Gold Coast colony. After a railroad was built between Accra and the inland locations of mines and farms, Accra became the economic center of Ghana. Large areas of the city were destroyed by earthquakes in 1862 and 1939, but the city rebuilt around a seaport and later a brewery. Each time it rebuilt, the city was made larger.

The Accra Riots in 1948 started people in Ghana fighting for independence. This led to the Ghana's independence from the United Kingdom and it becoming a country in 1957.

Today, Accra is one of the richest and most modern cities in the African continent. It has a high quality of living by African standards.

<doc id="60852" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60852" title="César Franck">
César Franck

César Franck (born Liège, 10 December, 1822; died Paris, November 8, 1890), was a composer, organist and music teacher of Belgian and German origin who lived in France. He was one of the great musicians of his time. He was organist at the church of Sainte Clotilde in Paris for more than 30 years and he taught many talented young musicians. Most of the music for which he is famous was composed when he was already quite old.

César Franck was born in Liège, a town which is now in Belgium. His father came from near the German-Belgian border and his mother was German. Because his father wanted him to be a concert pianist, he was sent to study at the conservatoire in Liege before going to the Paris Conservatoire in 1837. In 1842 his father made him come back to Liège so that he could practise for his career as a virtuoso pianist. He went back to Paris in 1844 and stayed there for the rest of his life. He told his father he did not want to be a concert pianist. This made his father very angry.

During his first years in Paris, Franck made his living by teaching and playing the organ. In 1848 he married. His parents came to the wedding although they were still angry with him for not wanting to be a pianist. 

In 1858 he became organist at a new church called Saint Clotilde Basilica. He stayed there for the rest of his life. He decided to improve his organ playing, in particular in the use of pedals and in improvisation. At that time changes were being made in France to the pipe organ. Aristide Cavaillé-Coll was a very famous organ builder. He built an organ for Saint Clotilde Basilica and Franck gave the first recital on the new instrument in December 1859. Franck became famous for the way he improvised on the organ after the services. However, for many years he did not compose much.

Franck was becoming known as a teacher of organ and composition. His group of pupils became known as the "bande à Franck" (the "Franck band"). They included Henri Duparc, who introduced him to Alexis de Castillon. Franck became organ professor at the Paris Conservatoire. The students he taught included Vincent d'Indy, Ernest Chausson, and Louis Vierne. His organ works, especially the "Grande Pièce Symphonique", were some of the best organ pieces to come from France (or anywhere else) in over a century. They helped to prepare for the French symphonic organ style, which was to include many famous composers from the late 19th century onwards: people such as Vierne, Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupré. 

In 1872 he wrote an oratorio "Rédemption". It was not a success when it was first performed, but this was mainly due to the instrumental parts which had been badly copied, and by the famous conductor Edouard Colonne who conducted it very badly. The work became popular years later after Franck had died.

Franck was now starting to compose the works which made him really famous. He wrote a very large oratorio called "Les Béatitudes". Later he wrote a "Piano Quintet" and the symphonic poems "Le chasseur maudit" and "Les Djinns". His piano music included "Prélude, choral et fugue" and the "Variations symphoniques". In 1885 he was awarded the cross of the Legion d’honneur. A year later he became president of the Societe Nationale de Musique. He wrote a "Violin Sonata" (1886) and a "Symphony" (1888), which are probably his two most famous compositions now.

In 1890, Franck was knocked down by a horse tram while crossing the road. He died shortly afterwards, although he still managed to compose his "Trois chorals" for organ just before he died.

Many of Franck's works use "cyclic form", a way of making a long work with several movements sound like one piece by making the main theme or themes come back in later movements. He wrote in a Romantic style which was partly influenced by the music of Wagner and Liszt. Franck had big hands and when he wrote for the piano he often made the pianist play chords with very wide stretches. 

He remains famous for just a small number of compositions written in his last years. One of his best known shorter pieces is the motet "Panis Angelicus", which was originally written for tenor solo, but is more often heard sung by a soprano or treble.

Home directory

In Computing, a home directory is a special directory (or location in the File system, Apple calls directories "folders"). Very often, there is one such home directory per user. Some users, which were created by the system and usually do not log in, do not have such a home directory.

A home directory is used to store personal files of the respective user, including written document and settings for programs.

On Unix and Linux-like operating systems, the directory is usually called like the username. It is usually in the "/home" hierarchy. A user "fred" would therefore his home directory in "/home/fred".

It can be written as "~".

Since Windows 95 there is a directory called "My Documents". It was introduced together with "My Computer". It helps the users locate their files. Since Windows 2000 it is in the user's profile directory "Documents and Settings\username". So a user "fred" will find his files in "Documents and Settings\fred\My Documents". In Windows Vista the directory has lost the "My", and is simply called "Documents". Other directories, which are similar, may exist. They are called "My Music", "My pictures" and "My videos".

In Mac OS X, the home directory is in "/Users".

Mantle (geology)

Earth's mantle is the 1,800 mile (2,900 km) thick shell making up about 84% of Earth's volume. It is over the Earth's iron-rich core, which takes up about 15% of Earth's volume.

Past episodes of melting and volcanism at the outer levels of the mantle have produced a very thin crust of crystallized melt products near the surface, where we live. The gases evolved during the melting of Earth's mantle have a large effect on the composition and size of Earth's atmosphere. 

A thin crust, the upper part of the lithosphere, surrounds the mantle and is about 5 to 75 km thick. There are two main zones in the upper mantle. The uppermost mantle plus overlying crust are relatively rigid and form the lithosphere, an irregular layer with a maximum thickness of perhaps 200 km, of which the uppermost mantle is 120 to 50 km thick.

Below the lithosphere the upper mantle becomes notably more plastic. It is called the asthenosphere, and is composed of flowing rock in the state of plasticity, about 200 km thick, and the lowermost part of the lithosphere, composed of rigid rock, about 50 to 120 km thick. 

The inner mantle is much thicker than the upper mantle. It is under great pressure, and so is thicker (higher viscosity) and flows less easily. 

The chemical composition of the mantle is heavily biased towards three elements: Oxygen 44.8% by weight; Magnesium 22.8%; Silicon 21.5%. Compounds are oxides: silica SiO 46%; magnesium oxide MgO 37.8%.

In 2007 a team of scientists on board the RRS James Cook went to an area of the Atlantic seafloor where the mantle has no crust covering. The anomaly is mid-way between the Cape Verdes Islands and the Caribbean in the Atlantic Ocean, at or near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It is about three kilometres under the ocean surface and covers thousands of square kilometres.

These places are called 'Oceanic Core Complexes' (OCCs), and it is now known that there are more of them.

VRS or Video Relay Service is a service which quickly replaced the TTY for deaf people to make phone calls.

VRS uses a video camera and a high-speed Internet connection, to let people call friends, family, and business associates. People who use VRS can communicate in sign language instead of typing on a keyboard. A deaf or hard of hearing person can use a remote control and call an interpreter. Once the interpreter is on their screen, the caller can call any hearing person and have a phone conversation through the interpreter.

Right now, VRS is only available in the United States. However, only one person has to be in the United States. If the deaf person is in America, they can call anybody in the world. If the deaf person is in another country, they can call anybody in the United States.

The National Assembly of Senegal and Senegal Presidential Palace are in Dakar.

The area that is now Dakar was first settled around the 15th century. In 1444, Portuguese created a colony there. By 1536, the colony was being used to as part of the slave trade. Between 1588 and 1677, the area was fought over by many countries. During this time it was under the control of the Portuguese, Dutch, English, and finally the French.

In 1857, the French built a military base here. This base was called Dakar. It was made the capital of French West Africa in 1902. Dakar was one of the major cities of the French Empire during this time. It was very important in terms of trade, military, and communications to the empire until World War II. 

The city was the capital of the Mali Federation from 1959 to 1960. It then became the capital of Senegal.

IRCAM is housed underneath the Pompidou Centre which is a very large building devoted to the arts, and named after the former French president Georges Pompidou. 

In 1970 Georges Pompidou asked the composer Pierre Boulez to start an institution for music research. Boulez was in put in charge of the institute. It was opened in 1977. Composers were able to work there, composing music, without having to finish pieces by any particular date. They were given plenty of time to experiment. Many modern composers such as Harrison Birtwistle, Jonathan Harvey and George Benjamin have worked there or were influenced by the music that was being composed there. Today musicians working in IRCAM continue to provide many interesting new ideas in electronic music.

Asmara is the capital city of Eritrea. It is the largest settlement in the country. Asmara has a population of about 579,000 people. Textiles and clothing, meat, beer, shoes, and ceramics are the major industrial products of the city.

Asmara grew from four villages founded in the twelfth century. It is said that there were four clans living in the Asmara area. The women of these tribes told them men to join together to fight bandits who had been attacking the area. After they defeated the bandits, a new name was given to the place, "Arbaete Asmara". This name, in the Tigrinya language, meant "the four females united". "Arbaete" was later dropped and the name was made Asmara.

In 1889, Asmara became an Italian colony. It was made the capital of the country in 1897. The city was damaged during earthquakes in 1913 and 1915. During the 1930s, the Italians made many chances to how Asmara looked. Many new buildings were created during this time. This buildings were built in the same style as Italian buildings. This gave Asmara the look of an Italian city. Today many of the buildings and stores in Asmara still have Italian names. 

During World War II, after the defeat of Italy in Africa, Asmara was under British rule. In 1952, the United Nations placed the country and Asmara under Ethiopian control. In the 1960s, the Eritrean people started fighting for independence from Ethiopia. This war lasted until 1991. Asmara was given back to the Eritrean people on May 24, 1991.

The 2002 Atlantic hurricane season was a yearly event of tropical cyclones forming in the Atlantic Ocean. The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30. In total, 12 named storms and 4 hurricanes formed.

Because of an El Nino event happening in the Pacific Ocean, the season ended early on October 16 when the last storm died out. Although most of the season remained quiet, it was very active during the month of September and broke the record of the most number of storms forming in September. The most notable hurricanes were Hurricane Lili which was the strongest and deadliest storm of the season, and Hurricane Isidore which killed a total of 7 people in Louisiana.

Tropical Depression One formed offshore North Carolina. One became Tropical Storm Arthur. Tropical Storm Arthur crossed part of the Atlantic moving northeast. Arthur curved north after moving northeast. Arthur started dying but Arthur made landfall in Newfoundland before completely dying on July 16. 
Bertha formed very quickly into a tropical storm from a tropical depression on August 4. Only two hours after that Bertha made landfall in Boothville, Louisiana. Over Louisiana it weakened to a tropical depression. Bertha went back into the Gulf of Mexico but did not become a tropical storm again. On September 9 Bertha made landfall again near Kingsville, Texas, Bertha died only ten hours later. Bertha left only $200,000 in damage and killed only 1 person. 
Tropical Storm Cristobal was a cyclone that formed in August of 2002. It stayed away from land for most of its life. However, when it died out, what was left of the storm caused rain and wind on Bermuda. It also caused stormy seas that caused three people to drown near Long Island. No severe damage happened. 

Tropical Storm Dolly formed on August 29 as Tropical Depression Four. Four became a Tropical Storm Dolly before dying on September 4. Tropical Storm Dolly did not affect land during her lifetime. 

Edouard formed on September 1 as Tropical Depression Five. Five because a tropical storm. Edouard made a loop and weakened. Edouard made landfall in Ormond Beach, Florida on September 5 as a very weak tropical storm. Edouard died after crossing Florida. No one knows the damage and no one was killed by Edouard. 
On September 5 Tropical Depression Six formed. It moved slowly and became Tropical Storm Fay the next day. On September 7 Fay made landfall near Port O'Connor, Texas. Fay moved over Texas into Mexico and did not completely die until September 11. 

Tropical Depression Seven formed from a tropical wave on September 7. It had a maximum wind speed of 35 mph and a minimum pressure of 1013 mbar. It moved usually west, and was later torn apart by wind shear on September 8. It did not have an effect on land. 
On September 8 Subtropical Depression Eight formed. Eight became a subtropical storm and was named Gustav. After that Gustav became a tropical storm. Tropical Storm Gustav moved very close to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Gustav moved away and became a hurricane on September 11. Gustav then moved very fast and made landfall over Nova Scotia and Newfoundland before Gustav died on September 12. Since Gustav became a hurricane on September 11 it was the latest day ever for a tropical storm to become a hurricane in the Atlantic. Gustav killed 4 people and left $340,000 in damage. 
Tropical Storm Hanna formed in the as Tropical Depression Nine. Nine quickly became Tropical Storm Hanna before making landfall near the border of Mississippi and Alabama on September 14. Hanna left $20 million in damage and killed 3 people. 
Isidore started as Tropical Depression Ten on September 14. Ten crossed Venezuela not long after forming. Because it stay over and near Venezuela Ten fell apart and was not a tropical depression after that. The remains became Tropical Depression Ten again on September 17. The next day Ten became Tropical Storm Isidore. Isidore later on became a hurricane and moved slowly over Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula. The storm made landfall in Louisiana as a tropical storm on September 26. Isidore fell apart again and was last seen on September 27 before it went into a frontal zone in Pennsylvania. Isidore left $1.3 billion in damage and 22 deaths. No one knows the damage in Cuba. 
Tropical Storm Josephine was a weak tropical storm that formed on September 17 as Tropical Depression Eleven. It became a tropical storm later on before it died only two days later, which was September 19. Josephine did not cause damage or kill anyone. 
Hurricane Kyle lasted more than 3 weeks. Hurricane Kyle started as a Subtropical Depression on September 20. It became a subtropical storm, then a tropical storm, and after that, a hurricane. It weakened back to a tropical storm and down to a tropical depression. It became a tropical storm again and made a landfall in McClellanville, South Carolina. Kyle made its second and last landfall in Long Beach, North Carolina on the same day. Kyle left only $5 million in damage and killed only 1 person. 
Hurricane Lili formed on September 21 as Tropical Depression Thirteen. It became a tropical storm on September 23, then it became a tropical wave on September and was not a tropical storm anymore. It reformed and became a tropical depression on September 28. Lili became a tropical storm again and a hurricane on September 30. Lili later made landfall in Cuba and Louisiana. Lili left almost $1 billion in damage and killed 15 people. 

Tropical Depression Fourteen formed from a tropical wave on October 14. It had maximum wind speeds of 35 mph, and a minimum pressure of 1002 mbar. For most of the time, it was predicted to become a tropical storm, and to go up through the Bahamas. However, strong wind shear from the northeast did not allow development, and after making landfall in southern Cuba on October 16, it was destroyed by a cold front. Although it created heavy rains, there was no damage. 
This is the list of names that were set aside for the Atlantic in 2002. Names that were not used are marked in .

After the season the names Isidore and Lili were retired. In 2008 Ike and Laura were used instead.

Alpine Newt

The Alpine Newt ("Triturus alpestris") is an amphibian. It is a Salamander (Urodela or Caudata). The alpine newt is one of five newts in Germany.

Early in the year, Alpine Newts mate. During that time, the males have a blue color on their backs. Their sides have black and white stripes. Their belly has a blue stripe. 
During the mating season early in the year, the males exhibit blue colouring on their backs; their flanks are stippled black and white, and on the belly are marked with a blue stripe. Their crest has yellow and black spots.
The females are more camouflaged. They are a kind of grey (sometimes brown, sometimes green), with less visible spots on the back.

The belly side of both sexes is bright orange to vermilion and always unmarked. The biggest of the males can reach up to nine, and the females up to twelve centimeters in length. After the mating season, older specimens have a darker, almost black, velvety skin (land camouflage).

The Alpine newt typically lives in forests with good access to water in hilly to mountainous regions. They are mostly absent in forest-poor areas. They often occur in thick deciduous forests, as well as parland and natural gardens. Outside the spawning season, the Alpine Newt is a land animal. During the day it stays in all kinds of undergrowth, but during the mating season in cool water (forest pools, artificial pools). After the adults come out of winter dormancy, the Alpine Newts immediately take themselves to the spawning pools.

The spread of the alpine newt is constricted to Central Europe and parts of mountainous Southern Europe as well as an isolated area on the Iberian Peninsula.

There is also some introduced wild populations in the UK

After a steep decrease in the Alpine Newt population in the 1960s-70s, they have apparently recovered their numbers a little bit. Surveillance in the surrounding area of Cologne (approximately 50m above sea level) pointed particularly toward an increase in alpine newt numbers, whereas the numbers of newts in breeding pools seemed to decline. In home gardens, newts are settling in pools in which there can be a high reproduction rate. If fish are maintained in these ponds, the population even in larger ponds will be completely wiped out. However, a small pool of 150 litres volume had more than 60 Alpine Newt larvae of different sizes contained within it at the beginning of July 2003. They were likely spawned from just one female.

The Alpine Newt has been usually placed into the "Triturus" genus. García-París et al. split the genus Triturus into three, and placed the Alpine Newt into its own genus "Mesotriton". Also the subspecies "T. a. inexpectatus" was elevated to species status. However this split has not been completely accepted yet. Originally 9 subspecies of the Alpine Newt were recognized.

Differential equation

A differential equation is a mathematical equation that involves variables like x or y, as well as the rate at which those variables change. Differential equations are special because the solution of a differential equation is itself a function instead of a number. 

If a differential equation only involves x and its derivative, the rate at which y changes, then it is called a first order differential equation. A higher-order differential equation has derivatives of other derivatives. If there are more variables than just x and y, then it is said to be a partial differential equation. Sometimes, something in the world will obey several differential equations at the same time. These are said to be modeled by coupled differential equations.

Some differential equations can be solved exactly, and some cannot. Sometimes one can only be estimated, and a computer program can do this very fast. Although they may seem overly-complicated to someone who has not studied differential equations before, the people who use differential equations tell us that they would not be able to figure important things out without them. Most scientists and engineers (as well as mathematicians) take at least one course in differential equations while in college. Some mathematicians devote their career to investigating differential equations that are difficult to solve.

Differential equations are used in many fields of science since they describe real things:

1982 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1982 Atlantic hurricane season was a yearly event of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean. The season officially started on June 1, 1982, and ended on November 30, 1982. Six named storms formed during the season, along with 2 hurricanes.

While most of the storms were usually weak, the most deadliest storm of the season was Tropical Storm Beryl which killed 115 people while moving across the Caribbean Sea.

A tropical depression formed off western Cuba on June 1 from an group of organized thunderstorms. It moved slowly northeastward through the Gulf of Mexico, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Alberto on June 3. Alberto travelled usually northeast on an unpredictable course and for a hort time, strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane, one of the earliest hurricanes of June. Alberto then quickly weakened back into a tropical storm, moved back to the west, and died near the Florida Keys, Florida, on June 6.

Though the storm never made landfall, Alberto killed 23 people in Cuba from heavy flooding. Southern Florida saw fair rainfall, with a maximum of 16.47 inches occurring in Tavernier. 

The first subtropical storm of the season formed in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico on June 18, and took an almost straight path to the northeast for its whole life. It crossed the Florida peninsula that night, causing an issue of several severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings. The storm continued, crossing the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and kept its strength until June 20 when it became extratropical near Newfoundland.

Subtropical Storm One caused three deaths in Florida, sank a fishing ship off the coast of North Carolina, and caused $10 million in damage (1982 USD, $20 million 2005 USD). 

Beryl became a tropical storm on August 28 while southeast of the Cape Verde islands. The tropical storm travelled slowly west-northwest, while once coming close to hurricane strength. While midway across the Atlantic on September 2, it weakened to a tropical depression. The depression continued west until its circulation collapsed on September 6, just north of the Windward Islands. Beryl killed 115 people in the Cape Verde islands. Though the Cape Verde islands are usually not affected by hurricanes, another tropical storm, Fran, hit the islands in 1984, killing 31 people. 

A non-tropical low formed on September 8 in the Gulf of Mexico. It moved west, and the next day it became into a subtropical depression. Under the control of another low pressure system, the depression turned north, and after slowly becoming better organized it strengthened into Tropical Storm Chris on September 10. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) before moving onto land near Sabine Pass in Louisiana. Chris continued to move inland until it died over central Arkansas on September 13.

Just before Chris made landfall, as many as 6,500 people moved out from southern Louisiana, while many oil workers moved inland. Chris caused a total of $2 million (1982 USD) in damages.

Debby began as a tropical wave that collapsed shortly after leaving the coast of Africa. The wave travelled across the Atlantic, and became a tropical depression off the northern coast of Haiti on September 13. The depression turned north and strengthened into a tropical storm and then a hurricane. Hurricane Debby moved north-northeast, affecting Bermuda with tropical storm-force winds. It continued strengthening as it moved north, peaking at 135 mph (220 km/h). Tropical storm-force winds were also recorded at Cape Race in Newfoundland when Debby passed by on September 18. The storm began to speed up and weaken over the colder waters of the north Atlantic. Debby combined itself with a strong non-tropical system over the British Isles on September 20.

The tropical disturbance that eventually formed Debby dropped heavy rainfall across Puerto Rico, peaking at 12.86 inches in the southwestern part of the island. Debby was known to cause only minor damages that was related to the storm.

A tropical wave formed off the coast of Africa on September 23. The westeren part of the wave grew bigger and was called as Tropical Depression Six on September 30. The depression strengthened, and made a sharp turn on October 1. An Air Force plane found 40 mph winds with a pressure of 1003 mbar and the depression was given the name Ernesto. A second Air Force plane on October 2 found 70 mph winds with a pressure of 997 mbar. By October 3, Ernesto was no longer recognized after combining itself with an extratropical low. Ernesto never came near land and caused no damages.

Bloemfontein

Bloemfontein is one of the three capital cites of South Africa. It is the judicial capital of South Africa, as the Supreme Court is located there. In Afrikaans and Dutch, Bloemfontein means "Spring of Bloem (Bloom}". It is also known as the city of roses. There are a lot of flowers in Bloemfontein.

Bloemfontein was founded by Major H. Douglas Warden in 1846. It was created as both a fort and a place to live. It became the center of government of the British-controlled Orange River Sovereignty (1848–54) and of the Orange Free State (later known as just Free State). 

Bloemfontein became the judicial capital of South Africa in 1910. It is a place where the government works. It has a lot of hospitals and schools.

Bloemfontein is located in central South Africa. It is dry in this part of South Africa. There are a few hills around Bloemfontein. Grass mostly grows around Bloemfontein. The summers are hot, and the winters are cool, but it snowed in August 2006.

Much of the economy of the city is based on canned fruit, glass products, furniture, plastics, and railway engineering. The city saw a large economic growth in the mid-20th century because of the Free State goldfields located 160 km (100 mi) northeast of the city. The Orange River project also helped the city grow economically. It is a major source both of hydroelectricity and of water for irrigation and human uses.

The most popular sports in Bloemfontein are football, rugby, and cricket. In 2010, Bloemfontein will host some FIFA World Cup matches, at Free State Stadium.

Leavened dough, made from dry, ground grains mixed with water and yeast, is used all over the world. It includes all kinds of breads made from wheat, maize, rice and other grains or similar crops used today in the world.

Fried dough foods are common in many cultures. In the United States, "elephant ears" is a common name for fried dough.

In slang, dough is money.

Cupcake

A cupcake (or fairy cake) is a small cake made to serve one person, usually made in a small paper cup container. As with larger cakes, icing and other decorations, such as sprinkles, are often put on them.

Cupcakes are often served during a party, such as children's classroom birthday parties. They are easier to serve than cake because they do not require plates, utensils, or dividing into pieces because they are small. Cupcakes were first invented in the early 1800s.

A simple cupcake uses the same ingredients as most other standard cakes – using butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. The cupcake appeared in 1828 it wasn't invented by any specific person they did it to use up extra batter. The cupcake was easier because large cakes took a long amount of time to cook in the hearth oven. The dish such as a teacup was usually made of clay.

Shore

A shore or shoreline is the fringe of land at the edge of a large body of water, such as an ocean, sea, or lake.

Shores are influenced by the topography of the surrounding landscape, as well as by erosion caused by water, such as waves. The geological makeup of rock and soil controls the type of shore which is created. Although a beach is a synonym for a shore, the term typically refers to shores which are sandy or pebbly, which can be produced by erosion of sedimentary soils.

A strict definition is the strip of land along a water body that is alternately exposed and covered by waves and tides.

A shore will often have a lighthouse on it to help ships in the sea.

Bleach (manga)

"Bleach" follows the lives of Ichigo Kurosaki, who is a high school student who can see ghosts. A "shinigami" (Soul Reaper or, literally, "death god") named Rukia Kuchiki, meets Ichigo while hunting an evil spirit known as a Hollow. Rukia is wounded during the fight with the spirit and cannot do anything except give her powers to Ichigo. That is how the adventures of Ichigo and Rukia begin. Together they search for Hollows and perform soul burials on souls, cleansing the spirits and sending them to Soul Society. The early parts of the story focus mostly on the characters and their pasts, instead actual job of the "shinigami". As events unfold, the story begins to go deeper into the world of the "shinigami" on the "other side" called Soul Society.

The "Bleach" manga was first released in August of 2001 in Shueisha's "Weekly Shonen Jump" magazine. New Japanese-language chapters are featured weekly in the same magazine. The chapters are complied in seven-to-nine chapter "tankōbon" by Shueisha every few months.

The "Bleach" animated TV series is broadcast on Wednesdays by TV Tokyo in Japan. The first 63 episodes were based on the manga, and the next 46 were original to the anime. Beginning with episode 110, the anime has returned to the manga storyline, yet has parts from the previous 46 filler episodes. There are no plans to stop making the series. Also, two OVAs have been produced and two animated films, "", which was released in Japan on December 16, 2006, and Bleach: The Diamond Dust Rebellion, which was released on December 22, 2007.

VIZ Media has released 26 English-language volumes of the manga in North America, and many scanlation groups release unofficial English translations of new chapters.

Ichigo Kurosaki is a teenager who has always been able to see spirits. The story begins with the sudden appearance of an oddly-dressed stranger in Ichigo's bedroom. This stranger is the "shinigami" Rukia Kuchiki, who is surprised that he can see her. While they are talking a Hollow comes. After Rukia is badly wounded while fighting to protect Ichigo, she decides to transfer half of her powers to Ichigo, hoping to give him a chance to fight the hollow. By accident Ichigo absorbs all of Rukia's powers instead, and he defeats the Hollow easily.

Whyalla, South Australia

Whyalla is a city located on Eyre Peninsula, on the shore of Spencers Gulf, South Australia.

Its main industries are associated with the iron ore mines founded by BHP several KM inland. 

Originally it acted as the port for the export of Iron Ore, then in order to obtain the renewal of the mining lease, BHP was forced by the then government of South Australia to build a blast furnace to smelt the ore into pig iron. This eventually led to the establishment of steel making, and ship building industries, which were very active during the period 1960 - 1980. 

The viability of these industries so far from markets had progressively declined, culminating in closure of many operations and a decline in the local population. At its peak, during the mid 1980's the population was about 35,000 people.

He plays for the New York Rangers and is currently an alternate captain. He was considered very skilled and valuable and he was given the Lester B. Pearson award for the Most Outstanding Player in 2004. 

Naslund began his career in Sweden, playing for Team Modo Hockey. Naslund was still quite young at that time. He played very well and was drafted by the NHL. In 1994, after being drafted by the NHL, he was taken in by the Pittsburgh Penguins. He started his rookie NHL years here. He did not play many games as he was not seen to be a great player at that time. Finally, the manager of the Penguins traded him to the Vancouver Canucks. 

After being traded to the Canucks, Naslund was not used in games. The Vancouver coach thought that he was not very good, so Naslund asked to be traded. But he was not. 
Suddenly, he was put in the lineup and did quite well compared to the rest of the team, which were struggling. In 2000, he was put with Todd Bertuzzi and they scored many goals together. Naslund was now a superstar and in 2004 he reached career highs and the NHL gave him the Lester B. Pearson award. 
But in the 2006-2007 season, he struggled because Bertuzzi was traded away and it was much harder for him to score. But in the playoffs that year, he scored many goals in a short period of time. Naslund promised he would be much better next year. In the 2008 offseason, the Rangers signed Naslund to a two year, $8 million contract. Naslund has spent most of his time with the Rangers playing on the team's first line with Scott Gomez as his center. On May 4, 2009 he announced his retirement from professional hockey.

Pier Gerlofs Donia

Pier Gerlofs Donia, 1480 - 1520. He fought for the independence of Friesland (which is now part of the Netherlands). He was an enormous man and was said to be well over 7 feet tall. Donia was also known as Grutte Pier, which means ""Big Lad"", in Frisian language, or Grote Pier, which means the same in Dutch language. He also was a pirate. This great man fought against the people from Holland, Germany, and the Burgundians. In his biggest battle at sea he captured 28 ships, and he killed all 500 men who had been taken prisoner. "Big Lad" was then called the "Cross of the Dutchman".

According to legend, Pier forced his captives to repeat a shibboleth to show which people were Frisians and who were Dutch and Low Germans:

Or, in English translation:

Those prisoners who could not answer this in proper Frisian had their heads cut off by Donia himself. Pier was also noted for his ability to behead several people with a single blow. This meant he could kill many enemies at the same time during battle, and gave him an excellent advantage over his opponents. His famous fighting skills proved their worth in many battles.

Despite his many successes, Pier could not defeat the Burgundian/Hapsburg armies. He retired disillusioned in 1519. He died peacefully in bed in the Frisian town of Sneek on October 28 in the year 1520. His last words were spoken to his life-time enemy, the count of Nychlenborch. He was asked by the count were he wanted to go after he died, to which Pier replied ""Nea myn Heer ta"" (""To my Lord""). He then passed away. After the "Giant of Kimswerd" (another nickname) died, Friesland never again earned its freedom. It has remained a province of the Netherlands.

He was the uncle of the warrior Wijerd Jelckama.

The first year it took place was 1909. The most recent race was on 4 January 1997. The ice on the canals has to be at least 15 cm thick for the race to take place. It is a very tough race indeed, although some years the race has been tougher than others, depending on the weather conditions. 1963 was a terribly cold winter. That year only one in 100 people who took part managed to finish the race.

Type species

The type system is central to all taxonomy in botany and zoology. The point is to fix each name "to a particular specimen". This is to make clear what is meant by the names. Thus genus and species names are attached to a particular specimen. There is also a written description published in a listed journal, together with an illustration. The idea is that what one person means by the names should be the same as what another person means by the names.

According to a precise set of rules laid down by the ICZN and the ICBN, the scientific name of every taxon is almost always based on one particular specimen, or in some cases specimens. Types are usually physical specimens that are kept in a museum or herbarium research collection. Failing that, an image of an individual of that taxon has sometimes been designated as a type.

So, a type is one particular specimen (or in some cases a group of specimens) of an organism to which the scientific name of that organism is formally attached. In other words, a type is an example that serves to show the defining features of that particular taxon.

A type description must include a diagnosis (typically, a discussion of similarities to and differences from closely related species), and an indication of where the type specimen or specimens are deposited for examination.

Ecstasy (drug)

MDMA or 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, which is also known as Ecstasy, E, X, or XTC, is a psychoactive drug in the amphetamine class.
MDMA can cause feelings of euphoria (extreme happiness), empathy (closeness to others) and can lessen anxiety. Bad side effects, that often get worse with higher doses and regular use, include insomnia (inability to sleep), jaw clenching and depression. MDMA has been used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder and its use during therapy is currently being investigated all over the world.
In most countries, MDMA is an illegal drug under a United Nations agreement. Possessing, making or selling MDMA in these countries could result in criminal prosecution and a possible prison term. It is one of the most widely used recreational drugs in the world, and is often associated with rave parties and electronic dance music. 

MDMA has many effects on the human body and brain. It makes the brain release the chemicals serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline. During MDMA use the body also makes more of the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin.



All these effects together can make MDMA dangerous to use. The change in body temperature and the urge to dance for hours on end can make users dehydrate if not enough water is drunk during this time (an example of dehydration and hyperthermia). Lots of dancing can also put pressure on the heart; people with existing heart conditions are vulnerable to this. 

Around 1 person dies out of every million that use MDMA. Mostly this is due to overheating and dehydration. However it is possible to drink too much water (called hyponatremia), swelling the brain and causing death. Many people have died from this after taking MDMA. Another factor is the hormone vasopressin, which is released during MDMA use. Vasopressin restricts the body's urge to urinate, which helps to get rid of excess liquid in the body before it becomes a problem.

Ecstasy is illegal in the United States and was called a "Schedule I" drug. Schedule I drugs have no medical value and are highly addictive. Today, some people consider Ecstasy a "Schedule III" drug, because of it can be used in a therapy. Ectstasy has been shown to reduce fear, and would therefore be useful in psychotherapy, for pain relief (in patients with cancer) or for other mild forms of mental illnesses.

Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale

The Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale is a scale that is used to sort tropical cyclones in the Western Hemisphere. It is only used for storms that are stronger than "tropical storms", and become actual hurricanes. The categories into which the scale separates hurricanes are noted by the strength of their maximum sustained wind speeds. The classifications are used mainly for use in measuring the possible damage and flooding a hurricane will create when it makes landfall.

Very recently, the scale was also used to classify subtropical cyclones after a change in the rules made by the National Hurricane Center in 2002.

The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale is used only to describe hurricanes that form in the Atlantic Ocean and northern Pacific Ocean, to the east of the International Date Line. Other areas call their tropical storms "cyclones" and "typhoons", and use their own classification scales.
In Australia hurricanes were called willy-willies.

Pangolin

Pangolins (or scaly anteaters) are mammals which live in Africa and Asia. They have scales on their skin. There are different types of pangolin. Some types live in trees. All pangolins eat ants and termites. They catch their food using their tongues. Pangolins curl up when they feel scared so that their soft belly is hidden from attack. In southern China and other countries people kill pangolins to eat them. Because of this, there are not many pangolins left in some places.
There are seven species of pangolin, 4 of which live in Africa and 3 of which live in Asia. The ones that live in Africa are the cape pangolin, tree pangolin, and giant pangolin, and the three that live in Asia are the Indian pangolin, Malaysian pangolin, and Chinese pangolin.
The pangolin ranges in color from gray to golden brown, and its scales (that are made of keratin) take more part in a color range between tan and golden brown. A pangolin's scales are attached to muscles under the skin, and can be moved to point towards predators. Hair grows between the scales and near the rear of the animal.
Although a pangolin has features of armadillos (long, ant eating tongue and broad tail) and sloths (claws) the pangolin comes in a completely different order from their order (Xenartha) the pangolin actually belongs to the order Pholidota. 
A pangolin's main predators are wild cats and hyenas, that, and humans. Pangolins are primarily hunted for their meat and scales (which seem to have a medicinal value)
Pangolins eat ants and termites. They cannot eat anything else.
A mother pangolins gestation period is between 120 to 180 days. Young pangolin are born with scales, and they harden by the second day the pangling is out of the womb.

Until 1869 all buildings in the city were of wood or rushes. Since the introduction of stone and brick, the whole city has been rebuilt. It now has many notable structures. For example, the royal palaces, the Anglican and Roman Catholic cathedrals, several stone and brick churches, colleges, schools, hospitals, courts of justice and other government buildings.

The city was captured by the French in 1895. Since then, good roads have been built in the city.

It is also called a "suspension point", "points of ellipsis" or "periods of ellipsis". When speaking, it can be referred to as "dot-dot-dot". An ellipsis is sometimes used to show a pause in speech or an unfinished thought. It is often used at the end of a sentence to mean a trailing off into silence (aposiopesis). For example:

An archive is a collection of records. The term is also used for the location in which these records are kept. Archives are made up of records which have been created during the course of an individual or organization's life. In general, an archive consists of records which have been selected for permanent or long-term preservation. Records, which may be in any media, are normally unpublished, unlike books and other publications. Archives may also be generated by large organisations such as corporations and governments. Archives are different from libraries in that archives hold records which are unique. Archives can be described as holding information "by-products" of activities, while libraries hold specifically authored information "products". The word 'archives' is the correct terminology, whereas 'archive' as a noun or a verb is related to computer science. 

A person who works in archives is called an archivist. The study and practice of organizing, preserving, and providing access to information and materials in archives is called archival science.

My-Otome

My-Otome (舞-乙HiME, Mai-Otome) is an anime made by the Sunrise Inc.. This is similar to "My-HiME", as "My-Otome" has the same characters, but even they have different personalities. 

In the future, people live in planet Earl. Machines called nanomachines still keep the technology from the past. Nanomachines are used to give power to Otomes (Girls), who train in a school called Garderobe academy. The Garderobe academy train Otomes to become Meister Otomes (Dancing Star Girls), who protect their Masters - usually royal people of different kingdoms in Earl. 

A woman called Rena Searrs is an Otome, who had lost her powers because of having a baby. She fights to protect her Master, a king from Windbloom, and hangs her necklace to the daughter of the king, floating her away in a casket at a river. 

14 years later, Arika Yumemiya goes to Garderobe to become an Otome like her mother, who she does not know very much about. She enters the school and when she finds many things which disturb her from being an Otome because of her past, she tries to bear it with her cheerfulness. This story is about how Arika will begin to understand the meaning of being an Otome and how she will save the world from the legendary Harmonium's power.

This is the list of My-Otome's fictional words or phrases.

Otomes (Girls) are powerful girls of Earl, a future planet. Otomes are given money for 100 soldiers, because they are as strong as 100 soldiers put together. They train in a school called Garderobe, and when they graduate, they become Meisters (Dancing Star Girls). Otomes can only materialise when their master kisses their earring.

Otomes can also become one of the Five Pillars, who do not need masters to materialise.

When a royal person makes a contract with an otome, he or she becomes the master of the otome. Otomes can only materialise if the Master kisses them. The Master has to share a life with his or her otome, so when the otome dies, the Master dies, and when the Master dies, the otome dies.

The Five Pillars are the five otomes who use the Shinsou, so they do not need a master. 

The Shinsou is a source who makes the Five Pillars materialise. There is only one Shinsou.

A Nanomachine is a machine from the past which puts a Robe inside the otomes' bodies, so that the Robe shows when they materialise. An earring connects to the Nanomachines. But the Nanomachine has a weakness to males semen. This means that if a otome has sex with a male she will not be able to materialise any more, and will stop becoming otomes, because she lost her power.

When a Master kisses an otome's earring, the otome can materialise because the Nanomachine absorbs the heat from the Master's lips, absorbing the Master's power. This is why a Master must share a life with the otome.

Nano means small, so Nanomachine means a machine which puts things into the body's small cells.

A gem is a jewel which the Master and otome can use to make a contract with each other. There are two same gems: one for the Master on his or her ring and one for the otome, for her earring. From then on, the earring on the otomes are kissed by their Masters to materialise.

Materialise

"Material" means an object, and "materialise" means that a hidden object has shown itself. In My-Otome, materialising is when the Robe (Combat Suit) inside the Otomes are released, so that they can fight.

A Slave Monster is an evil robot which is controlled by a Slave Master.

Like a Master, a Slave Master shares a life with its protector. Instead of otomes, they have a Slave Monster and they do not need a contract to materialise them, as Slave Monsters do not materialise. The Slave Master has to call the Slave Monster by using the Slave Crystal and give a pledge to the God of Wisdom, that they believe in his wisdom, and to call out a loyal slave for them. A Slave Master must always listen to the Slave leader, who is John Smith in My-Otome.

A Slave Crystal is a diamond-shaped crystal. To call out a Slave Monster, a Slave Master must put blood into the crystal by pushing his or her thumb to the crystal and pledging.

A Harmonium is a musical instrument which opens up only for a protector, creator or a sword. Inside is a piano which can only be played when all the three conditions stepped onto its staircase. The piano makes the players have anything they desire or want to have.

Osprey

An Osprey is a type of fish-eating bird. They are also called Fishhawks, Seahawks, and Fish Eagles. It is a large bird measuring up to 60 cm (24 in) long from beak to tail. It has dark brown wings.

The Osprey weighs 1.4–2 kg (3.0–4.4 lb) and is 52–60 cm (20–24 in) long with a 150–180 cm (5–6 ft) wingspan (the distance between the right wingtip and left wingtip when they are spread out). The back of the bird is brown and the belly is white. The head is white with a dark stripe across the eyes. The eyes are golden to brown and the beak (the mouth of a bird) is black. The legs and feet are white with black talons (nails of a bird). 

The Osprey has a short tail and long, narrow wings. Males and females look similar, but males are often paler. In flight, the Osprey raises its wings in an arch shape, making it look like a gull.

Scotland is typical Osprey habitat with lots of trees and lakes (called "lochs"). Because of egg thieves and hunting, only two pairs of Ospreys were left there in 1967. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds began to protect the nests. Ospreys have returned every year to the protected nest at Loch Garten. More than 1.5 million people have been to see them. 

The number of Ospreys in Scotland has increased a lot, but the population has been slow to spread. This is because Ospreys often return to breed near to the place where they hatched. This has been proved in scientific studies in the United States of America and Sweden.

<doc id="61327" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61327" title="Thought">
Thought

Thought is the operation of the brain that allows the "owner" of the brain to solve problems that cannot be solved by instinct. While other animals live mostly by instinct, humans use thought as well as instinct to overcome life's challenges. Without ideas, the world would change more slowly and less dramatically, in general. Consider a simple example: beavers build dams, humans build skyscrapers.

Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind, mental events, mental functions, mental properties, consciousness and their relationship to the physical body, particularly the brain. The mind-body problem, i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body, is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind, although there are other issues that have to do with the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the real (solid) body.

The mind-body problem has to do with the explanation of the relationship that exists between minds, or mental processes, and bodily states or processes. The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states/processes, and how—or even if—minds are affected by and can affect the body. 

Our perceptual experiences depend on stimuli which arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in our mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a hat, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties. A related problem is to explain how someone's propositional attitudes (e.g. beliefs and desires) can cause that individual's neurons to fire and his muscles to contract in exactly the correct manner. These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted epistemologists and philosophers of mind from at least the time of René Descartes.

Cotonou

Cotonou is the economy capital of Benin. It is the largest city in that country. The city has a official population of 761,137 people but it is thought that the actual number of people living in the city may be as high as 1.2 million. Many of the government and diplomatic services of Benin are located in Cotonou. Because of this, the city is Benin's de facto capital, even though the official capital is Porto-Novo. 

The city is best known as a major port because of the Autonomous Port of Cotonou. It is also home to an airport and a railway between it and Parakou. Other features of Cotonou include Cotonou Friendship Stadium, Cotonou Cathedral, Cotonou Central Mosque and the 20-hectare Dantokpa Market. The National University of Benin is located in Cotonou. 

The name 'Cotonou' means 'the mouth of the river of death' in the Fon language. At the beginning of the 19th century, Cotonou (then spelled Kotonou) was a small fishing village. The village was a part of the Kingdom of Dahomey. In 1851, the French made a treaty with the Dahomean King Ghezo. It let them build a place to trade at Cotonou. During the reign of Glele (1858-89), who ruled after Ghezo, the area was given to France by a treaty signed on May 19, 1868. In 1883, the French navy was at the city to stop the British from taking over the area. After Glele's death in 1889, his son Behanzin tried to challenge the treaty but he failed.

Stem (music)

Stems can refer to two things in music, relating to music notation and production.

Stems are the lines which extend from the notehead. Stems may point up or down. Different-facing stems indicate the voice for polyphonic music written on the same staff. For single-note melodies, the stems usually point down for notes on the middle line or higher, and up for those below. If the stem points up from a notehead, the stem starts at the right-hand side of the note, but if it points down, it starts from the left. The exception to this rule is when a chord contains a second, in which case the stem runs between the two notes, the higher being placed on the left of the stem and the lower on the right. The length of a stem is usually that of an octave on the staff, going to either an octave higher or lower than the notehead, depending on which way the stem is pointing.

Stems are the individual parts of a mix, separately saved (usually to disc) for the purposes of use in a remix.

São Tomé

São Tomé is the capital city of São Tomé and Príncipe. It is the largest city in the country. The city has a population of 56,166 people. Its name is Portuguese for "Saint Thomas." São Tomé is important as a port. It is located on Ana Chaves Bay in the north east of São Tomé Island.

The city was founded by Portugal in 1485. It is centred on a sixteenth century cathedral. Another early building is Fort São Sebastião. It was built in 1575 and is now the São Tomé National Museum. In 1599, the city as well as the islands were captured by the Dutch for two days and again in 1641 for a year. São Tomé was the colony's capital until 1753. It has been the national capital since 1852. 

São Tomé is known for its role in the forced conversion of Jews during the Inquisition. When King Manuel I of Portugal wanted to force the Jews to convert, he took away their children and had them sent to this remote island.

Features of the town include the Presidential Palace, the Fisherman's Church, and a cinema. The city is also home to two markets, a radio station, a hospital, and an international airport. São Tomé also serves as the center of the island's road and bus networks.

Everglades

The Everglades is a wide and flat tropical river and mangrove swamp in the southern part of Florida near the city of Miami. 

The Everglades are covered by many plants and a lot of animals live in the Everglades. It is the only place in the world that crocodiles and alligators live together.

The Everglades are a National Park, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The Everglades National Park is a national park in the U.S. state of Florida which protects the southern 25 percent of the original Everglades. It is the largest subtropical wilderness in the United States, and is visited on average by one million people each year. 

It is the third-largest national park in the lower 48 states after Death Valley and Yellowstone. It has also been declared an International Biosphere Reserve, a World Heritage Site and a Wetland of International Importance. It is one of only three parks in the world to appear on all three lists. 

Unlike most U.S. national parks, Everglades National Park was created to protect a fragile ecosystem instead of safeguarding a unique geographic feature. The Everglades are wetlands created by a slow-moving river originating in Lake Okeechobee, fed by the Kissimmee River, and flowing southwest at about per day into Florida Bay. The park protects an interconnected network of marshland and forest ecosystems that are maintained by natural forces. Thirty-six species designated as threatened or protected live in the park, including the Florida panther, the American crocodile, and the West Indian manatee. The park protects the largest U.S. wilderness area east of the Mississippi River. It is the most significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds in North America, and contains the largest mangrove ecosystem in the western hemisphere. More than 350 species of birds, 300 species of fresh and saltwater fish, 40 species of mammals, and 50 species of reptiles live within Everglades National Park. All of South Florida's fresh water, which is stored in the Biscayne Aquifer, is recharged in the park. 

Less than 50 percent of the Everglades which existed before drainage remains today. Populations of wading birds dwindled 90 percent from their original numbers between the 1940s and 2000s. The diversion of water to South Florida's still-growing metropolitan areas is the Everglades National Park's number one threat. In the 1950s and 1960s, of canals and levees, 150 gates and spillways, and 16 pumping stations were constructed to direct water toward cities and away from the Everglades. 

Low levels of water leave fish vulnerable to reptiles and birds, and as sawgrass dries it can burn or die off, which in turn kills apple snails and other animals that wading birds feed upon. Populations of birds fluctuate; in 2009, the South Florida Water Management District claimed wading birds across South Florida increased by 335%. However, following three years of higher numbers, "The Miami Herald" reported the same year that populations of wading birds within the park decreased by 29%. 

The west coast of Florida relies on desalinization for its fresh water; the need for water is too great for the land to provide.

Lost (TV series)

Lost was an American television series about airplane crash survivors on a tropical island in the South Pacific. Most episodes showed events in the present combined with stories from a character's past or future. The show was created by J. J. Abrams, Damon Lindelof, and Jeffrey Lieber. It was mostly filmed in Oahu, Hawaii. The first episode was shown on September 22, 2004. Since then, five seasons have been shown on television. The series is made by ABC Studios, Bad Robot Productions and Grass Skirt Productions. It plays on the ABC Network in the United States. Other television networks show the series in other countries. Because of its large cast and the cost of filming in Hawaii, the series was one of the most expensive on television. 

"Lost" had an average of 15.5 million viewers per episode on ABC during its first year. It won many awards including the Emmy Award for outstanding drama series in 2005 and best American import at the British Academy Television Awards also in 2005.

"Lost" ended with its sixth season. The sixth season began in February 2010 and ended in May 2010. 

The episodes of Season 1 were shown on television in the United States starting on September 22, 2004. There were 24 episodes, which were shown on Wednesday nights. After their plane crashes on an island, the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 must work together to stay alive. The survivors find mysterious things including polar bears, an unseen monster, and the other people living on the island, known as the "Others." They also meet a Frenchwoman who has been on the island for 16 years and find a metal hatch (door) buried in the ground. Some of them try to leave the island on a raft.

Season 2 had 23 episodes and were shown in the United States and Canada on Wednesdays starting September 21, 2005. Most of the story is about the conflict between the survivors and the Others. The survivors go down into the hatch door and find a secret, underground building where a man named Desmond has been living for three years. They learn about the DHARMA Initiative, a group of scientists who built the hatch and many other buildings on the island. The characters meet a new group of survivors from the tail end of the crashed airplane. One of the crash survivors betrays the other castaways by working with the Others.

Season 3 had 22 episodes that began airing in the United States and Canada on October 4, 2006 on Wednesdays at 9:00 pm. After a break, the show returned on February 7, 2007 and aired at 10:00 pm. The story continues 67 days after the crash. New crash survivors and Others are introduced. The crash survivors learn about the Others and their history on the island. A war between the Others and the survivors begins, and the survivors make contact with a rescue team.

Season 4 began airing January 31, 2008 and ended on May 29, 2008. When the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike began, only 8 of the planned 16 episodes had been filmed. After the writer's strike was resolved, only 5 of the remaining 8 episodes in season 4 were filmed. In this season, people from a ship called the "Kahana" come to the island. The new characters are not really a rescue team, and they put the crash survivors in danger. Later, six of the survivors escape the island. They become famous and are called the "Oceanic Six." The things they do after going back home are shown as "flashforwards," which are scenes showing the future.

Season 5 was shown in the United States and Canada from January 21, 2009 to May 13, 2009. This season follows two time lines. The first takes place on the island where the remaining survivors time travel through many time periods. The second shows the Oceanic Six trying to return to the island. Later in the season, most of the characters end up on the island in the year 1977. They join up with the DHARMA Initiative, a group of scientists who lived on the island. Some characters return to the island in 2007, where they meet Jacob, the leader of the Others.

Season 6 aired on February 2, 2010. It was the final season and it had 18 episodes. To keep the story a surprise, the producers of the series do not want any preview scenes to be shown before the season starts.

These characters have regular appearances on the show as of the sixth season.

These characters were regular characters at one point of the show and are now no longer shown or shown only in flashbacks.

Western United States

The Western United States—commonly referred to as the American West or simply The West—traditionally refers to the westernmost states of the United States. Since the United States has expanded westward since its founding, the definition of the West has changed over time. The Mississippi River is often referenced as the easternmost possible boundary of the West. The Census Bureau defines the western United States as these 13 states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada,New Mexico,Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.

The "West" had played a large role in American history; the Old West is an important part of America's folklore.

Bangui

Bangui is the capital city of Central African Republic. It is the largest city in the country. The city has a population of 531,763 people. Most of the population of the Central African Republic lives in the western parts of the country, near Bangui. 

The city was founded in 1889 in what was then the French colony Haut-Oubangui ('Upper Ubangi'). The colony was later renamed Oubangui-Chari and made part of French Equatorial Africa. The city grew around the French military post on the Ubangi river. Bangui served as an administration center for the colony and is now the administrative center of the CAR.

Much violence in Bangui came after the March 1981 elections. These elections took place after the French removed Jean-Bedel Bokassa from office and replaced him with David Dacko. People who did not like Dacko attacked Bangui and made Dacko leave the country. Andre Kolingba then formed the Comité Militaire pour le Redressement National. 

About 200 Central African Republic soldiers mutinied in Bangui in May 1996. They wanted back pay and for dictator Patassé to be removed from control of the country. French soldiers in the country stopped them and returned Patassé to power. More than 50 people were killed during this time. 

Bangui is on the northern banks of the Ubangi River. It is just below a series of rapids. The Congolese town of Zongo is on the opposite side of the river from Bangui. The city centre is near the river. It has a large triumphal arch, the Presidential Palace and the central market. North of the city lie rolling hills.

The Central African Republic is just north of the Equator. Because of this, the daily high temperatures rarely fall below the high 80s Fahrenheit. The rainy season lasts from May until October. Bangui, being in the south of the country and closest to the Equator, is slightly hotter and wetter than the northern parts of the country.

Bangui is an administrative, trade, and commercial center. Bangui makes textiles, food products, beer, shoes, and soap. The main exports are cotton, timber, coffee, and sisal. Unemployment in the city was near 23% as of 2001.

Bangui is a river port. It is served by Bangui M'Poko International Airport. The port handles the most of the country's trade with other countries. River ferries sail to Brazzaville and Zongo. Roads connect the city to Cameroon, Chad, and Sudan.

Several periodicals and three daily newspapers publish in Bangui. Other things to see in Bangui include Boganda Museum and Bokassa Palace. 

Bangui is home to the University of Bangui. It was founded in 1970. The University of Bangui is the only non-agricultural college in the Central African Republic.

Hello, Community. 

We have worked hard, and come up with over 15.000 articles in this project. Some are shorter, some longer, but most that survive the first few days have a reason to be here. Of course, some of the articles are generally easier to understand and better written than others; this is directly related to how much editing has been done to them. 

In order to show to the world that some articles are better than others, other Wikipedia projects have developed the idea of "featured article". This idea wants to say exactly what I have written above, that the article is better than others. 

As some of you may know, this is my third posting to that effect. I have come up with a . This list can be by any named editor. There is also a about the first few articles that have a chance of being very good.

So if anyone of you gets bored enough, please tell your opinion, vote for the articles, or tell us about other such articles that you think should be very good. -- 18:56, 28 May 2007 (UTC)


This might be discussed previously, but I think I like to bring it to your attention (again) now. In the other Wikipedias, there is a policy about writing information in a way. However, in Simple English Wikipedia, we face lots of articles which basically contain a translated/simplified text based on what is found on other wikipedias.

Articles being written from scratch do need to cite sources, to show the validity of the content, and to give the reader a way to read more about each aspect of the issue. Articles being imported from another Wikipedia like English Wikipedia, still need to cite their sources for the same reason, and because there is no guarantee what is found on En WP is correct (although sourced.) How would a reader feel if he reads incorrect statements in Diabetes mellitus, which are there only because they were translated from a version of which contained the wrong information (which was fixed later on)?

So all in all, I think we should reinforce the necessity of citing sources, for example by translating the required from En WP. Your comments are appreciated. 18:25, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

Secularism

Secularism, also called Secularity or (adjectives: Secular or non religious) is the idea of something being not religious or not connected to a church. An example in government is, since many countries made it a law to be a part of one religion, the First Amendment was put in the United States Constitution by "founding fathers" like Thomas Jefferson to make sure that religion and government stayed separate ("Separation of Church and State"). This means that anyone can choose to practice or not practice any religion they want, and the government cannot make them be a part of a religion if they do not want to.

Cascade Volcanic Arc

The Cascade Volcanic Arc (also known as the Cascade Volcanoes or the Cascade Arc) is a major range of volcanoes in southwestern British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and in northern California. The arc is central to the Cascade Range, a mountain range in the Pacific Northwest.

It includes about 20 major volcanoes, among a total of over 4,000 separate volcanic vents.

Twelve volcanoes in the arc are over 10,000 ft (3,000 m) in elevation, and the two highest, Mount Rainier and Mount Shasta, exceed 14,000 ft (4,300 m). By volume, the two largest Cascade volcanoes are the broad shields of Medicine Lake Volcano and Newberry Volcano, which are about 145 mi³ (600 km³) and 108 mi³ (450 km³) respectively. Mount Garibaldi and Glacier Peak are the only two Cascade volcanoes that are made exclusively of dacite.

The volcanism in the arc began about 37 million years ago, however, most of the present-day Cascade volcanoes are less than 2,000,000 years old. The most recent major catastrophic eruption in the arc was at Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980.

The major volcanoes within the arc include Mount Silverthrone, Mount Meager, Mount Cayley, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Baker, Glacier Peak, Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, Mount Adams, Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, Three Sisters, Broken Top, Mount Bachelor, Newberry Volcano, Mount Thielsen, Mount Mazama (Crater Lake), Mount McLoughlin, Medicine Lake Volcano, Mount Shasta, Shastina,Mount Tehama and Lassen Peak.

Lint (material)

Lint is a collection of clothing fibers and other materials usually on or around clothing.

Pocket lint is lint in the bottom of pockets. Pocket lint is usually made up of, but not limited to detached fabric, dust and paper scraps. In some contexts, pocket lint may also refer to random items in one's pocket.

Navel lint, also called belly button lint, belly button fluff or navel fluff, is an collection of fluffy fibres in one's navel. 

Many people find that, at the beginning and end of the day, a small lump of fluff has appeared in the navel cavity. People have wondered why this happens for many years. In 2001, Dr. Karl Kruszelnicki of the University of Sydney, Australia, did a survey to find out why this happens. This is what he found out:


Dr. Kruszelnicki was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for Interdisciplinary Research in 2002. The Ig Nobel Prize is given for "achievements that cannot or should not be repeated".

Austrian scientist Georg Steinhauser has also done research on the navel lint.

Subtropical Storm Andrea (2007)

Subtropical Storm Andrea was the first named storm and first subtropical cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. It was made on May 9; three weeks earlier than when the 2007 season was supposed to start. Andrea started from a non-tropical rain weather area off the coast of Daytona Beach, Florida. After staying close to the same area, on May 10, Andrea weakened into a subtropical depression after coming near to dry air and wind shear, and on the next day, the National Hurricane Center stopped looking at the storm and stopped giving out advisories.

The storm made bad surf along the beach areas from Florida to North Carolina. Andrea killed a total of 6 people not in a direct way, and 5 of those deaths happened when Andrea was extratropical before being a subtropical storm.

Andrea was the first tropical storm to form before the official start of the season since Tropical Storm Ana from the 2003 season which formed on April 2003. The storm was also the first named storm to form in the month of May since Tropical Storm Arlene from the 1981 season.

Subtropical Storm Andrea formed out of an area of a kind of strong non-tropical rainy place that slowly moved around the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of South Carolina. After becoming stronger a bit more and having the National Hurricane Center look at the storm closely, it was named "Andrea" on May 9 after the NHC discovered that the system had a closed low-level spinning and looked subtropical.

The storm did little more than stay near the same place before it became weak and turned into a subtropical depression after coming in contact with dry air and wind shear, both things which weaken tropical and subtropical cyclones. Andrea then died out off the coast of Florida on May 11 after collapsing because of bad weather conditions for the storm.

The extratropical system that would later be Andrea created high waves that made the National Weather Service give a High Surf Advisory at the coastlines between Florida and North Carolina. Almost right after the NHC called the storm Andrea, it also gave out Tropical Storm Watches to Florida and Georgia's coast. But the NHC those stopped giving out advisories after Andrea weakened into a depression. Also, a gale warning was given out for much of the South Carolina coastline.

Andrea was known to have killed a total of 6 people, while 5 of the people killed happened before Andrea became a subtropical storm . Also, the storm only made small damages between the Florida and the North Carolina coast.

Force field

A force field is a field of energy that usually blocks something. The force field is common in science fiction and fantasy stories. The ideal of a force field may be from the vector field, thought it resembled the "warding spells", the protective magic that was claimed to be used by shamans from long ago.

The plasma window is a real-live object that resembles the force field, it provides a separation between vacuum and gas. There is only one true ideal of creating a 'force shield': using an electric field to change the way metallic items move, although no power is known to be powerful enough to do this.

<doc id="61525" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61525" title="Plasma window">
Plasma window

A Plasma window is a field of plasma that fills an area of space. It is similar to a force field. The area is created by using magnetism to hold the plasma in place. With current technology, this area of space is quite small. It is in the shape of a flat planes inside a cylinder.

As plasma increases in temperature, it becomes thicker. At a high enough temperature, plasma can is thick enough to separate a vacuum from normal atmosphere. Plasma does not stop radiation, for example lasers, from moving through it. Because of this, scientists can use a plasma window to create an area of vacuum while still letting radiation to move through it. This is needed because certain types of radiation can only be created in a vacuum but scientists need to use the radiation on things that are found in a normal atmosphere.

The Plasma Window was created at Brookhaven National Laboratory by Ady Hershcovitch. It was patented in 1995. Other creations using the same idea as the plasma window include the Plasma Valve.

The Plasma Valve is related to a plasma window. It was created a year after the plasma window. The plasma Valve is a layer of gas inside a special shell. A ring around the shell holds a vacuum. A breach in the ring can be very bad but technology lets scientists shut off the machine in time before anything happens.

A plasma window is usually created at temperatures of 15,000 kelvin. The only limit to the windows size is the amount of energy needed to create it. A window needs 20 kW of energy for every inch in size.

Plasma windows will glow in different colors depending on the gas used to create the plasma.

Plautus

Titus Macchius Plautus wrote plays in Ancient Rome. Many people just call him Plautus. He was probably born in Sarsina (a city in Romagna) around 254 BC. His comedies are among the earliest works of Latin literature that has not been lost. He is also one of the earliest writers of musical theater.

Little is known about Plautus' early life. When Plautus was young, he built stages for plays. He also helped change the scenes. This might be when he started to love the theatre. People noticed that he was a talented actor. He called himself "Macchius" (a clownish character in popular farces), and "Plautus" (a term meaning "flat-footed"). Tradition also says that after some time, he made enough money to start working in the shipping business. He started something, but he was not successful. He then is said to have worked as someone who worked with his hands. He learned about Greek drama — particularly the New Comedy of Menander — in his free time. His studies led to his plays being shown. The plays were first shown between c. 205 BC and 184 BC. Plautus' comedies are mostly adaptations of Greek plays for Roman people. They are usually based on the works of the Greek playwrights.

H. M. Tolliver talks about the state gods of Rome and what their importance was in the Theatre of Plautus. These gods were an important part of the Romans' lives in Plautus’ time - people were supposed to worship them. Tolliver tells us that the gods were not exactly like the gods worshipped today. They were worshipped but also stood as a national symbol. State religion also served as a political tool. If the gods supported a bad leader, the people should too.

Plautus is sometimes accused of teaching the public indifference and mockery of the gods. Any character in his plays could be compared to a god. Whether to honour a character or to mock him, these references were demeaning to the gods. These references to the gods include a character comparing a mortal woman to a god, or saying he would rather be loved by a woman than by the gods. Pyrgopolynices from "Miles Gloriosus" (vs. 1265), in bragging about his long life, says he was born one day later than Jupiter. In "Pseudolus," Jupiter is compared to Ballio the pimp. It is not uncommon, either, for a character to scorn the gods. This can be seen in "Poenulus" and "Rudens".

Usually the only characters that scorn a god are those of low standing, like a pimp. Plautus perhaps does this to further demoralize the characters. Soldiers often bring ridicule among the gods. Young men, meant to represent the upper social class, often make fun of the gods in their remarks. Parasites, pimps, and courtesans often praise the gods with little ceremony. Tolliver argues that drama both reflects and foreshadows social change. It is likely that there was already much skepticism about the gods in Plautus’ time. Plautus did not make up or encourage irreverence to the gods, but used the ideas of his time. The state controlled stage productions, and Plautus’ plays would have been banned, had they been too risky.

Gnaeus Naevius was another Roman playwright of the late third century BC. He wrote tragedies and even founded the fabula praetexta (history plays), in which he dramatized historical events. He fought in the First Punic War and his birth, therefore, is placed around the year 280 B.C.E. His first tragedy took place in 235 B.C.E. Plautus would have been living at the exact time as Naevius, but began writing later. Naevius is most famous for having been imprisoned by the Metelli and the Scipiones — two powerful families of the late third century. Naevius’ imprisonment and eventual exile is a case of state censorship. This fear of censorship may have influenced Plautus’ choice of what he wrote about and how he wrote about it.

While hundreds of plays have been attributed to Plautus' name, the canon consists of 20 surviving plays. To be able to use a more diverse set of characters, he developed what is called a "stock character". He sometimes used typical situations where these characters could be used as well. He always used the same kinds of stock characters, especially if he could amuse the audience. As Walter Juniper wrote, “Everything, including artistic characterization and consistency of characterization, were sacrificed to humor, and character portrayal remained only where it was necessary for the success of the plot and humor to have a "persona" who stayed in character, and where the "persona" by his portrayal contributed to humor.”

For example, in " Miles Gloriosus", the titular “braggart soldier” Pyrgopolynices only shows his vain and immodest side in the first act, while the parasite Artotrogus exaggerates Pyrgopolynices’ achievements. Artotrogus creates more and more ludicrous claims that Pyrgopolynices agrees to without question. These two are perfect examples of the stock characters of the pompous soldier and the desperate parasite that appeared in Plautine comedies. 

In this way, Plautus could greatly simplify complex characters and give the audience what it wanted. “The audience to whose tastes Plautus catered was not interested in the character play,” instead it wanted humor that was easy to understand by many people. Stock setups offered such humor. Plautus used puns, he played with words, or he gave the words another meaning. Usually, the humorous characters in Plautine plays are of low social standing. This helps the comedy overall, because lower-class characters were often taken less seriously, and had to be less careful what they said.

Mount Edziza

Mount Edziza, located 38 km southeast of Telegraph Creek, British Columbia, Canada, is a potentially active volcanic complex in the Stikine Volcanic Belt. It is a shield volcano that began erupting about 10 million years ago with continued activity until about 1,340 years ago.

It is made up of a lot of cinder cones and blocky lava flows that still keep their first forms. This is the second biggest area of volcanic activity in the northern Stikine Volcanic Belt as well as in Canada. The complex includes the Mount Edziza Plateau, a big volcanic plateau (65 kilometers long and 20 kilometers wide) made of mostly basaltic lava flows with four big stratovolcanoes built on top of the plateau.

A lot of eruptions have happened in the last 10,000 years including: Desolation, Mess Lake, Snowshoe lava fields, Kana Cone, Eve Cone, Cinder Cliff, Icefall Cone, Ridge Cone, Williams Cone, and Walkout Creek. Many of the volcanic features in the volcanic complex are protected as part of Mount Edziza Provincal Park one of the bigger provincial parks in British Columbia.

Bobby Robson

Sir Robert (Bobby) William Robson (18 February 1933 31 July 2009) was a former English association footballer and manager. In his playing career he played almost 600 matches and scored over 100 goals. He also played for the England national team. He scored four goals in 20 games for them. 

Robson managed Fulham F.C. and Ipswich Town F.C. He then managed the England national football team for eight years, from 1982 to 1990. He led England to the semi-finals of the World Cup in 1990. He left England to manage football teams in Europe. This included clubs from Holland, Portugal and Spain. Robson came back to England to manage Newcastle United F.C. in 1999.

Robson was diagnosed with lung cancer, which was described as terminal in 2007. He died in 2009.

Robson was born in Sacriston, County Durham, England in 1933. He was the fourth of five brothers. As a young child he often went to St James' Park with his father to watch Newcastle United F.C.

When he was only 15, Robson played football in a local team of boys aged 18. He became an apprentice electrician but still played football. In 1950, the Fulham F.C. manager, Bill Dodgin, Sr., visited Robson's home. He offered Robson a contract to play professional football. Robson signed the contract and moved to London.

Robson made his professional football debut for Fulham F.C. in 1950. He spent six years at the club before moving to West Bromwich Albion for £25,000. He played for Albion for six years in nearly 250 games, scoring over 50 goals. Albion refused his demands for a bigger salary, and he moved back to Fulham. Fulham sold some important players after Robson came back to the team. This led Robson to think he would not win any trophies. He left Fulham in 1967 and joined the Vancouver Royals in Canada as both a player and a manager. However, he had to share the management role with someone else. Robson did not like this and moved back to England in 1968. He started to manage Fulham.

Robson was selected for England while at West Bromwich Albion. He played for England in the 1958 FIFA World Cup and was selected for the 1962 FIFA World Cup. Due to injury in a friendly against Chile, Robson had to withdraw from the squad. In total, he played 20 times for his country.

Robson started his career as a manager at Fulham F.C. The team were relegated in his first season there. Robson was sacked the following season. In 1969 he became manager of Ipswich Town F.C. However he won no major competitions or trophies during his first four years in charge. In 1973 Ipswich won the Texaco Cup.

Over the next nine seasons in the First Division, only once did Ispwich finish lower than the sixth place . This was the 1977–78 season however the club then went on to win the FA Cup, beating Arsenal F.C. 1–0 at Wembley. Three years later, Robson led Ipswich to victory in the UEFA Cup. The club beat Dutch team AZ Alkmaar 5–4 over two games. Robson moved on to manage the England national football team in 1982.

Robson managed the England team 95 times, with 47 victories. In the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, he led the team to the quarter-finals where they lost to Argentina 2–1. Both Argentina goals were scored by Diego Maradona, including the famous "Hand of God" goal. Four years later, in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, Robson led England into the semi-finals. This time they lost to West Germany in a penalty shoot-out. After this World Cup, Robson's contract was not extended by the Football Association.

Robson joined Dutch club P.S.V. Eindhoven in 1990. They won the league in his first two seasons. However, they did not win any European competitions and in 1992 Robson lost his job. Robson joined Portuguese club Sporting Clube de Portugal in July 1992. He led them to third place in the league in his first season. Defeat in Europe meant Robson was sacked once more, in December 1994. He was quickly offered the manager's job by F.C. Porto. He led the team to victory in the Portuguese Cup and they won the league for two seasons in a row. 

In the summer of 1996, Robson became manager at FC Barcelona. In his short time at the club, he signed Ronaldo and led the club to win the Spanish Cup, Spanish Super Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup. The next season Robson took a more administrative position before going back to Holland to manage P.S.V. Eindhoven for one season.

The next year, Robson went back to England to work for the Football Association. Soon after his return, Newcastle United F.C. manager Ruud Gullit quit, and Robson took the manager's job at St James' Park. He managed the club until 2004 without winning any major trophies or competitions.

On 13 January 2006, Steve Staunton was selected as manager of the Republic of Ireland national team. Robson was named in a support role as "International Football Consultant". Because of health problems, Robson left this position on 17 November 2007.

Robson was married to Elsie from 1955 until his death. They have three sons: Andrew, Paul and Mark. 

In 1991, Robson was diagnosed with colorectal cancer, from which he recovered the following year. His ill health affected his work. While at Porto, for example, Robson suffered from malignant melanoma. This meant he missed the first months of the 1995–96 season. He has had many operations including one in 2006 for a brain tumour. 
On 17 October 2006, Robson was given the all-clear. He was set to complete his contract as consultant to the Irish team. In May 2007, he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Robson died of lung cancer on 31 July 2009.

Robson has been in some advertisements, including Carlsberg's "Best Pub Side" television advertisement. He also worked on ITV during the 2002 World Cup and the 2004 European Championship. He also wrote a weekly column for "The Mail on Sunday".

Bobby Robson was given several honours for his contributions to football. In 1990, after his eight years as England manager, he was awarded a CBE. In 2002, he was knighted. Both awards were for services to football. That year he was awarded the freedom of Newcastle upon Tyne. He also received the UEFA President's Award for 'services to football'. He was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2005, Robson was made an Honorary Freeman of Newcastle. Robson said, in his autobiography, it was "the proudest moment of my life".

Robson also won the 1992 Football Writers' Association Tribute Award for an "outstanding contribution to the national game". In 2001 he was awarded the British Sports Writers' Association Pat Besford Trophy for Outstanding Achievement. In 2005, he received a lifetime achievement award from the Sports Coach UK Awards, and was also awarded the Eircom International Personality of the Year in 2006. On 9 December 2007, Robson was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year.

May 2008 saw the 30th anniversary celebrations of Ipswich Town's 1978 FA Cup win. During this, Robson was granted the Freedom of Ipswich by the Lady Mayor. On 8 December 2008, he was given the Freedom of the City of Durham.

Deomyinae

The subfamily Deomyinae consists of four genera of mouse-like rodents. These were placed in the subfamilies Murinae and Dendromurinae until very recently. They are sometimes called Acomyinae, particularly in references that predate the discovery that the link rat, "Deomys ferugineus", is part of the clade. Deomyinae is the older and more appropriate name.

Deomyines share no morphological characteristics that can be used to separate them from other muroids. Subtle aspects of the third upper molar have been suggested, though. This subfamily is united solely on the basis of shared genetic mutations. These conclusions have demonstrated good statistical support using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, as well as DNA-DNA hybridization. 

Because of the lack of physical characteristics that supportthis group, it is very possible that the subfamily as it is currently recognized could grow bigger. Many of the genera currently placed in Murinae or Dendromurinae have never been included in a molecular phylogenetic analysis. There are potential surprises awaiting when they are.

All genera are found in Africa, suggesting the deomyines may have originated there. The spiny mice, "Acomys" spp. are also found in Asia.

There are currently 4 genera and 36 species included in the Deomyinae.

Spiny mouse

The term spiny mouse refers to any species of rodent within the genus Acomys. They are usually called Spiny mice in English. They look like mice of the genus "Mus". Spiny mice are small mammals with bare, scaled tails. Their coats have unusually stiff guard hairs that work the same way as the spines of a hedgehog. These stiff hairs are why they are called the "spiny mouse".

Even though they look like members of the genus "Mus", scientists thhink that the African spiny mice may be more closely related to gerbils than to common mice.

African spiny mice originated in the deserts of Africa. They are often kept as exotic pets in other parts of the world, particularly Western nations such as the United States. In the pet trade, they are commonly called Egyptian spiny mice or, more simply, spiny mice. Though these animals are like pet mice and rats, the tail of a spiny mouse is much more delicate. The spiny mouse should never be picked up by its tail and should be handled with care to avoid a degloving injury.
Because of their desert origin, spiny mice need warm temperatures and should be kept around 80 degrees Farenheit. These animals are very social and should always be housed in groups when possible. As spiny mice are prone to obesity (getting too fat), it is important to provide a big space and a complex environment to encourage exercise. They need constant attention and should NEVER be housed in a cage smaller than 4X4 ft.

Gestation length is between 38 and 42 days. Litters are normally 2 to 3 pups, but females may have up to 6 pups in a single litter. Other females within the social group may help in the birthing process and look after the pups. Pups are born with their eyes open and covered in fur. They will begin to leave the nesting area at about 3 days of age. Pups are weaned around 5 to 6 weeks and reach sexual maturity at about 6 to 9 weeks. A female can become pregnant at any time in the year and may have up to 12 litters in a year. Spiny mice can live for 4 to 5 years.

The underworld is a term used in many religions and mythologies to refer to the place where people believed they would go after they died, or where their souls would go to after they died.

The underworld is most often thought of in relation to Greek mythology. The Ancient Greeks believed that Hades was the God of the underworld. The Romans called him Pluto, a name which meant “The Wealthy One” because there were lots of minerals under the ground. The most famous story about the underworld is the Greek mythological story of Orpheus and Eurydice.

Anglicanism

Anglicanism is the term used for the doctrine, religious belief, faith, system, practice and principles of the Church of England and other Anglican churches. The term at its broadest includes those who have accepted the work of the English Reformation as embodied in the Church of England or in the offshoot Churches which in other countries have adhered, at least substantially, to its doctrines, its organization, and its liturgy."

The term Anglican derives from a Medieval Latin phrase dating to at least 1246 - "ecclesia anglicana" -meaning 'the English Church'. The noun Anglican is used to describe the people, institutions and churches as well as the liturgical traditions and theological concepts developed by the state established Church of England and the Anglican Communion, a theologically broad and often divergent affiliation of thirty-eight provinces that are in communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury.

Pocket gopher

The pocket gophers are burrowing rodents of the family Geomyidae. These are the "true" gophers. Several ground squirrels of the family Sciuridae are often called gophers as well. They are not true gophers,though. The name "Pocket Gopher" on its own is used for a number of subspecies of the family. Pocket gophers, despite being largely a pest, are a symbol of the U.S. state of Minnesota, sometimes called "The Gopher State".

Pocket Gophers are widely distributed in North America, extending into Central America.

Gophers are heavily built, and most are moderately large. They usually weigh a few hundred grams. A few species reach weights approaching 1 kg. Most gophers have brown fur which often closely matches the color of the soil in which they live. Their most characteristic feature is their large cheek pouches. The "pocket" in their name comes from these pouches. These pouches are fur-lined, and can be turned inside out. They extend from the side of the mouth well back onto the shoulders. They have small eyes and a short, hairy tail which they use to feel around tunnels when they walk backwards.

All pocket gophers are burrowers. They are larder hoarders, and their cheek pouches are used for transporting food back to their burrows. Gophers can collect large hoards. Their presence is unambiguously announced by the appearance of mounds of fresh dirt about 20 cm in diameter. These mounds will often appear in vegetable gardens, lawns, or farms, as gophers like moist soil. They also enjoy feeding on vegetables. For this reason, some species are considered agricultural pests. They may also damage trees in forests. Although they will attempt to flee when threatened, they may attack other animals, including cats and humans, and can inflict serious bites with their long, sharp teeth.

There has been much debate among taxonomists about which races of pocket gopher should be recognised as full species, and the following list cannot be regarded as definitive.

There are about 37 species in 6 genera.

Some sources also list a genus "Hypogeomys", with one species, but this genus name is normally used for the Malagasy Giant Rat, which belongs to the family Nesomyidae.

<doc id="61600" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61600" title="Geomyoidea">
Geomyoidea

Geomyoidea is a superfamily of rodents that contains the pocket gophers (Geomyidae), the kangaroo rats and mice (Heteromyidae), and their fossil relatives. 

Although they do not look similar, gophers are joined with kangaroo rats into a common superfamily. This is widely agreed. Overall morphology, the fossil record, sequence analysis, and biogeography all support this relationship.

Modern geomyoids are mostly restricted to North America, but some have extended their range into South America since the Great American Interchange. Fossil taxa are known from throughout Laurasia.

Some authorities consider the geomyoids related to squirrels, beavers, and mountain beavers.

Other authorities consider geomyoids may be related to mice, jerboas, and perhaps dormice.

Heteromyidae

The family of rodents that include kangaroo rats, kangaroo mice and rock pocket mice is the Heteromyidae family. Most heteromyids live in complex burrows in the deserts and grasslands of western North America. Some species within the "Heteromys" and "Liomys" genera are also found in forests and can be found down as far as northern South America. They feed mostly on seeds and other plant parts, which they carry in their cheek pouches to their burrows.

Although they are very different in physical appearance, the closest relatives of the heteromyids are pocket gophers in the Geomyidae family.

Kangaroo mouse

A kangaroo mouse is either one of the two species of jumping mouse (genus Microdipodops) native to the deserts of the Southwestern United States. Most of them can be found in the state of Nevada. The name "kangaroo mouse" refers to the species' extraordinary jumping ability, as well as its habit of bipedal locomotion. The two species are:

Both species of kangaroo mouse live in sandy desert ecosystems. They forage for seeds and vegetation amongst the scrub brush of their native habitat. The Dark Kangaroo Mouse is also known to feed occasionally on insects and carrion. Interestingly, the mouse never drinks water, instead deriving it metabolically from the foods it eats. The kangaroo mouse collects food and maintains large stocks in their burrows. These burrows are excavated to a length of between 3 and 8 feet (1 to 2.5 meters). The burrow, the entrance to which the mouse covers during daylight hours, is also used to raise litters of between 2 and 7 young. The Pale Kangaroo Mouse burrows only in fine sand, while the Dark Kangaroo Mouse prefers fine, gravelly soils but may also burrow in sand or sandy soil. Kangaroo mice are nocturnal, and are most active in the two hours following sunset. They are believed to hibernate during cold weather.

The kangaroo mice are closely related to the kangaroo rats, which belong to the same subfamily, Dipodomyinae.

Silky pocket mouse

Perognathus is a genus of pocket mouse. Like other members of their family they are more closely related to pocket gophers than to true mice.

The silky pocket mice are small animals with soft fur, long tails, and small feet compared to other heteromyids. They have long claws which they use for digging burrows and sifting sandy substrates for seeds. They have also been found to steal seeds from kangaroo rats' dens. They store these seeds in large hairy external cheek pouches. They are nocturnal and are found in arid habitats. They are not true hibernators, but will go into torpor and stay in their burrows for extended periods of time.

Pocket mouse

Chaetodipus is a genus of pocket mouse. Like other members of their family such as pocket mice in the genus "Perognathus", they are more closely related to pocket gophers than to true mice.

Members of this genus range in size from 80-125 mm (head and body) and weigh 15-47 grams (Nowak, 1999). Unlike the silky pocket mice (genus "Perognathus"), most species of the genus "Chaetodipus" have harsh pelage with some bordering on spiny hair. They tend to be found in arid habitats where they feed on seeds, vegetation, and insects (Nowak, 1999). Females give birth to a litter of 2-9 young after a gestation period of just under a month. The longest recorded lifespan is 8 years and 4 months (Nowak, 1999).
Sometimes members of the genus "Chaetodipus" are placed in the genus "Perognathus".

<doc id="61611" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61611" title="Zarbon">
Zarbon

Zarbon (ザーボン, "Zābon") is a character in "Dragonball Z".

Zarbon is a powerful warrior who values beauty and his looks above all else. He first shows up in the Namek saga, and is shown to be one of Frieza's top two henchmen. Little is known about the character other than his pride, and his long history with Vegeta. His long, green braided hair, tiara and earrings might mean he was a high-class prince. He also wears a very long cape as well as leg and arm-warmers. Along with his choice of clothing, he wears the common armor that most of Frieza's men have, including the shoulder pads and a blue scouter. He is very vain and he considers himself to be of high standard. 

Zarbon has the ability to transform into a reptilian beast. With brute strength and ferocity, his second form is much uglier than his first form. Upon transforming, his size increases as well as his muscular build and his skin becomes covered with what appear to be scales, like a reptile. It's clear that he finds this transformation ugly, as it not only offends his general love of beauty but also takes away his attractive form. In essence, he is both a beauty and a beast.

In a speculative storyline written for the made-for-television set before the events of the Dragonball series, Zarbon appears to have acted primarily as Frieza's advisor. It was Zarbon who is shown to have advised Frieza that it would be wise to wipe out the entire Saiyan race before they posed a threat. He is depicted as being beside Frieza as he killed King Vegeta and destroyed Planet Vegeta.

Zarbon is first seen in the anime and manga when he accompanies Lord Frieza and Dodoria to the Planet of Namek in search of the Dragonballs, which Frieza desires so that he can wish for immortality. Zarbon helps in the collection of most of the Dragonballs, mercilessly slaughtering Namekians who seek to keep the Dragonballs hidden. After Vegeta, and the separate group of Gohan, Krillin, and Bulma show up, there are some scuffles that leave Dodoria dead. Zarbon is the only remaining top henchman of Frieza, and is sent to find another Namekian village, but instead comes face to face with Vegeta. Vegeta overpowers him at first, but when Zarbon realizes his life is threatened, he surprises Vegeta by transforming into his significantly more powerful -- and ugly -- form. This allows him to easily beat Vegeta, who he leaves for dead.

After returning to Frieza, he is ordered to go back and retrieve Vegeta because he had hidden a Dragonball. Zarbon does this, bringing Vegeta to Frieza's medics for treatment of his wounds. However, Vegeta soon escapes with Frieza's dragonballs after being healed. Ordered to find the Saiyan Prince or face death himself, Zarbon again sets out in search of Vegeta. This time the Prince finds him, and the two battle while Krillin and Bulma look on. Zarbon eventually transforms, but his power is not enough to defeat a healed Vegeta, and he is killed in the battle.

Zarbon has appeared as a playable character in numerous video games, some of which include "Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi", "Dragon Ball Z: Budokai", and "Ultimate Battle 22". In "Dragon Ball Z: Super Sonic Warriors 2", he is a support-type character.

He is not only a playable character in "Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2" but he has his own storyline (A What-if scenario added to the game to show Zarbon's love for his own beauty) in the main story mode of the game entitled "Beautiful Treachery." Upon hearing of the power of the Dragon Balls, he hatches a plan to steal them and wish for eternal beauty. This plan mainly revolves around forcing Krillin to assist him, killing Dodoria, and distracting Frieza with a surprise visit from his brother, Cooler. He even gets to fight alongside Goku when his plan goes wrong. In the end, the battle between Frieza and Cooler destroys the planet, tragically taking Zarbon, despite the effects of his wish, with it.

In an issue of Beckett Anime, a Beckett magazine publication, Zarbon was voted as one of the top five greatest henchmen of all anime, and was the only character from "Dragon Ball Z" on the list.

Dodoria

Dodoria (ドドリア, "Dodoria") is a character in "Dragonball Z".
Dodoria is a large, round alien warrior, appearing to be overweight by human standards. He has protruding spikes on his arms and head. He also wears the common armor that most of Lord Frieza's men have, including the shoulder pads and a green scouter.

Before the events of Dragon Ball Z, Dodoria was always by Frieza's side along with Zarbon. He witnessed the killing of King Vegeta and the destruction of planet Vegeta. Before the destruction of Planet Vegeta, he and a group of his elites were sent to eradicate Bardock and his team of fighters. He was successful in killing most of the team, but left Bardock alive after using a powerful mouth blast on him. Both Frieza and Zarbon looked down upon him for carelessly leaving him alive.

Dodoria accompanied his master Frieza and his comrade in battle, Zarbon, to the green Planet Namek in search of the Namek Dragonballs. While searching in a village for a Dragonball, Dodoria killed a few villagers, but before he could kill Dende, he was attacked by Krillin and Gohan. He pursued them, but they escaped after Krillin used a blinding attack called Solar Flare. Dodoria then launched an attack over a large area, which lead him to believe that he had killed them. On his way back, he was ambushed by Vegeta who easily overpowered him. Dodoria tried to bargain with Vegeta by telling him the secret of the destruction of Planet Vegeta, but he did not care. Vegeta killed him during his attempted escape. He only cameos again during the movie "Fusion Reborn" and in the Super Android 17 Saga when people from Hell are able to escape. He is killed again both times.In addition he also loses his scouter while searching for Vegeta

Dodoria uses his brute force to overwhelm his opponents. He has the generic powers that many other Dragon Ball characters share, including the ability to throw numerous exceptionally powerful rapid blasts. He can also emit blasts from his mouth as well, most commonly known as mouth blasts. The most noticeable trait that Dodoria has is his ability to throw his weight around. He is extremely fast in spite of his weight. He can perform multiple spins and aerial strikes regardless of his size.

Dodoria has appeared as a playable character in many video games, some of which include "Dragon Ball Z: Budokai", "Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi", and "Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2". He is also in "Dragon Ball Z: Super Sonic Warriors 2" but only as a support-type character.

Frieza

Frieza (フリーザ, "Furīza") is a fictional character in "Dragon Ball Z".

Frieza is one of the strongest aliens in "Dragon Ball Z". He enjoys at invading other planets. Frieza is very mean person who thinks he is very strong. He has destroyed planets, without caring. He will even kill his own servants. Frieza is always trying to get more power. Because of this, he ends up fighting the heroes of "Dragon Ball Z" so he can get the Dragon Balls. The Dragon Balls are magical balls that can grant wishes.

Frieza is what the creator, Akira Toriyama, thought monsters looked like in his childhood.

Frieza's name is a pun on all things relating to the cold, with family members introduced later following his example. As his name ends in a short "a" vowel (rather than the long ""ā"" which usually signifies "er" in kana spellings on English words), the character's name is typically spelled with an "a" at the end (as opposed to "Freezer"). However, during FUNimation's dubbing of "Dragon Ball Z", the English writers went with the spelling of "Frieza". This has led to some conjecture over it: U.S. released video games and the English dub use "Frieza", while the Japanese language subtitles on FUNimation's DVDs and the Viz translation of the manga uses "Freeza."

Frieza spies on Vegeta during his mission on Earth and learns that there are Dragon Balls on Planet Namek. He wants to get them and wish that he would never die, so Frieza uses his soldiers to try and steal the Dragon Balls from the Namekians. After Cui, Dodoria and Zarbon, three of Frieza's soldiers, are beaten by Vegeta, he sends the Ginyu Force, his strongest men, to get the Dragon Balls and destroy the Saiyan enemy. They almost win, but Goku comes to Namek and quickly defeats them. 

While trying to learn how to summon Porunga, the namekian dragon, Frieza is confronted by Nail, the strongest of the Namek warriors. Frieza defeats Nail effortlessly, leaving him to die after discovering that dende has ran to the Z-fighters to tell Krillin and Gohan how to use the dragon balls. Enraged, the great tyrant follows in pursuit of the heroes only to be faced with a much more powerful Vegeta who is now capable of matching Frieza's current strength.

Spurred on by Vegeta, Frieza unveils his second form, allowing him to defeat Vegeta and critically injure Krillin, taunting Gohan with his friend's limp body. Before he can finish them off, Piccolo joins the battle - roughly even in abilities to Frieza, thanks to a splendid fusion with the dying Nail. The heroes are able to regroup, Dende healing them one after another. Frieza himself is seriously wounded for the first time: Krillin is able to chop off a portion of his tail using a Destructo Disk.

Having difficulty contending with Piccolo, Frieza again transformed, unlocking more of his power and enabling him to lay waste to his opponent. Finally he unveiled his true form, stressing that he intended to give his foes the pleasure of observing it before they died. As his first act, Frieza murders Dende, who had been healing the heroes, before brutally beating Vegeta. Just as Frieza was about to slay Vegeta, the healed Goku arrives on the battlefield, ready to fight Frieza. Vegeta, believing (incorrectly) that Goku had finally become a full-fledge Super Saiyan, taunts Frieza, even though, he, Vegeta, is too badly beaten to even stand. Frieza, proud of his past accomplishments, smirks before sending a Death Beam through the Saiyan Prince's heart. Teetering on the brink of death, Vegeta is able to tell the newly-healed Goku of Frieza's genocide of the Saiyan race, imploring him to take revenge on behalf for all Saiyans. As Vegeta finishes his plea to Goku, he dies. Goku, saddened by Vegeta's death, buries him and vows to finish Frieza. Goku and Frieza then spar, with Frieza realizing that his opponent is the son of the Saiyan that gave him such trouble years before. Goku and Frieza are an even match for awhile, until Frieza reveals that he had only been fighting at a mere fraction of his full power. Frieza then increases to 50%, and easily gains the upper hand against Goku, with Goku struggling to keep up.

Goku is eventually able to heavily wound Frieza using a Spirit Bomb, calling on the energies of the entire planet Namek.

Believing the warlord dead, the heroes take the time to relax, not noticing that Frieza had emerged from the blast's crater. Frieza retaliates by mortally wounding Piccolo and murdering Krillin. Already bordering on the edge of his rage, Frieza killing Krillin, pushes Goku over it, his rage exploding, causing Frieza to inadvertently create what he had always feared: A Super Saiyan.

In the ensuing battle, Frieza and Goku trade blows, but as the fight progresses, Frieza's power gradually diminishes with the repeated punishment. In frustration, Frieza sends a Death Ball into the core of the planet, starting a chain reaction that would destroy Namek in "five minutes". Frieza unleashes 100% of his power. Frieza is now able to launch a huge assault against the surprised Goku, who had not expected Frieza's power to be as high as it is. Goku and Frieza face off and eventually after a very long battle, Goku gets the battle under his control, and calls off the fight, claiming it would be pointless to continue; Frieza losing strength rapidly and Goku already having humbled the tyrant. Humiliated, Frieza refuses to relent, attacking Goku with two Tsuibi Kienzan. As Goku dodges the attacks, Frieza ironically becomes distracted long enough to be vivisected by his own attack.

Barely clinging to life but desperate to survive, Frieza begs and begs for mercy, which Goku hesitantly provides. Frieza's arrogance refuses to allow him to be beaten and saved by a Saiyan "monkey", and he expends what little energy he has left to attack Goku. Overcome with anger, Goku fires a Ki blast that consumes both Frieza and his attack, seemingly ending Frieza's reign over the universe.
Unbeknownst to Goku, Frieza survived the destruction of Namek. Able to do nothing more than breathe, Frieza floated in the planet's debris, kept company only by his thoughts of how the universe's conqueror had been thoroughly beaten by a Saiyan. His father, King Cold, had crews search the area, not believing his son to have been killed by something as insignificant as the explosion of a planet. What could be found of Frieza was salvaged, his missing limbs and face reconstructed with cybernetic enhancements. Scarred and bitter - though feeling stronger than he had before. Frieza's first thought upon rehabilitation is revenge on those who sullied him.

Frieza beats Goku to Earth. Despite his ill intentions towards Earth and all who lived there, Frieza notes "It's a good planet" on first viewing "(Dragon Ball #330)". </ref> Frieza orders his henchmen to find and slaughter its inhabitants, with Frieza keen on killing his enemy's friends himself. However, his army is torn apart by the blade-wielding fighter Future Trunks. Frieza dismisses his challenger as an insolent child, and pays him almost no heed until the boy reveals himself as another Super Saiyan.

Dumbstruck, Frieza makes several different efforts to kill Trunks, each of which is parried easily. He then plays his trump card in the form of a Death Ball ten times the size of the one that destroyed Planet Namek. Even this is nonchalantly brushed away, until a mortified Frieza causes it to detonate with another shot of "ki". Thinking him to be destroyed by the assault, both the father and son are stunned when Trunks fires the Burning Attack out of nowhere. Fuming, Frieza becomes oblivious to his opponent's position, and is surprised and sliced in half by the Saiyan youth before being cut to pieces and blown to dust.

After his death, Frieza makes numerous cameo appearances throughout the remainder of the series from Hell, including observing Goku's fight with Buu alongside other defeated villains from the series.

In "Dragon Ball GT", he teams up with Cell to act as a distraction for Goku while a horde of villains from the Z-Fighters' past escape Hell. Frieza traps Goku in the next world, but even allied with Cell, he is eventually defeated and remains in Hell.
Over time, Frieza's power became so great that his body could not comfortably contain it, and a series of physical transformations were developed that limit his actual strength While changing shape from his "first-form", each alteration builds on the previous. In all, Frieza demonstrated four transformed states, each with increasing power (some larger than others and each resulting in different physical attributes).

In his first form, Frieza is a relatively short humanoid, albeit with a large chestnut-shaped skull with two horns. He also has a tail with a spiked end, as well as having three talon-like toes. He wears the same upper-body armor that many of his subordinates (including the Saiyans) are shown to wear, and while traveling, often gives the appearance of weakness by exclusively using his hoverchair for transportation, leaving his henchmen to do his "dirty work".

His second form is similar in appearance to the first, except much larger, both in height and muscle mass, Frieza claiming to have nearly doubled his power in this state. He also grows longer horns, which now instead of protruding sideways from his skull curve sharply upwards into near right angles. His armor cannot contain his form and shatters, leaving him with a new, white natural armor covering his chest and shoulders. In this form, he somewhat resembles his father King Cold.

Frieza's third form is again more brutish, with an extremely elongated skull. His facial features contort and change, with his nose melding into his mouth to form a crude beak. His original horns recede, and more now erupt in pairs along the length of his head. He walks and stands with a slight hunch, as if the strain of supporting his head was too much for even Frieza's own body to bear. This form vaguely resembles a Xenomorph from the Alien movies.

Drastically differing from his previous transformations, in his final form Frieza instead regresses, becoming shorter and less bulky, his horns and spikes disappear and his physique becomes streamlined. His skin becomes pure, solid white with purple sections on his head, shoulders, forearms, chest and shins.

Frieza is also able to attain 100% power, greatly increasing his muscle mass. At 100% this is literally the peak of Frieza's potential and the maximum amount of power his body can output; his muscle mass becomes engorged compared to his previously sleek frame. However, due to the strain on his body he can not fight at full capacity for long, slowly weakening whether he is dealing or receiving damage.

Physically ruined while caught in the Planet Namek's explosion after his defeat, what remained of the still-living Frieza was salvaged and rebuilt with cybernetic enhancements by scientists under the order of King Cold. The whole of the lower half of his body and right side of his face are replaced, with scarring and metal accouterments covering what little was left of his organic self. These enhancements allowed him to exceed the limits of power imposed by his fully organic form, though how much more powerful it made him is unknown.

Frieza appears in the following "Dragon Ball Z" movies and television specials:

Dragon Ball Z: Bardock - The Father of Goku - DBZ TV Special #1; released October 17, 1990

Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge - DBZ Movie #5; released July 21, 1991

Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn - DBZ Movie #12; released March 4, 1995

In addition, Frieza's destruction of Planet Vegeta is shown from another point of view in "Burn Up!! A Close, Intense, Super-Fierce Battle" (DBZ Movie #8) and the mercenaries from "Super Deciding Battle for the Entire Planet Earth" (DBZ Movie #3) believe they would be strong enough to challenge Frieza after eating the fruit of the Tree of Might.

He also appears in footage from the Famicom game (and later Playdia remake) "Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans". In it Frieza seems to be somehow resurrected, with he and past villains Cooler, Tullece, and Lord Slug attacking Goku and his friends. Once it's revealed these are merely ghost-warriors meant to distract the heroes, however, the false Frieza and his allies are easily dealt with.

Myrmecophile

A myrmecophile is an animal that lives with ants. A myrmecophile may help the ants, or it may be a parasite of the ants by eating them or their food.
Many myrmecophiles eat waste in ant nests, such as dead ants or fungi growing in the nest. Some myrmecophiles make food that the ants can eat. Aphids do this when they make honeydew. Ants may even farm or tend some insects, such as aphids, that make food for them. Other myrmecophiles eat the food supplies of ants, and a few eat ant eggs, larvae, or pupae.

One family (group) of butterflies lives with ants and sometimes makes food for the ants. The ants help the butterfly caterpillars by keeping away other animals that want to eat or hurt the caterpillars.

Other animals that live with ants include some beetles, flies, mites, and spiders. Flies in the genus (group) called "Microdon" live in ant nests and eat waste or eat larval ants.

Medieval Latin

Medieval Latin was the form of Latin used in the Middle Ages. It was mostly used by scholars and as the liturgical language of the medieval Roman Catholic Church, but also as a language of science, literature, and administration.

Despite the clerical origin of many of its authors, Medieval Latin should not be confused with Ecclesiastical Latin. There is no real consensus on the exact boundary where Late Latin ends and Medieval Latin begins. Some scholars have their surveys of it begin with the rise of early Christian Latin in the middle of the 4th century, others around the year 500.

Honeydew

Honeydew is a liquid sugar that aphids and some scale insects make when they eat plant sap. Honeydew is very sticky.

To eat plant sap, the aphid or scale insect pushes its mouth parts into the plant. Plant sap is under pressure inside the plant. The pressure inside the plant pushes the sap into the insect. Sometimes the pressure is so great that the sap is forced out of the rear of the insect. This is how honeydew is made. The honeydew then drops from the insect and makes a sticky layer on the plant.

Honeydew on plants can cause sooty mould, which is white and appears as powder on the plant.

Honeydew is collected by some insects, such as some wasps and bees. Some honey bees make honeydew into a dark, strong honey, called honeydew honey. Honeydew honey is valuable in parts of Europe and Asia because people think it can be used as a medicine.

Ants collect honeydew from aphids. Many ants even harvest the honeydew directly from the aphids. This helps the aphids, because the ants chase predators, such as lady beetles, away from the aphids.

<doc id="61661" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61661" title="Ecclesiastical Latin">
Ecclesiastical Latin

The term Ecclesiastical Latin (sometimes called Church Latin) means the Latin language that is used in documents of the Roman Catholic Church and in its Latin liturgies. It is not a distinct language or dialect, but only the Latin language used for ecclesiastical purposes, because the same language can be used also for commercial or other purposes.

The Church issued the dogmatic definitions of the first seven General Councils in Greek, and even in Rome Greek remained at first the language of the liturgy and the language in which the first Popes wrote. The Holy See is not obliged to use Latin as its official language and, in theory, could change its practice.

But Latin has the advantage that the meaning of its words have less likelihood of changing radically from century to century. This helps to ensure theological precision and orthodoxy. Accordingly, recent Popes have reaffirmed the importance of Latin for the Church and in particular for those undertaking ecclesiastical studies.

<doc id="61662" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61662" title="Mate (drink)">
Mate (drink)

Mate is a traditional drink in some countries in South America, especially in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. It is also common in parts of Chile, Brazil, Lebanon, and Syria. The drink, which contains caffeine, is made by an infusion of dried leaves of yerba mate ("Ilex paraguariensis"). It is usually drunk with friends and served in a hollow calabash gourd with a "Bombilla", a special metallic drinking straw. The straw is also called a "bomba" in Portuguese, and a "masassa" in Arabic. It is traditionally made of silver. The gourd is known as a "mate" or a "guampa". In Brazil it called a "cuia". Even if the water comes in a very modern thermos, the drink is traditionally drunk from "mates" or "cuias". There are now modern "tea-bag" type infusions of mate called "mate cocido" which have been sold in Argentina for many years. They are drunk froma cup. They are sold under such trade names as "Cruz de Malta" (Maltese Cross) and in Brazil under the name "Mate Leão" (Lion Mate).
Like other brewed herbs, "yerba mate" leaves are dried, chopped, and ground into a powder called "yerba". The "bombilla" is both a straw and a sieve. The end which is place in the drink is wider, with small holes or slots that let the brewed liquid in, but block the chunky matter that makes up much of the mixture. A modern "bombilla" uses a straight tube with holes, or spring sleeve to act as a sieve. "Bombilla" means "light bulb" in Spanish, but locally it is "little pump" or "straw".

"Mate" is made differently in different places, with many arguments about which way is the best. In nearly all methods,the gourd is nearly filled with "yerba", and hot water (typically at 70–80 °C <nowiki>[</nowiki>160–180 °F<nowiki>]</nowiki> and never boiling) is added.

The most common way to make mate involves a careful arrangement of the "yerba" in the gourd before adding hot water. The gourd is filled one-half to three-quarters of the way with "yerba". Extra herbs may be added for either health or flavor benefits. This is most often done in Paraguay, where people get herbs from a local yuyera (herbalist). The "mate" is used as a base for their herbal infusions. When the gourd is filled, the preparer typically grasps it with their full hand. They cover the opening and roughly seal it with their palm. Then the "mate" is turned upside-down, and shaken vigorously, but briefly and with gradually decreasing force, in this inverted position causing the finest, most powdery particles of the "yerba" to settle toward the preparer's palm and the top of the mate.

Once the "yerba" is settled, the mate is carefully brought to a near-sideways angle, with the opening tilted just slightly upward of the base. The mate is then shaken very gently with a side-to-side motion. This further settles the "yerba" inside the gourd so that the finest particles move toward the opening and the "yerba" is layered along one side. The largest stems and other bits create a partition between the empty space on one side of the gourd and the lopsided pile of "yerba" on the other.

After arranging the "yerba" along one side of the gourd, the "mate" is carefully tilted back onto its base, minimizing further disturbances of the "yerba" as it is re-oriented to allow consumption. Some avalanche-like settling is normal, but is not desirable. The angled mound of "yerba" should remain, with its powdery peak still flat and mostly level with the top of the gourd. A layer of stems along its slope will slide downward and accumulate in the space opposite the "yerba" (though at least a portion should remain in place).

All of this careful settling of the "yerba" ensures that each sip contains as little particulate matter as possible, creating a smooth-running mate. The finest particles will then be as distant as possible from the filtering end of the "bombilla". With each draw, the smaller particles would inevitably move toward the "bombilla", but the larger particles and stems filter much of this out. A sloped arrangement provides consistent concentration and flavor with each filling of the "mate".

Now the "mate" is ready to receive the "bombilla". Many people choose to pour warm water into the "mate" before adding the "bombilla", while others insist that the "bombilla" is best inserted into dry "yerba". Wetting the "yerba" by gently pouring cool water into the empty space within the gourd until the water nearly reaches the top, and then allowing it to be absorbed into the yerba before adding the "bombilla", allows the preparer to carefully shape and "pack" the "yerba"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s slope with the "bombilla"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s filtering end, which makes the overall form of the "yerba" within the gourd more resilient and solid. Dry "yerba", on the other hand, allows a cleaner and easier insertion of the "bombilla", though care must be taken so as not to overly disturb the arrangement of the "yerba". Such a decision is entirely a personal or cultural preference. The "bombilla" is inserted with your thumb on the upper end of the bombilla, at an angle roughly perpendicular to the slope of the "yerba", so that its filtering end travels into the deepest part of the yerba and comes to rest near or against the opposite wall of the gourd.

Now the "yerba" may be brewed. If the "bombilla" was inserted into dry "yerba", the mate must first be filled once with warm water as above, then be allowed to absorb it completely (which generally takes no more than two or three minutes). Treating the "yerba" with cool water before the addition of hot water is essential, as it protects the herb from being scalded and from the chemical breakdown of some of its desirable nutrients. Hot water may then be added by carefully pouring it, as with the cool water before, into the cavity opposite the "yerba", until it reaches almost to the top of the gourd when the "yerba" is fully saturated. Care should be taken to maintain the dryness of the swollen top of the "yerba" beside the edge of the gourd's opening.

Once the hot water has been added, the mate is ready for drinking. It may be refilled many times before becoming washed out ("lavado") and losing its flavor. When this happens, the mound of "yerba" can be pushed from one side of the gourd to the other, allowing water to be added along its opposite side; this revives the "mate" for additional re-fillings.

"Mate" is traditionally drunk in a particular social setting, such as family gatherings or with friends. One person (known in Spanish as the "cebador") assumes the task of server. Typically, the cebador fills the gourd and drinks the "mate" completely to ensure that it is free of particulate matter and of good quality. The server subsequently refills the gourd and passes it to the next drinker who likewise drinks it all, without thanking the server. The ritual proceeds around the circle in this fashion until the "mate" becomes "lavado" ("washed out" or "flat"), typically after the gourd has been filled about ten times or more depending on the "yerba" used (well-aged "yerba mate" is typically more potent, and therefore provides a greater number of refills). When one has had his fill of "mate", he or she politely thanks the "cebador" passing the "mate" back at the same time. 

The drink has a pungent taste like a cross between green tea and coffee, with hints of tobacco and oak. Some drinkers like to add sugar or honey, creating "mate dulce" (sweet "mate"), instead of sugarless "mate amargo" (bitter "mate"). It is considered bad for the gourd (especially for the natural (squash or wood) ones) to be used for "mate dulce" so it is normal for households with drinkers of both kinds to have two separate gourds.

Traditionally, natural gourds are used, though wood vessels, bamboo tubes and gourd-shaped "mates", made of ceramic or metal (stainless steel or even silver) are also common. Gourds are commonly decorated with silver, sporting decorative or heraldic designs with floral motifs.

Both the wood vessels and the gourds must undergo "curing" to get a better taste before being used for the first time and to ensure the long life of the gourd. Typically, to cure a gourd, the inside is first scraped with the tip of a bombilla to remove loose gourd particles. "Mate" herb and hot water is added next, and the mixture poured into the gourd. The mixture is left to sit overnight and the water is topped off periodically through the next 24 hours as the gourd absorbs the water. Finally the gourd is scraped out, emptied, and put in sunlight until completely dry.

It is common for a black mold to grow inside the gourd when it is stored. Some people will clean this out, others consider it an enhancement to the mate flavor.

The Guaraní people started drinking mate in the region that now includes Paraguay, southern Brazil, and north-east Argentina. The Guaraní have a legend that says that the Goddesses of the Moon and the Cloud came to the Earth one day to visit it but they instead found a Yaguareté (a kind of jaguar) that was going to attack them. An old man saves them, and, in compensation, the Goddesses gave the old man a new kind of plant, from which he could prepare a "drink of friendship".

There is another drink that can be prepared with specially cut dry leaves, very cold water and, optionally, lemon or another fruit juice, called "tereré". It is very common in Paraguay. Drinking and harvesting of Mate started in Paraguay in pre-Hispanic times. (Notice its scientific name, "Ilex paraguayensis".)

In Brazil the traditional "mate" or "cuia" is usually big with a corresponding large hole. In Uruguay and Argentina (especially in the capital, Buenos Aires) the mate is small and has a small hole, and people sometimes add sugar for flavor. In Bolivia and Peru, "mate de coca" is often sipped instead of ordinary mate.

In Uruguay there is even a national law that prohibits drinking "mate" while driving, because it caused many accidents of people getting scalded with hot water while driving. For the same reason, there is also a "forbidden to drink mate" sign in all public transportation buses. 

In Uruguay and in the northeast of Argentina it is not uncommon to see people walking around the streets toting a "mate" and a thermos with hot water. In Montevideo, Uruguay’s capital, it is possible to see some construction worker drinking mate while riding his bicycle early in the morning, on his way to work. In some parts of Argentina, gas stations sponsored by "yerba mate" producers provide free hot water to travellers, specifically for the purpose of drinking during the journey. There are disposable mate sets with a plastic mate and bombilla, and sets with a thermos flask and stacking containers for the yerba and sugar inside a fitted case.

In Brazil, traditionally prepared mate is known as "chimarrão", although in areas near the border with Uruguay the word "mate" is also used. Nowadays, in Brazil, "mate" is often toasted with sugar and prepared in a similar manner to tea, a custom that originated in Paraguay. Supermarkets, restaurants and fast food chains sell "tea bags" and prepacked "iced tea" packages and bottles. In Argentina, "mate cocido" (cooked mate) is made with a teabag or leaves and drunk from a cup or mug, with or without sugar and milk.

At the beginning of the 21st century most urban Chileans are not mate drinkers, but travel narratives such as Maria Graham's Journal of a Residence in Chile [2003(1824):8], show that there is a long history of mate drinking in central Chile. Many rural Chileans drink "mate", in particular in the southern regions, particularly Chiloé and Magallanes, perhaps due to the influence of neighboring areas of Argentina. 

In some areas of the Middle Eastern countries of Syria and Lebanon it is also common to drink mate. The custom of drinking "mate" came from Arab emigrants from South America. Syria is the world's biggest importer of yerba mate in the world, importing 15,000 tons of yerba mate a year.

According to a major retailer of mate in San Luis Obispo, California, by 2004 "mate" had grown to about 5% of the overall natural tea market in North America . Bottled iced mate is widely available in California.

Yerba mate

Yerba mate, Ilex paraguariensis, is a species of holly (family Aquifoliaceae) native to subtropical South America. It grows in Argentina, southern Paraguay, western Uruguay and southern Brazil.
The yerba mate plant is a shrub or small tree. It can grow up to 15 meters tall. The leaves are evergreen, 7–11 cm long and 3–5.5 cm wide. They have a serrated margin. The flowers are small, greenish-white, with four petals. The fruit is a red berry 4–6 mm diameter. 

The infusion called "mate" is prepared by steeping dry leaves (and twigs) of yerba mate in hot water, rather than boiling water like black tea or coffee. It is slightly weaker than coffee and much gentler on the stomach. Drinking mate with friends from a shared hollow gourd (also called a "mate" in Spanish, or "cabaça" or "cuia" in Portuguese) with a metal straw (a "bombilla" in Spanish, "bomba" or "canudo" in Portuguese) is an extremely common social practice in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, southern Chile, eastern Bolivia and Brazil

Brewed yerba tastes a lot like vegetables, herbs, and grass. It is similar to that of some varieties of green tea. Many consider the flavor to be very agreeable, but it is generally bitter if steeped in boiling water. It is therefore made using hot but not boiling water. Unlike most teas, it does not become bitter and astringent when steeped for extended periods, and the leaves may be infused several times. Additionally, one can purchase flavored mate in many varieties.

In Brazil, a toasted version of mate, known as "chá mate" or "mate tea", is sold in teabag and loose form, and served, sweetened, in specialized shops, either hot or iced with fruit juice or milk. An iced, sweetened version of toasted mate is sold as a soft drink, with or without fruit flavoring. The toasted variety of mate has less of a bitter flavor and more of a spicy fragrance. It is more popular in the coastal cities of Brazil, as opposed to the far southern states where it is consumed in the traditional way (green, drunk with a silver straw from a shared gourd).

Similarly, a form of mate is sold in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay in tea bags to be drunk in a similar way to tea. This is known in Spanish as "mate cocido" or "cocido". In Argentina this is commonly drunk with breakfast or as part of "merienda" (roughly, afternoon tea), often with a selection of "facturas" (sweet pastries). It is also made by heating yerba in water and straining it as it cools.

The pronunciation of "yerba mate" in standard Spanish is . The Rioplatense dialect spoken in most of Argentina turns the first sound in "yerba" into a postalveolar fricative consonant, giving in regions closer to Buenos Aires, gradually blending into as one goes farther from the city, and eventually to around Mendoza. The word "hierba" is Spanish for grass or herb; "yerba" is a variant spelling of it which is quite common in Argentina. "Mate" is from the Quechua "mati", meaning "cup". "Yerba mate" is therefore literally the "cup herb".

The (Brazilian) Portuguese name is "erva mate" (also pronounced as in some regions) and is also used to prepare the drinks "chimarrão" (hot) or "tereré" (cold). While the tea is made with the toasted leaves, these drinks are made with green ones, and are very popular in the south of the country. The name given to the plant in Guaraní, language of the indigenous people who first cultivated and enjoyed yerba mate, is "ka'a", which has the same meaning as "yerba".

In English-speaking countries, the spelling used is "yerba maté" (with an accented "é") —instead of "yerba mate" (without accent) as in Spanish— indicating that the pronunciation is not the same as the much more common English word "mate", by analogy with words of French origin such as "café" and other words whose "é" distinguishes their pronunciation from otherwise identically spelled English words, such as "résumé" and "resume". Linguistic prescriptivists regard this usage as erroneous, a case of hypercorrection. Purely descriptive linguists regard this sort of usage as a natural evolution of the language. ("See" Linguistic prescription.)

The plant is grown mainly in South America, more specifically in Northern Argentina (Corrientes, Misiones), Paraguay, Uruguay and southern Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paraná). The Guaraní are reputed to be the first people who cultivated the plant; the first Europeans to do this were Jesuit missionaries, who spread the drinking habit as far as Ecuador.

When the yerba is harvested, the branches are dried sometimes with a wood fire, imparting a smoky flavor. Then the leaves and sometimes the twigs are broken up.

There are many brands and types of yerba, with and without twigs, some with low powder content. Some types are less strong in flavor ("suave", "soft") and there are blends flavored with mint, orange and grapefruit skin, etc.

Mate contains xanthines, which are alkaloids in the same family as caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine, well-known stimulants also found in coffee and chocolate. Mate also contains elements such as potassium, magnesium and manganese. Caffeine content varies between 0.3% and 1.7% of dry weight (compare this to 2.5–4.5% for tea leaves, and 1.5% for ground coffee).

Mate products are sometimes marketed as "caffeine-free" alternatives to coffee and tea, and said to have fewer negative effects. This is often based on a claim that the primary active xanthine in mate is "mateine", erroneously said to be a stereoisomer of caffeine (as it is not chemically possible for caffeine to have a stereoisomer). "Mateine" is an official synonym of caffeine in the chemical databases.
Researchers at Florida International University in Miami have found that yerba mate does contain caffeine, but some people seem to tolerate a mate drink better than coffee or tea. This is expected since mate contains different chemicals (other than caffeine) from tea or coffee.

From reports of personal experience with mate, its physiological effects are similar to (yet distinct from) more widespread caffeinated beverages like coffee, tea, or guarana drinks. Users report a mental state of wakefulness, focus and alertness reminiscent of most stimulants, but often remark on mate's unique lack of the negative effects typically created by other such compounds, such as anxiety, diarrhea, "jitteriness", and heart palpitations. (The laxative effect of coffee derives from a substance that surrounds the raw bean, not the caffeine itself.)

Reasons for mate's unique physiological attributes are beginning to emerge in scientific research. Studies of mate, though very limited, have shown preliminary evidence that the mate xanthine cocktail is different from other plants containing caffeine most significantly in its effects on muscle tissue, as opposed to those on the central nervous system, which are similar to those of other natural stimulants. Mate has been shown to have a relaxing effect on smooth muscle tissue, and a stimulating effect on myocardial (heart) tissue.

Mate's negative effects are anecdotally claimed to be of a lesser degree than those of coffee, though no explanation for this is offered or even credibly postulated, except for its potential as a placebo effect. Many users report that drinking yerba mate does not prevent them from being able to fall asleep, as is often the case with some more common stimulating beverages, while still enhancing their energy and ability to remain awake at will. However, the net amount of caffeine in one preparation of yerba mate is typically quite high, in large part because the repeated filling of the mate with hot water is able to extract the highly-soluble xanthines extremely effectively. It is for this reason that one mate may be shared among several people and yet produce the desired stimulating effect in all of them.

In-vivo and in-vitro studies are showing yerba mate to exhibit significant cancer-fighting activity. Researchers at the University of Illinois (2005) found yerba mate to be "rich in phenolic constituents" and to "inhibit oral cancer cell proliferation".
On the other hand, a study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer showed a limited correlation between oral cancer and the drinking of hot mate (no data were collected on drinkers of cold mate). Given the influence of the temperature of water, as well as the lack of complete adjustment for age, alcohol consumption and smoking, the study concludes that mate is "not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans". 

An August 11, 2005 United States patent application (documents #20050176777, #20030185908, and #20020054926) cites yerba mate extract as an inhibitor of MAO activity; the maximal inhibition observed "in vitro" was 40–50%. A monoamine oxidase inhibitor is a type of antidepressant, so there is some data to suggest that yerba mate has a calming effect in this regard.

In addition, it has been noted by the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine that yerba mate can cause high blood pressure when used in conjunction with other MAO inhibitors (such as Nardil and Parnate).

Guarana

Guarana or Guaraná (, or ), "Paullinia cupana" (syn. "P. crysan, P. sorbilis"), is a shrub or small tree in the Sapindaceae family. It is native to Venezuela and northern Brazil. The seed of the Guaraná fruit is a stimulant with thermogenic and diuretic properties.

The guaraná fruit's color ranges from orange to red and contain black seeds which are partly covered by white arils. The color contrast when the fruit has been split open has been likened to eyeballs; this has formed the basis of a myth "(see below)".

Guaraná plays an important role in Tupi and Guaraní Brazilian culture. The name 'guaraná' is derived from the Tupi-Guarani word "wara'ná". These tribes believed, it was magical, a cure for bowel complaints and a way to regain strength. They also tell the myth of a 'Divine Child' that was killed by a serpent and whose eyes gave birth to this plant.

Guaraná is mainly used as an ingredient in soft drinks and energy drinks. It is also used as a dietary supplement, generally to promote weight loss. In addition, it may be an ingredient in other foods.

In addition to other chemicals, the guaraná plant contains caffeine (sometimes called "guaranine"), theophylline, and theobromine. Water extracts of the guarana plant are central nervous system stimulants due to the content of these alkaloids. Energy drink manufacturers typically add synthetic caffeine or caffeine derived from coffee decaffeination, though many advertise "natural" caffeine from the seeds of guaraná. 

Brazil produces several brands of soft drink from guaraná extract that contain no added caffeine. Each differs greatly in flavour; some have only a slight guaraná fruit taste. In Brazil, sales of guaraná drinks are even greater than that of cola drinks. They are typically fizzy and sweet, with a very fruity aftertaste. Most guaraná drinks are produced in Brazil and consumed locally or in nearby countries, such as Paraguay. Major brands include Guaraná Antarctica, Guaraná Schin from Schincariol and Guaraná Brahma from AmBev, Kuat, and Guaraná Jesus, a local Brazilian brand named for the druggist that formulated it. Many local producers also create drinks not for export.

Studies involving guaraná show benefits to cognitive function. They have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any similar government agencies. In the United States, guaraná holds a GRAS-status, i.e. "generally regarded as safe" and must be labeled as "not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease."

The Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics published a study in June 2001. This study shows an average 11.2 pound weight loss in a group taking a mixture of yerba mate, guaraná and damiana, compared to an average 1 pound loss in a placebo group after 45 days.

A university study in Brazil of guaraná extract showed a platelet aggregation decrease of up to 37% of control values and a decrease of platelet thromboxane formation from arachidonic acid of up to 78% of control values. This study may be significant to stroke and heart attack risk reduction because when excess thromboxane formation occurs, an arterial blood clot can develop, resulting in a heart attack or ischemic stroke.

A separate 1997 study of guaraná's effects on the physical activity of rats showed increased memory retention and physical endurance when compared with a placebo.

Other studies have shown antioxidant, antibacterial, and fat cell reduction (when combined with conjugated linoleic acid) properties in guaraná 

Although side-effects of guaraná are rare, drugs.com recommends, "When considering the use of herbal supplements, consultation with a primary health care professional is advisable. Additionally, consultation with a practitioner trained in the uses of herbal/health supplements may be beneficial, and coordination of treatment among all health care providers involved may be advantageous". Drugs.com also advises not to mix guaraná with ephedrine.

Guaraná seeds consist of mostly reddish vegetable fiber and resin with a small amount of oil and water. Guarana contains different amounts of caffeine, theobromine, theophylline and other alkaloids, compared to coffee, tea, mate, or cocoa.

The chemical "guaranine" is identical to caffeine coming from other sources, for example coffee, tea and mate. Guaranine, theine, mateine are all official synonyms for caffeine.

Engrish is a word that is used to talk about types of the English language with grammar mistakes in them. Engrish can be found in East Asian countries, and also many places in other places where a lot of East Asians live. Engrish has been found on many things from poorly translated signs, menus, and manuals to strangely worded advertisements, food items, and strange t-shirt slogans. Engrish also sometimes happens when a word or sentence is badly translated on the Internet. 

The name "Engrish" comes from the fact that some languages, such as Japanese, do not have separate sounds for "R" and "L."

Sacred cow

In the religion of Hinduism, the animal called a "cow" is thought to be sacred, or very holy. Most Hindus respect the cow for her gentle nature which represents the main teaching of Hinduism, non-injury (ahimsa). The cow also represents ghee and strength . Hindus worship the cow. The cow is very honored in society, and most Hindus do not eat beef (the meat that come from cows). By honoring this gentle animal (living thing that is not a plant) that gives more than it takes, Hindus honor all creatures.

It is evidently known that the cow was sacred and forbidden in the Hindu diet as was all slaughter and violence for food, from ancient Vedic times. Therefore, reverence for cows can be found in all the religion's major texts. 

The cow gives milk and cream, yogurt and cheese, butter and ice cream, ghee and buttermilk. The milk of a cow is believed to refine a person. The ghee (clarified butter) from the milk is used in ceremonies and in preparing religious food. Cow dung is used as fertilizer, as a fuel and as a disinfectant in homes. Modern science states that the smoke from cow dung is a powerful disinfectant and is good against pollution. The cow's urine is also used for religious ceremonies as well as for medical reasons.

To the Hindu, the cow represents all other creatures. Hindus believe that all living creatures are sacred—mammals, fishes, birds. The cow is more, a symbol of the Earth. It always gives and feeds, representing life and the support of life. Honoring the cow inspires in people the virtues of gentleness and connectedness with nature. The cow takes nothing but water, grass and grain, while it gives of its milk, as does the liberated soul give of his spiritual knowledge. 

In the Hindu tradition, the cow is honored, garlanded and given special feedings at festivals all over India, most importantly the annual Gopashtama festival. Its nature is represented in Kamadhenu, the divine, wish-fulfilling cow. In India, more than 3,000 institutions called Gaushalas care for old and infirm cows. The gift of a cow is applauded as the highest kind of gift. 

“One can measure the greatness of a nation and its moral progress by the way it treats its animals. Cow protection to me is not mere protection of the cow. It means protection of all that lives and is helpless and weak in the world. The cow means the entire subhuman world.” Mahatma Gandhi.

“The cows have come and have brought us good fortune. In our stalls, contented, may they stay! May they bring forth calves for us, many-colored, giving milk for Indra each day. You make, O cows, the thin man sleek; to the unlovely you bring beauty. Rejoice our homestead with pleasant lowing. In our assemblies we laud your vigor.” Rig Veda (4.28.1;6) In the Rig Veda, cows represent wealth and joyous Earthly life. Several hymns refer to ten thousand and more cattle.

<doc id="61684" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61684" title="Murti">
Murti

In Hinduism, a murti (also spelled murthi or murthy) usually means an image in which the Divine Spirit is expressed ('murta'). Hindus call the presence of God into the image so that they can communicate with him and receive his blessings.

Murtis sometimes are abstract, but almost always stone or metal images of God in a human-like form like Shiva or Ganesha, Rama or Krishna, Saraswati or Kali. Murtis are made according to strict prescriptions and then installed by highly trained priests through a ceremony. The priests can then call on God in the image daily.

Murtis in Hindu temples and shrines are a mystical form of communication with God and devas. This is similar to our ability to communicate with others through the telephone. One does not talk to the telephone; rather the telephone is a way to interact with another person. Without the telephone, one could not have a conversation across long distances; and without the sanctified image in the temple, one cannot easily talk with the Deity.

The image or murti of worship is a focus for prayers, although Hindus can see God is in all things, in stone and water, fire, air and ether, in the enlightened person of a satguru and inside their own soul. Some temples do not have any murti in the sanctum but a symbolic diagram. Some Hindu branches reject the worship of images.

In Hinduism, one of the highest achievements is when one goes beyond the need of all form and symbol. This is the yogi’s goal obtained through meditation. In this way, Hinduism is one of the least image-oriented of all the religions of the world. However, Hinduism is also one of the religions that uses more symbols to represent God in preparation for getting beyond them.

Image worship appears to be an intelligent, mystical practice shared by all of the world’s great religions. All religions have their symbols of holiness: the Christian cross, or statues of Mother Mary and Saint Theresa, the holy Kaaba in Mecca, the Sikh Adi Granth enshrined in the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the Arc and Torah of the Jews, the image of a meditating Buddha, the totems of indigenous and Pagan faiths, and the artifacts of the holy men and women of all religions. Any Christian respects the Bible and considers it sacred. His book and the Hindu’s murtis are similar in this way. 

Critics of image worship consider this practice "idolatry". People who practice idolatry believe that God is the material object itself. Instead, Hindus worship murtis to call on the presence of the spiritual God and then communicate with him.

Virtual memory

Virtual memory is the memory management technique which is a recent trend of technology used in computers. Computers run software. This software will need computer memory to run, and do what it needs to do. Most computers in use today can do more than one thing at a time, they run more than one application. This is known as multiprocessing. 

In this case, all the programs or applications that are running on the computer at a time share its resources. A computer does not have more processors or main memory just because more programs run on it.

Virtual memory is the idea that the application "sees" a "block of memory" of a given size. The application can use this memory as it sees fit. This block of memory is "virtual" in the sense that it comes from different parts. Some of it may be in the main memory of the computer, but some may also be on disk. The CPU has a special part, called Arithmetic Logic Unit which does some of the translations between application memory and system resources. Modern operating systems also do a part of this work.

When a program tries to access a block of memory that is not in system memory, that program is stopped, and the block is loaded into system memory. What was in that part of the system memory is written to disk. This is usually called paging.

Certain computer systems, such as embedded systems, do not use virtual memory, because they need a very fast response time, or one that always stays the same. One of the problems is that with virtual memory it is difficult to predict the response time. An application that uses a part of memory which needs to be loaded from disk will have a different response time from one that does not. Therefore virtual memory concept is not used in embedded systems.

Bolshoi Theatre

The Bolshoi Theatre (Russian: Большой театр, Bol'shoy Teatr, Large Theater) is a world-famous theatre and opera company in Moscow, Russia, which gives performances of ballet and opera. It is in the centre of Moscow, near the Kremlin.

In 1776 the history of the Bolshoi Theatre began when Empress Catherina II allowed Prince Pyotr Urusov to run theatrical performances.. That theatre burned down and a new one was built in 1825. That one burnt down too, but it was rebuilt and reopened in 1856. After that, no important repairs were made to the building for 150 years. By the beginning of the 21st century it was in a very bad state and in danger of falling down. Major repairs were started in 2005, and the work should be completed by the end of October 2011. When it is finished the theatre should look just as it did at the time of the tsars, with embroidered silk tapestry and the tsar's sign replacing the communist hammers and sickles. The total cost of the rebuild will be around £400 million which is 16 times what they originally said it would cost.

The theatre is lucky to survive at all. At the time of the Communist Revolution (1917), the Bolsheviks thought the theatre represented the old tsars and everything that had been bad in Russia. They wanted to demolish it. Then they started to use it for their meetings. Lenin and Stalin both gave speeches there. The operas that were performed had to be ones that did not criticize the Soviet Union in any way

Guild

A Guild is an association of craftspeople. They come from Europe and were born in the XI century. Several people in the same craft or trade got together and formed a guild. That way it was easier for them to stand up for their interests, for example in politics. They maybe watched other people who did the same job to make sure that they did not cheat any customers. The earliest guilds were probably formed in India around 3800 BC. Being a member of a guild was a privilege, which had to be gained.

Guilds were common place in the cities of the Middle Ages. After that, around 1700 to 1800 their influence lessened. Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith were very very much opposed to the idea of guilds. They believed that guilds hindered economic development and free trade.

Delara Darabi (دلارا دارابى) (born September 29, 1986 - died May 1, 2009) was a Iranian girl, who was sentenced to death at age of 17. She was convicted for murder, despite her highly probably innocence and was executed by hanging.

Her case has raised controversy for number a reasons:

Delara's sentence was upheld by Iran's Supreme Court. The only person who could commute the sentence is Iranian Head of Judiciary, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi.

In January 2007, Delara attempted to commit suicide.

Darabi was kept in Rasht Prison. According to her family and attorney, she was severely beaten by prison guards and fellow prisoners and left with a broken arm. Conditions in prison were extremely poor, leading Delara to repeatedly file requests to be transferred to another prison with better sanitary and overall conditions. Her requests were not been answered.

Darabi was also a talented painter, poet and pianist. Her paintings were exhibited in Tehran and, recently, in Amsterdam.

She was executed May 1, 2009.

There was a petition on-line to save Darabi. A similar petition was started by Miss Canada 2003 Nazanin Afshin-Jam for another Iranian minor, Nazanin Fatehi, who was also sentenced to death. After worldwide attention and over 350,000 signatures Nazanin Fatehi was finally found innocent and freed. Amnesty International has also made many public statements and a letter campaign about Darabi.

She was born in city of Rasht (Province of Gilan), where she was a high-school student before her arrest. She had three sisters: Elaheh (21-year old), Ghazale (19) and Sheida (8). Elaheh and Ghazale are college students.

Croydon is a place in south London, England and is part of the London Borough of Croydon. It is the 20 best shopping area in the UK, and currently has two shopping centres called Centrale and the Whitgift Centre, with a third one called Park Place planned. There is a large bus station on the edge of Croydon, called West Croydon, and two train stations.

The town is well known for holding a lot of offices for companies to let. The council wants to keep Croydon a big town by building more offices and entertainment facilities so a new re-generation plan called the Croydon Gateway is planned. Purley Way, just west of Croydon, is a large retail park area which has many shops like Comet, Sainsbury's, McDonald's, IKEA, Argos, M&S, Boots along with a cinema and bowling alley.

Tramlink, a tram system, is mainly centred in Croydon. It is the only tram system in the whole of London at the moment. There are three routes that operate on the system, Route 1, Route 2 and Route 3 or Yellow, Red and Green. The tram goes to places like Elmers End and Beckenham in Bromley, Wimbledon and Mitcham in Merton and Addington and Addiscombe in Croydon.

The town grew up from Anglo-Saxon times around a Palace belonging to the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1276 the archbishop allowed a weekly market to take place nearby and this date is taken as the founding of the town. The town grew in the eighteenth century as a stage coach stop on the way to the popular seaside town of Brighton from London. In the nineteenth century railways put the town only 15 minutes from London by fast train and it grew 23 times in terms of the number of people living there between 1801 and 1901.

The coat of arms of a country is a symbol that the country uses for itself. The coat of arms of India is the symbol of India, formally called as 'National emblem'. It has four Indian lions standing on a circle. The idea for this coat of arms was taken from the Sarnath Lion Capital that was built by an Indian emperor named Ashoka. It's a pillar in the city named Sarnath. Ashoka built it around 250 BCE using a single piece of polished sandstone. The symbol is invariably used on all types of currency notes and coins of India. In the two dimensional view of this symbol, one can only see three lions, facing left right and straight. The fourth one remains hidden behind the three.

The lions represent royalty and pride.
The wheel beneath the lions, called the Ashoka Chakra represents truth and honesty. The horse and the bull probably stand for the hardworking people of India. There are four Ashoka Chakras in total around the emblem and two horses and bulls each. 
The verse written below, Satyamev Jayate is a very popular and revered saying in the ancient language Sanskrit. 
It can be divided phonetically into three words - Satyam, which means truth, Ev or aev, that is, only and Jayate which means wins or won.
The whole verse can be translated as, 'Only (the one who speaks) the truth will win or wins.'
This verse describes the power of honesty and truth in society and religion. You can lie to your friends, family, even your God, but you cannot lie to yourself. Your conscience will forever be stained.

The verse can also be translated as '(In the end) Only the truth will win'. Meaning that even after all the lies and deceptions with which we have been fooled, the truth will finally emerge victorious.

Crystal Palace

Crystal Palace is a place and former site of a landmark in London, England. The town is located between the London Boroughs of Croydon, Bromley, Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham. 

The town is home of the Crystal Palace television mast, a large aerial which receives television and radio signals so that people in London can hear or see the channels. The Croydon Transmitter was also put in Crystal Palace, so if something went wrong with the Crystal Palace Ariel this one could take over.

The space used to hold The Crystal Palace, a large building made mostly out of glass. It was called The Great Exhibition of 1851 and used to be in Hyde Park, but the palace was moved to Crystal Palace in 1854. People went to it for over seven decades. Sydenham Hill, where the Crystal Palace was, is one of the highest locations in London and the size of the palace made it easy to see from Central London. This led to the area around the building becoming known as Crystal Palace instead of Sydenham Hill. The palace was destroyed by fire on the 30 November 1936 and the site of the building and its grounds are now known as Crystal Palace Park and include an olympic sized swimming pool.

Crystal Palace Park is a large park in Crystal Palace, which is known across South London, mainly for the statues of the dinosaurs. There is also a stadium used for national athletics and a large sports centre. 

There is no town centre in Crystal Palace, as most of the area is covered by homes, although many people confuse Upper Norwood town centre (which has a Sainsbury's in it) as Crystal Palace. Anerley is also close by. There is a bus station on Crystal Palace Parade and there is a train station in Crystal Palace for Central London and Croydon.

Al-Askari mosque

Al-`Askarī or the `Askariyya Mosque/Shrine (Arabic: مرقد الامامين علي الهادي والحسن العسكري; transliterated: "Marqad al-Imāmayn `Alī l-Hādī wa l-Ħassan al-`Askarī") is a Shī`a Muslim holy site. It is located in the Iraqi city of Samarra. Samara is 60 miles from Baghdad. It is one of the most important Shīite mosques in the world. It was built in 944. Its dome was destroyed in February 2006 (see al-`Askarī Mosque Bombing).

The remains of the tenth and eleventh Shī`a Imāms, `Alī l-Hādī and his son Hassan al-`Askarī, known as "the two "`Askarī"s" ("al-`Askariyyān"), rest at the shrine. It stands next to a shrine to the Twelfth or "Hidden" Imām, Muħammad al-Mahdī. The `Askariyya Shrine is also known as the "Tomb or Mausoleum of the Two Imāms", "the Tomb of Imāms `Alī l-Hādī and Hassan al-`Askarī" and "al-Hadhratu l-`Askariyya".

Also buried inside the Mosque are the remains of Hakimah Khatun, sister of `Alī l-Hādī, and of Narjis Khatun, mother of Muħammad al-Mahdi.

"Time" magazine reported at the time of the Al Askari Mosque bombing that “al-Askari [is] one of Shi'ite Islam's holiest sites. Only the shrines of Najaf and Karbala are more important. Even Samarra's Sunnis hold al-Askari in high esteem. The expression 'to swear by the shrine' is routinely used by both communities".

The Imāms `Alī l-Hādī (also known as "an-Naqī") and Hassan al-`Askarī lived under house arrest in the part of Samarra that had been Caliph al-Mu'tasim's military camp ("`Askaru l-Mu'tasim"). As a result, they are known as the "`Askariyyān" ("Dwellers in the Camp"). They died and were buried in their house on Abī Ahmad Street near the mosque built by Mu'tasim. A later tradition attributes their deaths to poison.

The shrine around their tombs was built in 944 by the Hamdanid governor Nasīr ad-Dawla. It became a focus for pilgrims. It was developed and rebuilt several times in following centuries, including, in particular, by Arslan al-Basasiri around 1053 and by Caliph an-Nasīr li-Dīn Allāh in 1209.

Nasir ad-Din Shah Qajar undertook the latest remodelling of the shrine in 1868, with the golden dome added in 1905. Covered in 72,000 gold pieces and surrounded by walls of light blue tiles, the dome was a dominant feature of the Samarra skyline. It was approximately 20 metres in diameter by 68 metres high.

On February 22, 2006, at 6:55 a.m. local time (0355 UTC) explosions occurred at the mosque. The explosions destroyed its golden dome and severely damaged the mosque. Several men, one wearing a military uniform, had earlier entered the mosque. They tied up the guards there and set explosives, which resulted in the blast. Two bombs were set off by five to seven men dressed as personnel of the Iraqi Special forces who entered the shrine during the morning.
At around 9 a.m. on 13 June 2007, suspected al-Qaeda people destroyed the two remaining 36m-high golden minarets flanking the dome's ruins. No fatalities were reported. Iraqi police have reported hearing "two nearly simultaneous explosions coming from inside the mosque compound at around 9 a.m." A report from state run Iraqia Television stated that "local officials said that two mortar rounds were fired at the two minarets."

Hathor

Hathor was an Egyptian goddess. She was a cow goddess and was associated with the Milky Way. She was the daughter of Ra.

There are still remains of Hathor's temple in Dendara, Egypt. Dendara was her most well known. Her temple is 37 miles away from Luxor. It is thought that the temple of Hathor was built and decorated between the second century B.C.E. and the first century C.E. It had two intricately designed columned halls with the head of the goddess Hathor engraved in to each of them. Additionally, several shrines were built on the flat roof of the temple. There was also an enclosed sacred lake where the priests and patients would bath in order to heal themselves and become pure. There was sacred treasure hidden in two underground rooms near the sanctuary. At her temple people would pray to her for good wealth. Over all, Hathor was a busy goddess, as were most of the other gods and goddesses.

Hathor is the goddess of love, beauty, dancing, music, and fertility. Hathor is one of the main goddesses. Hathor means "House of Horus". Before Hathor was the nice goddess she was the goddess of destruction. There was a myth that Ra ordered Hathor (Sekmet) to go out to eat the people. But days past and Ra wanted Sekmet (Hathor) to stop but Sekmet was enjoying it. So Ra died beer red and scattered it all over the land. And then Sekmet saw it and drank it all and got drunk. After she drank it she slept for three days and when she woke up and she didn't want to eat human flesh any more and that's how she became one of the nice goddesses. After she became a new goddess, she had a new makeover.
Hathor appeared in four different forms. In human form, Hathor had a cow head with two cow horns. She was represented as a cow because cows were highly valued animals. She wore a menat which was a special necklace. A menat is heavy a beaded necklace with a crescent shape in the front and a tall mushroom shaped piece in the back. In one of her animal forms, she was a cow with an ankh. An ankh was the symbol of life. Hathor's another animal form was a fierce lion. The last animal form is a roaring lion. Hathor's symbol was a cow with a sun disc. The ancient Egyptians drew her as the sky of the Milky Way. Hathor's titles include the Golden One, the Lady of Song, the Mistress of Maidens, and the Lady of the Sycamore.

Hathor had power over Ancient Egyptians moods. Hathor had the power to bring laughter, happiness and joy. If she was far away the Egyptians mood be miserable. If she was near, you could sense the joy and hear the laughter bubbling up. She had lots of power over the animals, for she had the power to kill all! She was sometimes a very vicious killer, or harm-doer.

<doc id="61728" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61728" title="Santorini">
Santorini

Santorini is a Greek island. The capital is Thira. Santorini is 63 miles from the island of Crete. The total population is 13,600. Santorini is a caldera. 
Human presences on the island seem to have existed since the middle of the 3rd millennium B.C. The excavations at Akrotiri have confirmed that human activity on the island continued until the eruption of the volcano around 1500 B.C, which entirely buried the island beneath very thick layers of pozzuolona, At that point, all traces of human activity vanished from the island until the end of the 13th century B.C. 
According to Herodotus, the island was initially called Strongyle (the Round One). Then later, because of its beauty, it was named Kalliste (the Fairest One). The Phoenicians settled in Kalliste, and after the Phoenicians, the Lacedaemonians arrived and renamed the island after their leader, Theras. In the 9th century B.C. Thera, became an important stopping point of that era in the travel routes between the East and the West. The Phoenician alphabet was adopted at this time for writing in the Greek language. Interestingly though, the conservative Therans, did not follow the cultural development of their counterparts in the other Cycladic islands. At about 630 B.C the Therans reached the north coast of the African continent where they founded Cyrene, the only Theran colony. From as early on as the 6th century B.C. Thera had its own coinage. During the Classical period in Greece [5th and 4th century B.C.] Thera did not play any significant role in the events of that Hellenic time. During the Peloponesian War Thera sided with Sparta, as expected. In Hellenistic times the island's strategic position made Thera an important base for the war campaigns in the Aegean of the successors to Alexander the Great. 
During the Roman Empire, Thera was little more than a small, insignificant island. However, when Christianity reached the island early, an organized church was established by the 4th century A.D. The island had neither political nor military significance in Byzantine times, although Alexius I Comnenus [1081 - 1118] founded the church of the Panagia Episkopi at Gonia. After the fall of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade [1204], the Duchy of Naxos was founded and Thera became the seat of one of the four Catholic Bishops of the Duchy. The name Santorini was given at that time by the Crusaders, named after a small chapel of Agia Irini [Santa Irene] which some say was at Perissa and others say it was at Riva on Therasia. 
In the years under Frankish rule [1207 - 1579], Santorini experienced the development of a thriving cotton cultivation and viticulture, but the island suffered as much from piratical raids as it did from the rivalries between the local Latin rulers as well as the Duke and the Sultan. 
The Turkish dominion [1579 - 1821] resulted in the abolition of piracy and the development of international trade. The Santorinians created close contacts with the great harbours of the Eastern Mediterranean (Alexandria, Constantinople, Odessa) where they founded important communities. 
In 1821, Santorini with its shipping power, took part in the fight for independence from the Turks, and in 1830, the island became part of the independent Greek state. Up until the beginning of the 20th century shipping, textiles, tomato production and viticulture were all flourishing markets, but the change from sail to steam-driven ships and the relocation of the island's factories to mainland Greece had a negative effect on the island's economy. After the 1956 earthquake there was a huge decrease in the population resulting in an economic catastrophe. Towards the end of the 1970s however, tourism began to develop, bringing economic relief to the island. 
The present-day crescent shape of the island is a consequence of the activity of the volcano in prehistoric times. The island itself owes its very existence to the volcano. 
The last huge eruption of the volcano dates back 3,600 years, to the late Bronze Age. Thirty million cubic meters of lava in the form of pumice and ash were blown to a height of up to 36 kilometers above the island. Pumice deposits, dozens of meters thick, buried one of the most prosperous pre-historic settlements of that period, feeding the myth of the lost Atlantis. 
The mild activity of the volcano after this major eruption continues into the present (the most recent eruption occurred in 1950) building up two small islands within the caldera, Palea and Nea Kameni. These islands represent the volcano's most recent activity. 
The marvelous dry climate and continuous sunshine create year around conditions which are perfect for observation, photographs and videos under an extraordinary variety of natural lights and colours that give the visitor the exceptional advantage of reaching the interior of the volcano by boat. 
Since the 1st of January 2002, the Euro (EUR) is the currency of Greece. Notes in circulation are 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 euro while coins are in denominations of 1 euro, 2 euro, 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents and 20 cents. A currency converter is available here. 

The banks on Santorini are open 8.00 am-2.30 pm Monday to Thursday and 8.00 am-2.00 pm on Friday. ATMs are available in almost all villages on Santorini. Most accept Visa and MasterCards as well as debit cards of internationally recognised networks. 

The electricity supply in Greece is alternating current, 220-250 volts, 50 cycles. Appliances for 110 or 120 volts may be operated by using step down transformers of 220 - 250/110 volts connected to each outlet. 

Bottled water is recommended for drinking. Tap water can be used for washing, bathing and cleaning your teeth. In the area of Oia the tap water that comes from the local desalination plant is drinkable. 

There is a taxi stand in the square of Fira. Taxi fares are based on a catalogue issued by the Ministry of Transport, and not based on the taxi's meter. KTEL buses carry out daily bus routes to almost all destinations. The KTEL terminal is also in the square of Fira next to the taxis. 

ELTA is the official name of the postal service and their colours are blue and yellow. The main postal offices on Santorini are in Fira, Emporio and Oia. Postal agencies are in Pyrgos, Kamari and Perissa. Mailboxes are available in all the villages of Santorini. A standard letter or postcard less than 20 grams sent anywhere in Europe or abroad costs €0.65 (as per April 2007). Courier services are also available. 

Most hotels provide internet access for their guests. Internet cafés are available mostly in Fira.

Santorini National Airport,an airport that serves as both military and civil airport, is north of the village of Kamari. The airlines that run here include Olympic Air and Aegean Airlines. To get to and from the airport you can use buses, taxis, hotel car-pickups and rental cars.

Samarra

Sāmarrā () is a town in Iraq. 
It is on the east bank of the Tigris in the Salah ad Din Governorate, 125 km north of Baghdad. , about 201,700 people lived there. 

Medieval Islamic writers believed that the name “Samarra” is derived from the Arabic phrase, “Sarre men ra’a” "سر من رأى" which translates to “A joy for all who see”. It was changed later by Armenian soldiers to "Samarra" "ساء من رأى" which means "A sad for all who see".

Al-Askari mosque, an important Shi'a holy site, is located here.

<doc id="61731" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61731" title="Holy See">
Holy See

The Holy See (Latin: "Sancta Sedes", "holy seat") is the office of the Bishop of Rome — the Pope. 
The term Holy See means also the Pope and the Roman Curia—that means the central government of the Roman Catholic Church.

Every episcopal see is seen as holy and the Eastern Orthodox Church constantly applies the adjective "holy" or "sacred" () to all its sees, but "the Holy See" (in the singular and with the definite article and no other specification) normally means the see of Rome, which is also called "the Apostolic See". While "Apostolic See" can refer to any see founded by any of the Apostles, the term is in this case used to refer to the see of the bishop seen as successor of the chief of the Apostles, Saint Peter. 

Aside from Rome, the archiepiscopal See of Mainz, which was also of electoral and primatial rank, is the only other Western see that bears the title of "Holy See", although this usage is less common.

The Pope governs the Church through the Roman Curia. The Roman Curia consists of the Secretariat of State, nine Congregations, three Tribunals, 11 Pontifical Councils, and a complex of offices that administer church affairs at the highest level. The Secretariat of State, under the Cardinal Secretary of State, directs and coordinates the Curia. The current incumbent, Tarcisio Cardinal Bertone, is the Holy See's equivalent of a prime minister. Archbishop Dominique Mamberti, Secretary of the Section for Relations With States of the Secretariat of State acts as the Holy See's foreign minister. Bertone and Mamberti have been named in their respective roles under by Pope Benedict XVI in September 2006.

Among the most active of the major Curial institutions are the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which oversees church doctrine; the Congregation for Bishops, which coordinates the appointment of bishops worldwide; the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, which oversees all missionary activities; and the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, which deals with international peace and social issues.

The Holy See is especially active in international organizations and is a member of the following groups:


The Holy See is also a permanent observer of the following groups:


The Holy See is an observer on an informal basis of the following groups:

The Holy See sends a delegate to the Arab League in Cairo. It is also a guest of honour to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
The Holy See, not the Vatican City, maintains diplomatic relations with states (such as with the United Kingdom), and participates in international organizations. Foreign embassies are accredited to the Holy See, not to the Vatican City, and it is the Holy See that establishes treaties and concordats with other sovereign entities. When necessary, the Holy See will enter a treaty on behalf of the Vatican City.

Under the terms of the Lateran Treaty, the Holy See has extraterritorial authority over 23 sites in Rome and five Italian sites outside of Rome, including the Pontifical Palace at Castel Gandolfo.
The same authority is extended under international law over the Apostolic Nunciature of the Holy See in a foreign country.

Tigris

The Tigris is a river in the Middle East. It is one of two rivers that define Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia literally means "(the land) between the rivers". The other river is called Euphrates. The source of the river is in the Taurus mountains in Turkey. From there, it flows through various countries, most notably Turkey, Syria and Iraq. The river is 1,900 kilometres long. It comes together with the Euphrates in the Shatt-al-Arab(which is called Arvand Rud in Persian). The Shatt-al-Arab flows into the Persian Gulf.

Apep

Apep (also spelled Apepi, and Aapep, or Apophis in Greek) in Egyptian mythology was an evil demon. He was associated with darkness and chaos. He was often shown as a snake.

Apep's name was often incorrectly defined as he who was "spat out". It was said that he had been formed by Neith, who had been the god of the ancient waters in the Ennead, from a length of spit she had spat at Nu, the god of the ancient waters in the Ogdoad. Some subsequent commentators speculated that Apep must have been an earlier creator, and chief god, thus explaining why he had so much anger towards Ra.

It was believed that Ra (the sun) each night passed into Duat and then battled with Apep, always winning except for certain days in which Ra is momentarily devoured, what the Egyptians saw as an eclipse.

Instead of being worshipped he was done the exact opposite and spat upon. Models would be made of wax and clay and then burnt, spat upon, and defaced.

Apep was a fifty foot long snake. He was black, orange, and a little bit green. Apep was very strong. He symbolized darkness, storms,night,underworld and death. In ramses 6th tomb they showed a picture of him, he had 9 heads,representing the souls he killed.

Prefix notation

Prefix notation is a mathematical notation. It is a way to write down equations and other mathematical formulae. Prefix notation is also known as "Polish notation". The notation was invented by Jan Łukasiewicz in 1920. He wanted to simplify writing logic equations.

When prefix notation is used, no grouping elements (like parenthesis) are needed.

With prefix notation, the function is noted before the arguments it operates on. 

Some CASIO calculators use prefix notation. Some programming languages that were influenced by lambda calculus, like LISP, use prefix notation.

<doc id="61767" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61767" title="Nephthys">
Nephthys

Nephthys was known as the goddess of mourning. She was also one of the nine gods. When Nephthys became the goddess of mourning she also became a friend and protecter of the dead. Nephthys was important in Ancient Egyptian culture because Egyptians considered the afterlife to be very important. She always stood at the head of the coffin that would take the dead to the underworld with outspread wings. Nephthys explained the nether world for the Ancient Egyptians by protecting and caring for the dead. When people died their "Ba" would be tested by 40 gods. Many of the gods met up with Nephthys. This is a small list of gods and goddesses.

Ma'at
Nut
Shu
Tefnut
Ra
Hathor
Sobek
Neith
Geb
Horus
Anubis
Isis
Sekmet

 Nephthys had many siblings. Her parents were Geb the god of the earth and Nut the goddess of the sky. She was the sister of Isis, Osiris and twin of Seth. She was married to Seth even though she did not like him. She wanted to have a baby but Seth who was the god of death could not have them. Soon she left Seth and pretended to be Isis. [Isis] was married to Osiris. Isis and Nephthys had a strong relationship. Then Nephthys had a baby with Osiris pretending to be Isis.

Nephthys was seen wearing a slender sheath dress. On her crown were the hieroglyphs of her name. She could be seen with the hieroglyph symbol of life, the ankh in her hand. She was usually seen at the head of a coffin. Some Egyptians saw Nephthys with blue skin and others saw her with tan skin.
Nephthys was the goddess of mourning. “Nephthys” usually means lady of mansion or mistress of the house but it can also mean “good sister”, “friend of the dead”, “joyful one” or “sister of the gods”.

The Ramesside Pharaohs were particularly devoted to Set's prerogatives and, in the 19th Dynasty , a temple of Nephthys called the "House of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun" was built or refurbished in the town of Sepermeru, midway between Oxyrhynchos and Herakleopolis, on the outskirts of the Fayyum and quite near to the modern site of Deshasheh. Here, as Papyrus Wilbour notes in its wealth of taxation records and land assessments, the temple of Nephthys was a specific foundation by Ramesses II, located in close proximity to (or within) the precinct of the enclosure of Set. To be certain, the House of Nephthys was one of fifty individual, land-owning temples delineated for this portion of the Middle Egyptian district in Papyrus Wilbour. The fields and other holdings belonging to Nephthys's temple were under the authority of two Nephthys-prophets (named Penpmer and Merybarse) and one (mentioned) wa'ab priest of the goddess. 

While certainly affiliated with the "House of Set," the Nephthys temple at Sepermeru and its apportioned lands (several acres) clearly were under administration distinct from the Set institution (cf. 'Land Tenure in the Ramesside Period' by S. Katary, 1989). The Nephthys temple was a unique establishment in its own right, an independent entity. According to Papyrus Wilbour (Section 1. 28), another "House of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun" seems to have existed to the north, in the town of Su, closer to the Fayyum region. Interestingly, yet another (probably contemporaneous) temple of Nephthys seems to have existed in the town of Punodjem. The Papyrus Bologna records a complaint lodged by a prophet of the temple of Set in that town regarding undue taxation in his regard. After making an introductory appeal to "Re-Horakhte, Set, and Nephthys" for the ultimate resolution of this issue by the royal Vizier, the prophet (named Pra'emhab) laments his workload. He notes his obvious administration of the "House of Set" and adds: "I am also responsible for the ship, and I am responsible likewise for the House of Nephthys, along with a heap of other temples." (Papyrus Bologna 1094, 5, 8-7, 1). 

While the House-of-Nephthys in (ostensibly) Punodjem is not explicitly said to be a foundation of Ramesses II, it may be that Ramesses II founded a series of "temples of Nephthys" (as consort of Set) in order to complement the larger establishments dedicated to her spouse, much in the same way that the smaller temple of Nefertari at Abu Simbel was complementary to (and a dependency of) the "Great Temple" at Abu Simbel. In the roster provided by Papyrus Wilbour, no other divine-consort boasted a land-owning temple of their own within any particular town dominated by a male god. Apparently, Nephthys was deemed quite important enough to merit her own independent sanctuaries. In any event, as "Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun," the goddess and her shrine(s) were under the particular endorsement of Ramesses II. The foundations of the Set and Nephthys temples at Sepermeru finally were discovered and identified in the 1980s, and the Nephthys temple was no mere chapel—rather, it was a notable, self-sustaining temple complex within the Set enclosure(cf. 'Les Deesses de l'Egypte Pharaonique', R. LaChaud, 1992, Durocher-Champollion). Likewise, there can be little doubt that a cult of Nephthys existed in the temple and great town of Herakleopolis, north of Sepermeru. A near life-sized statue of Nephthys (currently housed in the Louvre) boasts a curiously altered inscription. The basalt image originally was stationed at Medinet-Habu, as part of the cultic celebration of the Pharaonic "Sed-Festival," but obviously was transferred at some point to Herakleopolis and the temple of Herishef therein. The cult-image's inscription originally pertained to "Nephthys, Foremost of the Sed [Festival] in the Booth of Annals" (at Medinet-Habu), but was re-inscribed or re-dedicated to "Nephthys, Foremost of the [Booths of] Herakleopolis."

Anuket

Anuket was the first ancient Egyptian goddess of the Nile river in areas like Elephantine Island, at the start of the Nile's journey through Egypt, and in nearby parts of Nubia. Her temple was built at the Island of Seheil. 

Since the god Khnum and goddess Satis were thought to be the gods of the source of the Nile, Anuket was believed to be their daughter. The Egyptians believed that the two tributaries in her area of the Nile were her arms. Because tributaries move quickly, she became associated with fast-moving things, like arrows, and the gazelle. 

In art, she was usually shown as a gazelle, or with a gazelle's head, and sometimes had a headdress of feathers.

When the Nile started its annual flood, the "Festival of Anuket" began. People threw coins, gold, jewelry, and precious gifts into the river, thanking Anuket for the life-giving water. The taboo that was held in several parts of Egypt of not eating fish, which were considered sacred, was lifted during this time.

The Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) is the hypothetical common language that was spoken before the Indo-European languages developed. 

There are several competing hypotheses about when and where PIE was spoken.

The idea that there was such a language was supported by the fact, that in 1927 Jerzy Kuryłowicz discovered some of the phonemes, one supposed to be Proto-Indo-European in Anatolian. 

There is no direct evidence of PIE, because it was never written. All PIE sounds and words are reconstructed from later Indo-European languages using the comparative method and the method of internal reconstruction. The asterisk is used to mark reconstructed PIE words, such as *' 'water', *' 'dog', or *"" 'three (masculine)'. Many of the words in the modern Indo-European languages seem to have derived from such "protowords" via regular sound changes (e.g., Grimm's law).


Other long vowels may have appeared already in the proto-language by compensatory lengthening: .

Ptah

Ptah was the ancient Egyptian god of craftsmen and architects. In art, he is shown as a bearded mummified man, often wearing a skull cap, holding a djed. He was believed to be married to Sekhmet.

Ptah was the local god of Memphis, one of the ancient capitals of Egypt. He is the parson of craftsmen, since it is believed that he invented the arts. He is shown as a hairless mummylike figure holding a large tool, and at the ceremony during mummification, he uses the tool he holds.

Kurt Waldheim

Kurt Josef Waldheim (21 December 1918 – 14 June 2007) was an Austrian diplomat and conservative politician. He was Secretary-General of the United Nations from 1972 to 1981, and President of Austria from 1986 to 1992. At the time of his death he was the oldest living former Secretary-General of the United Nations and the oldest living former President of Austria. On June 14, 2007, Waldheim died of heart failure.

Shortly before 1986, Waldheim published an autobiography. During his campaign to become president in 1986, it became public that some statements in that biography were not true. These were about his past. Waldheim was an officer for Germany in the Second World War. There was a commission of several historians who looked at the issue. They did find that Waldheim had behved as he should have done. He did not commit any War crimes. However, in his role of an officer, he must have known about the deportation of about 40.000 Jews into concentration camps. These transports, as well as the shooting of soldiers were a clear breach of law.

Because of this, he was not allowed to travel to the United States any more.

In 1990, he had a success: Saddam Hussein held several foreigners as hostages at the start of the Second Gulf War. When Waldheim heard this, he personally went to Baghdad. Through talks he could get Saddam to release the Austrian and the Swiss hostages (both countries are neutral)

<doc id="61817" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61817" title="Hypothesis">
Hypothesis

A hypothesis is something that can explain a event. It can propose or suggest how two events relate to each other. The term comes from the Greek, "hypotithenai" meaning "to put under" or "to suppose." The scientific method requires that a scientific hypothesis can be tested. Scientists sometimes create hypotheses on events that have been seen before or on extensions of scientific theories.

At first, educated people often referred to an idea or to an approach to math that made hard math easier as a "hypothesis"; when used this way, the word did not necessarily have any specific meaning. Cardinal Bellarmine gave a well known example of the older sense of the word in the warning issued to Galileo in the early 17th century: that he must not treat the motion of the Earth as a reality, but merely as a hypothesis.

In common usage in the 21st century, a "hypothesis" refers to a idea that needs to be tested. A hypothesis needs more work by the researcher in order to check it. A tested hypothesis that works, may become part of a theory or become a theory itself. Normally, scientific hypotheses have the form of a mathematical model.

<doc id="61821" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61821" title="Observation">
Observation

Observation is an activity of an intelligent living being (e.g. human), which senses and assimilates the knowledge of a phenomenon in its framework of previous knowledge and ideas. 

Observation is more than the bare act of observing: To perform observation, a being must observe and seek to add to its knowledge.

Observations that come from self-defining instruments are often unreliable ­¹. Such observations are hard to reproduce because they may vary even with respect to the same stimuli. Thus they are not of much use in exact sciences like physics which require instruments which do not define themselves. It is thus often necessary to use various engineered instruments like: spectrometers, oscilloscopes, cameras, telescopes, interferometers, tape recorders, thermometers etc. and tools like clocks, scale that help in improving the , quality and utility of the information obtained from an observation. 

The accuracy and tremendous success of science is primarily attributed to the accuracy and objectivity (i.e. repeatability) of observation of the reality that science explores.

Scientific method refers to techniques for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge. To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry must be based on gathering observable, empirical and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning. A scientific method consists of the collection of data through observation and experimentation, and the formulation and testing of hypotheses.

Although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another, identifiable features distinguish scientific inquiry from other methodologies of knowledge. Scientific researchers propose hypotheses as explanations of phenomena, and design experimental studies to test these hypotheses. These steps must be repeatable in order to dependably predict any future results. Theories that encompass wider domains of inquiry may bind many hypotheses together in a coherent structure. This in turn may help form new hypotheses or place groups of hypotheses into context.

Among other facets shared by the various fields of inquiry is the conviction that the process be objective to reduce a biased interpretation of the results. Another basic expectation is to document, archive and share all data and methodology so they are available for careful scrutiny by other scientists, thereby allowing other researchers the opportunity to verify results by attempting to reproduce them. This practice, called full disclosure, also allows statistical measures of the reliability of these data to be established.

The scientific process is iterative. At any stage it is possible that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process. Failure to develop an interesting hypothesis may lead a scientist to re-define the subject they are considering. Failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject. Failure of the experiment to produce interesting results may lead the scientist to reconsidering the experimental method, the hypothesis or the definition of the subject.

Other scientists may start their own research and enter the process at any stage. They might adopt the characterization and formulate their own hypothesis, or they might adopt the hypothesis and deduce their own predictions. Often the experiment is not done by the person who made the prediction and the characterization is based on experiments done by someone else. Published results of experiments can also serve as a hypothesis predicting their own reproducibility.

City and town halls

A city hall or town hall is the headquarters of a city or town's administration and usually houses the city or town council, its associated departments and their employees. It is also usually the base of the city, town, borough or county mayor. 

In North America, a hall is labeled a "city" or "town" hall depending on the size of the municipality it serves. City halls are usually found in larger cities and town halls in smaller urban areas.

In the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and many Commonwealth countries, "town hall" is the more common term. During the 1960s many of the older town halls were replaced by "Civic centres". The civic centre was a functional building, offices of the council only, without the art gallery or hall for cultural activities which were a feature of many of the older town halls.

"County hall" is used for the headquarters of County council administrations.

Spectrometer

A spectrometer is an optical instrument used to measure properties of light over a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. 

The independent variable is usually the wavelength of the light. 
The variable measured is most often the light's intensity but could also, for instance, be the polarization state. A spectrometer is used in spectroscopy for producing spectral lines and measuring their wavelengths and intensities. Spectrometer is a term that is applied to instruments that operate over a very wide range of wavelengths, from gamma rays and X-rays into the far infrared. 

In general, any particular instrument will operate over a small portion of this total range because of the different techniques used to measure different portions of the spectrum. Below optical frequencies (that is, at microwave, radio, and audio frequencies), the spectrum analyzer is a closely related electronic device.

Spectrometers are used in spectroscopic analysis to identify materials. Spectroscopes are used often in astronomy and some branches of chemistry. Early spectroscopes were simply a prism with graduations marking wavelengths of light. Modern spectroscopes, such as monochromators, generally use a diffraction grating, a movable slit, and some kind of photodetector, all automated and controlled by a computer. The spectroscope was invented by Gustav Robert Georg Kirchhoff and Robert Wilhelm Bunsen.

Tefnut

Tefnut was the ancient Egyptian goddess of water and fertility. She and her brother and husband, Shu, were created by Atum, Ra or Amun. Tefnut was the mother of Nut and Geb. She is associated with the lion. In art she is represent as a woman with head of the lion with Sun disc.

Tefnut, along with Shu, was the first deity created by Ra. She had other names, such as Tefenet and Tefnet. She was mainly in charge of moisture, but was also responsible for Order, Time, Justice, Heaven and Hell. She was very closely related to both the sun and the moon. She was known as both the left (moon), and right (sun): 'Eyes of Ra.'

Once Tefnut fled from Ra as a lioness, causing a great drought. Only Thoth could persuade her to return, so he went to Nubia and got her back. When she got back, there was great rejoice in all the temples. After that incident, Tefnut, normally wearing her fathers’ sun disk, was seen as a lioness, or a woman with a lions’ head. Very rarely ever again was she seen portrayed as a full woman. When Tefnut was in the royal court, she wore a crown made of sprouting plants. Sometimes she was seen lying horizontally between the ground and the sky. She was sometimes pictured with her husband, Shu (god), helping to hold up Nut. She cried with the pain, and when she cried, that made the ground fertilized.

Tefnut sat in judgment of the dead in the underworld. Tefnut wears her fathers’ sun disk, a symbol of power. She carries a scepter and wears an ankh, the symbol of life. As she was the goddess of moisture, she was also related to other deities of moisture and wetness. She was seen holding up the sky with her brother/husband Shu. As she was in charge of moisture, she held other roles as well. Some of them were: Order, justice, time, the weather,Heaven, and Hell. Above all, her main role was to bring moisture down on the ancient Egyptians.

Tefnut was worshipped in lion form in Leontopolis (May-ta-hut). Part of the city of Denderah (Iunet), was known as ‘The House of Tefnut.’ Some of Tefnut’s festival dates were the 20th of August, the day of satisfying the Hearts of the Ennead. Another festival date was the 29th of October, which was the day of Going Forth of Het-Hert and the Ennead. The last festival date was the 15th of November, the Ennead Feast in the House of Kay Heru and Wasir. Tefnut does not have any main centers of Worship, or any known temples dedicated to her.

Sobek

Sobek was the ancient Egyptian god of the Nile. In art, he was shown with the head of a crocodile. In temples to Sobek, live crocodiles were kept in pools to honour him.

Sobek was worshipped wherever the nile was presenting difficulties. Sobek was the ancient Egyptian God of crocodiles and controlled the waters. Sobek’s role was to protect the pharaoh from evil. He was the most popular god in Arsinoe (Crocodilopolis in Greek), and was considered the Lord of Faiyum (a place in Egypt).

One day when Sobek was in the Nile, he saw Osiris’ (who was murdered by Seth, the god of chaos) body. He was so hungry he could not resist eating part of it. His tongue was cut off as a punishment, which is why crocodiles have no tongues in Egyptian myths. He also caught the sons of Horus when they were born.

Sobek was seen as a crocodile headed man or very rarely a plain crocodile. Egyptians mummified crocodiles in honor of Sobek. Crocodiles were treated like household pets and were adorned with anklets and other decorative jewels. In temples people kept sacred crocodiles because they thought that they were images of Sobek on earth. The sacred crocodiles were a big attraction, the Egyptian’s believed that if the crocodiles were fed and they accepted their food, you would receive blessings from the God Sobek.

Sobek was a friend of Horus. Sobek’s mother Neith was considered the sister of Isis, who was Horus’s mother. This made Sobek the cousin of Horus, which was a very important fact because Horus was a major God. In other myths, Sobek was allied with Set. Set was also sometimes thought of as Sobek's father.

<doc id="61851" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61851" title="Dar es Salaam">
Dar es Salaam

Dar es Salaam (Arabic: دار السلام "Dār as-Salām") is the largest city in Tanzania. It has a population of about 2,500,000 people. The city is also the country's richest city. It is an important economic centre. 

Dar es Salaam was the capital city of Tanzania until 1996. Even though the capital was moved to Dodoma, Dar Salaam is still the location of much of the country's government. It is also the capital of the Dar es Salaam Region. The city's name in Arabic means "Abode of Peace". Dar es Salaam was at one time called Mzizima. 

The population of Dar es Salaam is increasing at a rate of 4.39% each year. It is the 3rd fastest growing city in Africa and the 9th fastest in the world. The metropolitan area population is expected to reach 5.12 million people by 2020. 

This rate is far above the world average. Globally, the growth rate of the human population has been declining since a peak in 1962 and 1963 of 2.20% per annum. In 2009 the estimated annual growth rate was 1.1%.

The consequence of the city's population growth is to limit or reduce the standard of living of its inhabitants. This is mainly because the increase creates a need for more 'infrastructure' (housing, water, sewage plants, electricity, schools, roads, hospitals, food supply...). This need cannot be met in a poor country, and so the conditions of life get worse, not better. The term 'overpopulation' is often used to describe this situation

Dar es Salaam is located on a large harbour on the Eastern Indian Ocean coast of Africa.

Dar es Salaam has tropical weather conditions. This is because it is very near the equator and the warm Indian Ocean. The city usually has hot and humid weather during much of the year. Each year the area has two rainy seasons. These are called 'the long rains' (in April and May) and 'the short rains' (in October and November). Nearly 1100mm of rain fall each year on the area.

In 1859, Albert Roscher of Germany became the first European to go to Mzizima ("healthy town"). In 1866 Sultan Seyyid Majid of Zanzibar gave it its current name. It is an Arabic phrase meaning "Haven of Peace". Dar es Salaam had much growth starting in 1887, when the German East Africa Company created a station there. The town's growth was because it was the administrative and commercial centre of German East Africa. It was also helped by the growth of industry caused by the Central Railway Line in the early 1900s.

German East Africa was captured by the British during World War I and its name was changed to Tanganyika. Dar es Salaam was still the territory's administrative and commercial centre. 

After World War II, Dar es Salaam had a period of rapid growth. Tanganyika became independent from colonial rule in December 1961. Dar es Salaam continued to be its capital. It remained the capital when in 1964 Tanganyika and Zanzibar merged to form Tanzania. However, in 1973, it was decided to move the capital to Dodoma. This has not yet been completed, and Dar es Salaam is still Tanzania's primary city.

The NHC headquarters are located in Miami, Florida.

When tropical storm or hurricane conditions are predicted within 36 hours, the center issues the proper watches and warnings through the news media and NOAA Weather Radio. Although it is an organization of the United States, the World Meteorological Organization has designated the NHC as Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the North Atlantic and eastern and central Pacific Ocean. In other words, the NHC is the central source of information for all tropical cyclone forecasts and observations happening in these areas, despite of their effect on the US.

Gaborone is the capital city of Botswana. It has a population of 208,411 people. Gaborone is one of the fastest-growing cities in Africa. Gaborone is on the Notwane River in the southeastern corner of Botswana. It is from the South African border.

The main campus of the University of Botswana is in the city. Gaborone's airport, Sir Seretse Khama International Airport, is Botswana's main international airport.

Before 1969, the city was known as Gaberones. Gaberones replaced Mafeking as the capital of the Bechuanaland Protectorate in 1965. Mafeking was outside the Bechuanaland Protectorate. It was in an area of South Africa. When the Protectorate became independent, Botswana needed a capital city that was inside the country. It had been thought that Lobatse would be the capital. It was later decided that they would create a new capital next to Gaberones, a small colonial administrative settlement. 

The original name, Gaberones, is from Gaborone's Village. It was named after Chief Kgosi Gaborone of the BaTlokwa tribe. His village, now called Tlokweng, was just across a river from the "Government Camp" (colonial government headquarters). "Gabs" is still a common nickname for Gaborone. A newer nickname for Gaborone is G-City.

The centre of the city was constructed in three years. It includes Assembly buildings, government offices, a power station, a hospital, schools, a radio station, a telephone exchange, police stations, a post office, and more than 1,000 houses. Much of the city was in place for Independence Day on September 30 1966, when the county became independent of the United Kingdom. The first mayor of Gaborone was Rev J. D. Jones. The old Gaberones became a suburb of the new Gaborone, and is now known as "the Village".

The Libreville International Airport, the headquarters for Air Gabon, is about north of the city.

The Mpongwé tribe lived in the area long before the French took control of the land in 1839. The city was founded (as Gabon) in 1843 as a trading station. Freed slaves were sent there from the ship L'Elizia. In 1848 it was named Libreville (French for "Freetown"). It was the chief port of French Equatorial Africa from 1934 to 1946. 

Libreville was named in after Freetown. It grew slowly as a trading post and a minor administrative centre. It had a population of 31,000 when it became independent in 1960. Since independence, the city has grown more quickly. Nearly half the of the people of Gabon live in the city.

Sights in Libreville include the National Museum of Arts and Traditions, the French cultural centre, St Marie’s Cathedral, the carved wood church of St Michael, Nkembo, the Arboretum de Sibang and two cultural villages. Gabon's school of administration and school of law are in Libreville. The Omar Bongo University is also in Libreville.

Shu (god)

Shu was the ancient Egyptian god of dry air, and so was a calming and cooling influence. He was also like Atlas from Greek mythology—his job was to support the sky.

Shu had a warlike traits like Onuris and became associated with the pharaoh. He takes a human form wearing a plume (the hieroglyph of his name) on his head and with his arms raised supporting the sky-goddess Nut whom holds apart from her consert the earth god Geb. This god was described as dwelling in the sun's disk. He often appeared as a bearded man holding up the sky while protecting the earth. At times he was depicted as a lion or a human with a lion's head. At other times he wore four ostrich feathers. These four feathers symbolized the four columns that held up the sky when Shu himself was not there to do the job. When in his role as god of light, Shu carried a sun disk. Shu has many forms but one name! 

"That is my daughter, the living female one, Tefnut, who shall be with her brother Shu. Life is his name, Order is her name. [At first] I lived with my two children, my little ones, the one before me, the other behind me. Life reposed with my daughter Order, the one within me, the other without me. I rose over them, but their arms were around me." Was a hymn to Shu. Ancient Egyptians prayed to him for a good life and prayed to him for light. People worshipped Shu in prayers, hymns, and in a chapel. People gave him offerings. Shu appeared in tombs and temples. He was a well known god. 

Shu belongs to the cosmic deities and as such no temples were dedicated to him. Cosmic deitys were never worshipped in a pesonified form, therefore there was no need for temples to worshipped them. A chapel was built to Shu, Atum, and Tefnut. No festivals has been historically verified Shu was worshipped through prayers and gatherings.

Shu was the god of the water, light, wind, and the atmosphere. He was also the god of dry air. Shu's name meant "dryness" or "emptiness". Shu was mentioned in Coffin Texts and Pyramid Texts, but is not well known outside these religious texts until after the New Kingdom. During this time period, Shu became connected with the gods Onuris, Khonsu, and Soptu, and was worshipped along with them in their local cults. He was praised by some and not by others.

Ra created Shu. He was created when Ra said, “Shu the moisture”, and then Shu was sneezed out of Ra’s nostrils. There are many creation myths about how Ra was born. For example, an egg that hatched created Ra. Shu was one of the first deities.

Malabo is the capital city of Equatorial Guinea. It is located on the northern coast of Bioko Island. Its population has grown quickly over the past ten years to about 100,000. 

Notable buildings in Malabo include Malabo Cathedral and the Malabo Court Building. The city is served by Malabo International Airport, while ferries sail from its port to Douala and Bata.

The city was first founded by the British in 1827. They paid Spain for use of the island during colonial times. The British named the city Port Clarence. It was used as a naval station help stop the slave trade. Many newly freed slaves settled there before the creation of Sierra Leone as a colony for freed slaves. While many of them later moved to Sierra Leone. 

When the island returned to Spanish control, Malabo was renamed Santa Isabel. It replaced the town of Bata as the capital of the country in 1969. The city was renamed Malabo in 1973 because President Francisco Macías Nguema wanted to replace European place names with "authentic" African ones.

A shield volcano is a large volcano with shallowly-sloping sides. The name derives from a translation of "Skjaldbreiður", an Icelandic shield volcano whose name means "broad shield," from its resemblance to a warrior's shield. 

Shield volcanoes are formed by lava that flows easily. Consequently, a volcanic mountain having a broad profile is built up over time by flow after flow of relatively fluid basaltic lava issuing from vents or fissures on the surface of the volcano. Many of the largest volcanoes on Earth are shield volcanoes. 

The largest is Mauna Loa on the Big Island of Hawaii. Shield volcanoes can be so large they are sometimes considered a mountain range, such as the Ilgachuz Range and the Rainbow Range, both of which are located in Canada. These shield volcanoes formed when the North American Plate moved over a hotspot similar to the one feeding the Hawaiian Islands, called the Anahim hotspot. There are also shield volcanoes, for example, in Washington, Oregon, and the Galapagos Islands. The Piton de la Fournaise, on Reunion Island, is one of the more active shield volcanoes on earth, with one eruption per year on average.

Shield volcanoes are known to form on other planets. The largest known mountain in the solar system, Olympus Mons on Mars, is a shield volcano thought to be extinct. Shield volcanoes on Mars are higher and much more massive than those on Earth. However, we do not know if they will erupt again or when.

On Earth, because of plate tectonics, hotspot volcanoes eventually move away from the source of their magma and the volcanoes are individually less massive than might otherwise be the case. Shield volcanoes usually occur along constructive boundaries or above hotspots. However, the numerous large shield volcanoes of the Cascade Range of northern California and Oregon are over a more complex environment.

Software bug

A software bug is a problem with the code in a computer program which makes it not work properly. They can cause inconvenience to the user and may make their computer crash or freeze.

Most bugs are caused by bad programming by the developer, but sometimes they can be caused by compiler problems. When bugs are found, people send bug reports to the developer to tell them about the bug and let them fix it.

Sometimes, people say that their computer has a bug when something is wrong with it. The problem is usually caused by a computer virus which has infected their computer and is making it slow or do different things.

Pentecostalism

Pentecostalism is a movement within Evangelical Christianity that places special emphasis on the direct personal experience of God through the baptism of the Holy Spirit (), as shown in the Biblical account of the Day of Pentecost. Pentecostalism is similar to the Charismatic movement, but developed earlier and separated from the mainstream church. Charismatic Christians, at least in the early days of the movement, tended to remain in their respective denominations.

There are three basic streams of Pentecostal churches. The majority believe that one must be saved by believing in Jesus as Lord and Savior for the forgiveness of sins and to be made acceptable to God. Pentecostals also typically believe, like most other evangelicals, that the Bible has definitive authority in matters of faith. To this first group, speaking in tongues is the sign of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit and is not related to a person's salvation. This majority group believes that the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is a supernatural empowerment for ministry that only comes upon someone after they have become a Christian. The other two groups fall under an "" based salvation message which says that a person needs to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, and then receive the Holy Spirit(Holy Ghost). In that understanding receiving the Holy Spirit is necessary for salvation and includes speaking in tongues. Of the Acts 2:38 based churches, they fall into four categories of "Jesus Name", "First", "United" or "Oneness" Pentecostals which baptize in Jesus name only, and those that baptize in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

Because many Pentecostal denominations come from Methodism and the Methodist Holiness Movement, Pentecostal soteriology is generally Arminian rather than Calvinist, believing that the ability to believe in Jesus is a power of the human free will.

See also: List of Christian denominations by number of members<br> This list indicates that there may be 150 million Pentecostals. The largest Pentecostal denominations are:

While not as large as some of the above organizations the following have made quite an impact on Pentecostalism:

Niamey is the capital city of the African country of Niger. It is Niger's largest city. The city is located on the Niger River. Naimey is the administrative, cultural and economic center of the country. The city has a population of 674,950 people.
The city is located in a pearl millet growing region. Manufacturing industries in the city include bricks, ceramic goods, cement and weaving.

Niamey was probably founded during the 18th century. It was of little importance until the French created a colonial post there in the 1890s. The city grew quickly after that happened. In 1926, it became the capital of Niger. The population grew slowly from about 3,000 people in 1930 to around 30,000 in 1960, 250,000 in 1980 and 675,000 in 2002. The major cause of the increase has been immigration during droughts.

Things to see in the city include the Niger National Museum. The museum includes a zoo, a museum of vernacular architecture, a craft centre, and displays including dinosaur skeletons and the Tree of Ténéré. The city also has American, French and Nigerien cultural centres, two major markets, and a traditional wrestling arena .

The city is the site of Diori Hamani International Airport, the National School of Administration, and Abdou Moumouni University of Niamey.

Basic Roman

The Basic Roman spelling of English is a 2002 proposal for regular English spelling. It is based on five principles:






The Basic Roman system serves no particular standard of English pronunciation. Instead, it gives one way to spell the different varieties of English. The system uses 22 Roman letters to represent the set of English phonemes considered by J.C. Wells. The letters ‘j’, ‘q’, ‘w’ and ‘x’ are not used (letters ‘j’ and ‘w’ are used in an extended version of the Basic Roman spelling, see below).

By way of illustration, the following reference text by V. Yule is given in traditional spelling and in Basic Roman (shown is the non-rhotic version; in the rhotic one, relevant words like ‘daughter’, ‘heart’, ‘pictures’ etc. are spelled ‘dootar’, ‘haart’, ‘pikcharz’ etc.):

A more elaborate version of the system is the Extended Basic Roman spelling of English, which uses also the letters ‘j’ and ‘w’, and has two specific two-letter combinations for the English voiced and voiceless dental fricatives. The above sample text would appear in Extended Basic Roman (non-rhotic version) as follows:

The Extended Basic Roman is close to one-to-one phoneme-grapheme correspondence, paving the way to a pronunciation respelling for English by means of the closely related Roman Phonetic Alphabet for English.

The Roman Phonetic Alphabet for English is a system based on the Extended Basic Roman spelling of English. It includes two pairs of stress marks which disambiguate words which share the same spelling but have different meanings. This is to get a one-to-one phoneme (sound)–grapheme (spelling) correspondence. The system has certain similarities to the systems of the NBC Handbook of Pronunciation, the Carnegie Mellon version of Arpabet alphabet, and the World Book Dictionary.

Primary stress is indicated by the mark <’>, respectively <”> in the case of \\ and \\. Secondary stress is shown by <,> and <„> respectively. Stress marks are placed before the syllables concerned.

By way of illustration, the following reference text by V. Yule is given in traditional English spelling and in Roman Phonetic Alphabet transcription (non-rhotic version):

Buto originally was two cities, Pe and Dep, which merged into one city that the Egyptians named Per-Wadjet. The goddess Wadjet was its local goddess, often represented as a cobra, and she was considered the patron deity of Lower Egypt. 

The city was an important site in Ancient Egypt since more than ten thousand years. Archaeological evidence shows that Upper Egyptian culture replaced the Buto-culture at the delta when Upper and Lower Egypt were unified. 

The Greek historians told that town was celebrated for its temple and oracle of the goddess Wadjet.

Scribe

A scribe is an ancient occupation. A scribe's job involved reading and writing, especially during the Renaissance. Being a scribe meant writing letters, and historical records for kings, nobility, and temples. Later, it changed into being clerks: public servants, journalists, accountants and lawyers. Today, there are no scribes, but there are still authors and writers. 

The Ancient Egyptian scribe was an important job. Ancient Egypt also had its painters and artisans who decorated tombs, buildings, furniture, statues, and other relics with pictures and hieroglyphics. In Ancient Egypt, only males could be scribes. This was so in many civilisations, because most official positions were exclusively male.
The scribes had to be able to write not only the hieroglyphs, but also the hieratic (priestly) script, and they had to know arithmetic. They used a type of paper called papyrus, made from reeds, and wrote with reed pens and ink.

<doc id="61961" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61961" title="Ascension">
Ascension

Ascension is a Christian holiday. The word "ascension" means "going up". According to the story told in the Bible, Jesus ascended (went up) to heaven with his apostles. The holiday is celebrated forty days after his resurrection. The story tells that Jesus' body went to heaven, and that in heaven he sits at the right-hand side of God the Father.

Ascension Day is officially celebrated on a Thursday. However, not all countries hold the feast on this day. The feast is one of the ecumenical feasts. All Christians celebrate this feast, much like Easter and Pentecost. It is a very important feast in the calendar of the Christian Church. 

The Epistle to the Romans is a book from the Bible which was written about the year 56 or 57. In it, Paul describes Christ as in heaven and in the abyss. This seems to be the earliest Christian reference to Jesus in heaven. 

One of the most important texts about the "Ascension" is in the Acts of the Apostles . According to the two-source hypothesis it is also the earliest. There Jesus is taken up bodily into heaven forty days after his resurrection. The text says that the apostles saw this happening. Before going into heaven, Jesus gave a speech called the Great Commission, in which he said that he would return. In the Gospel of Luke, the "Ascension" takes place on Easter Sunday evening. The Gospel of John (c. 90-100) talks about Jesus returning to the Father. In 1 Peter (c. 90-110), Jesus has ascended to heaven and is at God's right side. Ephesians (c. 90-100) refers to Jesus ascending higher than all the heavens. First Timothy (c. 90-140) describes Jesus as taken up in glory. The traditional ending in the Book of Mark (see Mark 16) includes a short version of what Luke had said about the resurrection. It describes Jesus as being taken up into heaven and sitting at God's right hand. The way that Christ's Ascension is described is similar to the general description of his welcome in heaven, a description that comes from Hebrew scripture. The picture of Jesus rising bodily into the heavens fits in with the old traditional idea that heaven was above the earth.

There are texts that are not in the Bible that also speak about ascension, for example "Pistis Sophia".
In his text "Against Heresies", Irenaeus tells about the Gnostic view that the Ascension happened eighteen months after the Resurrection. The apocryphal text known as the "Apocryphon of James" describes the teachings of Jesus to James and Peter 550 days after the resurrection, but before the ascension. This text suggests an even longer period. The recently discovered Nag Hammadi "Gospel of Thomas", like the canonical Gospel of Matthew, does not mention the Ascension.

The feast of the Ascension has been celebrated for many centuries. Although we do not have anything in writing about it before the beginning of the fifth century, St. Augustine says that it is of Apostolic origin, and he speaks of it in a way that shows that all Christians celebrated it long before his time (he lived from 354-430).

"Christ's ascension" is mentioned in the original Nicene Creed. This text has been important to Christians ever since it was made in 325. It is included in the Mass. It is also mentioned in the Apostles' Creed. It is important for Christian belief because it shows that Jesus' humanity was taken into Heaven. "Ascension Day" is one of the chief feasts of the Christian year. There is plenty of evidence that shows that the feast dates back at least to the later 300s.

The canonical story of Jesus ascending bodily into the clouds is different from the gnostic tradition, by which Jesus was said to transcend the bodily world and return to his home in the spirit world. It also contrasts with Docetic beliefs, by which matter is basically evil and Jesus was said to have been pure spirit.

Scholars of the historical Jesus think that New Testament accounts of Jesus' resurrection were stories that were invented by the apostolic-era Christian community. Some describe the Ascension as a convenient way to disagree with ongoing appearance claims in the Christian community.

He died less than a year after being elected. His widow, Isabel took his place, which made the first woman to be the head of a country's government in the Western hemisphere.

He was very popular among the working class because before him the workers had few politicians that cared about him. He required businesses to pay decent wages and safe conditions. He also did other social reforms, but also was pretty controlling. He controlled what could be said over the radio and sent people opposing him to jail. He also controlled unions and businesses, so although they had power, the government had last word.

Kashrut (, pronounced to rhyme with "wash-ROOT"; usually translated as Kosher) is the name Jews give to the laws about the kind of food that they may eat. Their holy books specify certain kinds of food that are all right to eat, and that other kinds should not be eaten. 

The Kashrut laws say that products classified as meat must not be eaten in the same meal with dairy products. Fish, fruit, and vegetables are considered neutral, called "pareve" (pronounced "PAR-veh"), and may be eaten with either meat or dairy meals. Jews who "keep kosher" have separate utensils for meat and dairy foods, and wait a number of hours after eating one type of food before eating the other type.

The meat of some animals may not be eaten at all. Animals whose meat may be eaten must be killed in a special, careful way by a religiously trained slaughterer. Meat that is not fit to eat is called "treif" (pronounced TRAYf).

Members of the NoD included Rocky Maivia (The Rock), Crush, Savio Vega, D'Lo Brown, Ahmed Johnson, Kama Mustafa, Mark Henry and Owen Hart. The NoD separated in October of 1998.

The NoD fought mainly against Degeneration X, led by Triple H.

Emperor Go-Sanjō

Emperor Go-Sanjō (September 3, 1034 - June 15, 1073) was the 71st emperor of Japan. He ruled from the year 1068 to January 18, 1073.

He was the second son of Emperor Go-Suzaku, and his mother was Empress Sadako, the third daughter of Emperor Sanjō. This made him the first Emperor in 170 years whose mother was not of the Fujiwara family.

The Japanese era names (nengō") of his reign are called:

Emperor Jimmu

No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty. 

Jimmu is almost certainly a legend. The "Kojiki" and "Nihonshoki" records his name and genealogy. Jimmu is regarded as a direct descendant of the Shinto sun goddess, Amaterasu.

The absence of information about Jimmu does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei (509?-571). 

This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Jimmu. 

The actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") in Kashihara at Nara. The mausoleum is located a short distance from Kashihara Shrine.

In 1872, the Meiji government declared that February 11, 660 BC was the exact date on which the reign of Jimmu began. This was identified as the start of the Japanese nation. 

This mythical date was commemorated as the holiday "Kigensetsu" ("Era Day"). 

This national holiday was celebrated from 1872 to 1948.
The "Kigensetsu" events in 1940 were special. They celebrated what was then to have been 2,600 years since the start of Emperor Jimmu's reign. 

After the end of the Pacific War, this holiday was ended.

Posthumous name

A posthumous name is an honorary name given to someone after their death. This type of name was common with naming royalty in the countries of Japan and China. They were also sometimes used in Vietnam and Korea.

This idea was created during the Zhou Dynasty in China. The first person to be named in this way was Ji Chang, named by his son. His son, Ji Fa of Zhou, called his father the "Civil King". This meant that he found his father to be good and sympathetic to the people he ruled. 

These sort of names were not used during the Qin Dynasty. During that time, these names were not thought to show respect. Posthumous names were used again during the Han Dynasty.

Chinese posthumous names, for rulers, end in one or both symbols for "emperor", "Huángdì". This can be shortened to "Dì".

These names were sometimes very long. They can be good names or bad. Good names are called respectful names (or "zūn hào" in Chinese). Some of these names are:

The posthumous names of Japanese emperors are called "teigō". Some names are given a long time after their death. Others are given right after the emperor had died.

Some of these names tell about the place they were born or lived in, or traits they had that their people admired. 

Some also put together two previous emperors' or empresses' names, like Empress Meishō. The empresses before her were called Gemmei and Genshō. So her name became Meishō.

You Can't Do That on Television

You Can't Do That on Television (YCDTOTV) is a Canadian children's television program. It was created by Roger Price and produced from 1979 until 1990. It mostly featured child actors in a sketch comedy format, acting out short scenes based on a theme that served as the topic for the episode. Connecting scenes based on the theme would often serve to create a story arc that lasted the length of the episode. Nickelodeon became known for its iconic green slime that was originally used in this show. The series is known also because future pop recording artist Alanis Morissette was in it as a cast member at some time.

In 2002, and again in 2004, YCDTOTV cast members reunited alongside fans of the show at SlimeCon, a fan-produced convention in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. YCDTOTV was a children's comedy show. Some people see it as a nostalgic cult classic. During the 2004 event, a "Top Secret" reunion special had its premiere.

Nouakchott

Nouakchott (Arabic: نواكشوط or انواكشوط) is the capital city of the n county of Mauritania. It is the largest city in that country and one of the largest cities on the Sahara Desert. The city is the administrative and economic centre of Mauritania. The Arabic name is said to mean "The place of winds" in the language of the Berber people.

The city is often a place where the urban Mauritanians and the nomadic people of the area can interact.

The population of Nouakchott is about 881,000 people. It is hard to know exactly how many people live in the city because many of them are nomadic. They find a good place to live, set up their tent for a short time and then move to somewhere else.

Although Islam is the state religion in Mauritania, Nouakchott includes the Cathedral of St. Joseph, a Catholic cathedral.

Nouakchott has a deep-sea port. It was opened in 1986. The port is mainly used for imports. The city also features an international airport. The city is home to the Université de Nouakchott. It is the only university in Mauritania. Things to see in Nouakchott include Nouakchott Museum, several markets including Nouakchott Silver Market, and the beaches.

Nouakchott has very little history. It was a tiny fishing town until 1958. It is possible that the Berber Muslim Almoravids came from the area. The city was selected as the capital city for its mild climate and its location near the center of the country.

Mauritania was part of the larger French colony of French West Africa. During that time, Saint-Louis, in Senegal was the capital. In 1957, this small port town was chosen to be the capital of the new country. A building program was begun to grow its population to 15,000. In 1962, Nouakchott became the capital of an independent country.

The city has much growth. Because of the north African drought since the beginning of the 1970s many people have moved to the city.

Nouakchott is located on the Atlantic coast of the Sahara Desert. The city is very spread out. It has only a few tall buildings. 

Nouakchott is built around a large tree-lined street, Avenue Abd an-Nasir. This street runs northeast through the city center from the airport. Other major streets are named (in French) for notable Mauritanian people, or international people of the 1960s: Avenue de Gaulle, Avenue Kennedy, and Avenue Lumumba, for example.

Temperatures range between 33°C (92°F) and 13 °C (56 °F). The average rainfall is 178mm (7in) a year.

Saint Nicholas

Saint Nicholas (270–6 December 343), or Nikolaos of Myra, was the Bishop of Myra. 

He was born in the Greek colony of Patara, in Asia Minor. Myra is near Antalya, in modern-day Turkey.

In the 11th century, his remains were taken to Bari, Italy, to save them from Turkish (Muslim) invaders. 

He is the patron saint of very many groups, including thieves and murderers. So far as is known, what he did in that respect was to protect the "falsely accused".

He is venerated in both Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Churches.

His parents were relatively well-off. Nicholas is said to have distributed his fortune among the poor. This is relatively well documented. Less documented deeds of his include saving children from drowning. Nicholas saved young girls from being made prostitutes (because their fathers did not have the money for a dowry). He helped seamen in a storm and saved a child that was abducted.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Saint Nicholas of Myra is a very prominent figure. Very often, the third large icon on the Iconostasis in Orthodox churches is devoted to him. The other two are usually devoted to Jesus, and to Mary with the child.

The modern composer Benjamin Britten composed a cantata for orchestra and choir about the life of St. Nicholas. It is very popular and often performed.

He is the Saint behind Santa Claus. He is the patron Saint of Children, of Seafarers and merchants. The Hanseatic League chose him as their patron saint. Over 400 churches and several thousands all over the world are named after Nicholas of Myra. He is also the patron saint of both Amsterdam, capital of Netherlands and Moscow, capital of Russia.

Wikipedia:Requirements for very good articles

There are many articles in Simple English Wikipedia. Some of them are better than others. To mark those articles that can be an example for how articles should be, a template has been set up. This template is called . It can be added to articles that meet the requirements listed below, and that have been voted on by the community. In other Wikipedia projects, such articles are called "Featured articles".


To be able to mark a certain article very good, there is a certain procedure that should be followed.

Because the process of becoming a very good article is long, larger edits (beyond spellchecking/link-fixing) to current very good articles should be talked about on the talk page of the article before they are made.

Sometimes a very good article is changed in such a way that it no longer meets the criteria above, or new information may become available about the topic, making the article incomplete. In such a case, the article should be demoted from very good article status. Demotion of a VGA can be done in this way:

Wikipedia:Proposed very good articles/Archive 1

While this article has a few lingering red links left, overall the article has the potential to warrant for the VGA tag. -- 02:50, 3 October 2007 (UTC)

I created another article that could be almost rready for the VGA tag. While most of the article is completed, it still contains a few red links, although some copyediting would also help the article. -- 21:07, 23 September 2007 (UTC)

Based on my opinion, I think this article could warrant the VGA tag since after a quick scan, most of the article seems ready to qualify. But proofreading from other editors could also help the article. -- 02:14, 13 September 2007 (UTC)

I think that this could become a VG article, it's more of a story that an article, but it has sufficient information whilst not going into too much detail (IMO!). <br>
Edit away! <br>

It's a difficult subject to express in simple English, but I think I've managed fairly well. 


Well, see what you think! 20:39, 11 September 2007 (UTC)

So, d'ye think this is ready for voting? 09:23, 18 September 2007 (UTC)

The latest project I've been working on. After several days of research, writing and copyediting, filling red links, and simplifying the very long and complex topic, I feel it's ready to be reviewed. Comments, thoughts and more are extremely welcome! - 06:08, 31 August 2007 (UTC)


This article seems to give a lot of detailed information on tropical cyclones while at the same time it uses simple english. It looks like a great article overall. -- 17:01, 23 June 2007 (UTC)

This article has quite a number of red links. It should be fixed first. ( ▪ ) 11:14, 4 July 2007 (UTC)

I think this article meets more than half the criteria. I do realise that I did most of the work, but while this is pvgood, other people can edit it. -- 15:37, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

I've worked on this for a while, it was a really interesting subject and I think it could become a VG article after being sweeped a couple of times by other users. It covers most of the criteria and there are no red links but only four references. I'll let you guys decide. <br>

After some days of research and work, here's the tentatively final version of this article. The subject is extremely complex, like so many things in Japanese culture, so keeping it brief has been a daunting task. Fortunately, with 1,900 words, I feel it's pretty complete, yet well within our length standards. I've consulted several sources in different languages to try and write something deeper than its EnWP counterpart, and I'm satisfied with the results. Of course, it still doesn't comply with guideline 3, since so far only I have edited it; so your reviews are most welcome. Thank you all! :) - 20:43, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

I think this article seems to be almost ready for the VGA tag since it covers most of the basic requirements of a VG article. But unlike the tropical cyclone article, it contains no dreaded red links with the exception of the template which still has two red links leftover. -- 07:21, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

I've done most of the work to this article, but it meets the other criteria. Does it need anything? · 20:33, 16 July 2007 (UTC)

Here's another candidate for a very good article. -- 04:24, 19 July 2007 (UTC)

I worked hard on this article, it is about 2300 words long and I think that it meets most of the criteria. There is still one red link that I am working on to fix, and there may be a few things that I have missed out. But I think that it could get that "Very Good Article" stamp on the top with a few revisions.<br>



I worked very hard on this article for a long time, and I think it is coming close to meeting the good article criteria. I had to create something like 20 to 30 new articles to fill in the red links, still have a few more to go. Other than that, I hope people can have a look at the article at its current status and comment. Constructive criticism is welcome. Thank you. 13:02, 30 July 2007 (UTC)



I have made Caffeine and Japanese tea ceremony into the first two very good articles, and removed the tag from the others, that is Alanis Morissette, Chocolate, Malaria, Atlana, Georgia, Bob Dylan, Devon, Equinox, Ernest Hemingway and Fencing. They can be re-listed (and voted on) here once they meet the criteria. This means I officially started the process. Yay. :) -- 21:32, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

The article on chopsticks are almost good enough to be on the "good articles" list. It still needs some information on history. 20:36, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

Just stumbled upon the article about Pope John Paul II. It looks quite simple, has had a number of revisions, but still about 3 redlinks left (to other Popes, and one person I do not know). IMO is a candidate that can be made very good with little work. -- 20:26, 21 June 2007 (UTC)

I've just expanded on this article and added some references. Looked at the requirements and I think it meets at least five of them. I don't know what more I could do, but I don't think there is a lot more left to do. What else can I add to become a VG article? 10:52, 27 June 2007 (UTC)

The 11 articles that are currently in the category seem to have been added without community discussion. I think they should have to follow we now have in place for "very good articles". Please make comments on whether you think they should be kept as "very good articles". The 11 articles are:
· 20:05, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

I would vote to keep Bob Dylan and Equinox and remove the rest. - 20:10, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
To sum up the current status, the probably first few true "very good articles" could be "Alanis Morisette", "Atlanta", "Caffeine", "Chocolate","Japanese Tea Ceremony", and "Malaria". This can be done with a relatively small effort. -- 09:39, 6 April 2007 (UTC)
My opinion of a very good article would be an article that is essentially complete, an article that doesn't have much room for improvement at all. It think that when considering the length of an article that we should keep in mind the length that it "could" be. I feel like there is a lot more information that can be added to all of the articles. The exception to that is "Malaria", which I think might need to be gone over to make sure that all the information is encyclopedic and remove/reword parts that are not (for example, the wording in the "How to prevent malaria" section could be improved.) That being said, I would say that the best articles on the list are "Alanis Morisette", "Caffeine", "Japanese Tea Ceremony", and "Malaria". Do I think that any of them are yet worthy of being marked as "very good articles"? I still have not decided. I really want to feel confident that we are putting our best articles on display. I will do some more thinking before giving my decision. · 14:58, 6 April 2007 (UTC)
I propose that the following articles should keep the "very good articles" tag, and that it should be removed from all others:
The following articles would therefore no longer be classified as "very good":

There has been some controversy regarding this, namely whether using LSD once increases the risk of getting cancer or mutations of genetic material. See for more on the controversy. Nevertheless, I fixed the few redlinks that remained, and I am now proposing the article for a vote. Please do not be afraid to oppose it. "Very good article" should be a tag attached to articles that are worth the tag. It might well be that this one is not. -- 12:21, 22 September 2007 (UTC)

I faced it while I was working on uncategorized pages. I added cat and interwiki, and now it is almost there, I think. - 16:33, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

I've done nearly all the work here on this article which seems to meet at least half of the criteria, although my guess was 7 out of the 10 criteria. I've revised most of the article. The only thing it possibly needs is some reviewing from other editors. -- 19:27, 18 July 2007 (UTC)

The latest projecty I've been working on. After getting valuable input from Huji and Gwib, and polishing the last minor details, I feel (hope) it's worthy of the VG tag. I hereby submit it for your consideration. - 17:46, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

I've recently read the article and I found the work to be wuite outstanding. So I decided to move this over here since the article gives clear basic information, has references, and no red links. Good work ! Cheers, -- 23:20, 18 August 2007 (UTC)

In the last few days, I've worked hard on this article, researching, doublechecking with Japanese sources, writing and copyediting, and filling more than 30 red links. While the basic structure is similar to its JaWP counterpart (upon which all other Wikipedias' entries are built), I've added a great number of relevant facts, historical and cultural, and rewritten the article completely. As it happens in these cases, I feel that the only guideline it doesn't comply is, not having been edited by others (yet). However, I'd like to submit it as a candidate, because I think that, with your constructive criticism, it may be worthy of the precious VG tag. In fact, I'm very happy to say, we have now an article on the subject that is longer, more informative and comprehensive, and better referenced and illustrated than any other Wikipedia.

Model (person)

A model is a person who has the job of using their body to pose for art, or to show fashion items, such as clothes or jewellery. Models often appear in advertising on television and in print media, for example newspapers and magazines, or on the web.

There are many different types of models. Some models only use certain parts of their bodies. For example, a "hand model" is a person who only uses their hands. A hand model would be used to display certain items, for example rings and watches. These models are mostly used for advertisements.
Fashion models are used to sell clothing or cosmetics. People who make clothing will often use fashion models to wear the clothing they make at fashion shows. The models will walk up and down a raised section of floor called the catwalk or "runway" to show the clothing to other people. Some exclusive 'fashion houses' also use models to show off their dresses to clients. This idea was invented by Charles Worth.

Photographers can use models for several situations, which can be grouped into the following categories, advertising, editorial and personal/portfolio work. Within these groups, work can involve fine art, fashion, fitness and glamour, to name but a few. Some photographers may ask models to express different moods or feeling for pictures.

Models can be all shapes and sizes, both men and women. Models do not have to be size zero, though most are young, good-looking females. Some models are 'plus-size' models and are of a larger build.

The first person described to be as a fashion model was Parisian shopgirl, Marie Vernet Worth. She was a 'house' model in 1852, for her fashion designer husband at the "haute couture" House of Worth.

Fine art models are hired by photographers, painters, sculptors and other artists to pose for their art.
Models are frequently used during art classes, but are also employed by professional artists. The most common types of art created using models are figure drawing and painting, sculpture and photography. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in advertising, its 'artwork' commonly employs models.

Throughout the history of Western art, drawing the human figure from life was considered the best way to develop the skill of drawing. In the art school classroom setting, there are no real limitations on who the model can be. In some cases, the model may pose with various props, one or more other models, animals etc., against real or artificial background, in natural or artificial light and so on.

Models for life drawing classes are often nude, apart from visually non-obstructive personal items such as small jewellery and sometimes eyeglasses. This may be referred to as being 'undraped' or 'disrobed'.

Models typically work in one of two ways:

Religion of Ancient Egypt

The Religion of ancient Egypt had followers for over three thousand years, until the Egyptian people turned to Coptic Christianity and Islam.

At the beginning, there were five different religious groups of people in Egypt. Each groups had different beliefs, and were based in different places.
During the history of Egypt, the beliefs changed with the leader. When someone rose in power, their belief system rose as well. The new beliefs would combined with the beliefs that were already there. This happened even after the end of the ancient Egyptian civilization as it is known today. An example of this might be the "New Kingdom". During its time, the gods Ra and Amun, became Amun-Ra. Joining to create one god is usually referred to as syncretism. 

The Egyptians believed that in the beginning, the universe was filled with the dark waters of chaos. The first god, Re-Atum, came from the water. Re-Atum spat and this created the gods Shu (god of air) and Tefnut (goddess of moisture). The world was created when Shu and Tefnut gave birth to two children: Nut (goddess of the sky) and Geb (god of the Earth). Humans were created when Shu and Tefnut went walking in the darkness and got lost. Re-Atum sent his eye to find them. After finding them, his tears of joy turned into people.

Nut and Geb had sex. When Shu heard about this, he did not want them to be together. He became the air between the sky and ground. He also said that the pregnant Nut could not give birth. Nut begged Thoth to help. Thoth gambled with the moon-god Khonsu. He won five more days to be added to the 360-day year. Nut had one child on each of these days: Osiris, Isis, Set, Nephthys, and Horus-the-Elder.

Osiris was the king of Egypt. His brother, Seth, murdered him and became the king. After killing him, Seth tore the body of Osiris into pieces. Isis rescued the pieces. She wanted to bury the pieces under the temple. After Seth became king, he was fought by Horus, Osiris's son. Seth lost and was sent to the desert. Seth became the god of very bad storms. Osiris was mummified by Anubis and became God of the dead. Horus became the new king. In ancient Egypt, it was believed that the pharaohs were Horus's descendants.

The ancient Greeks believed that their gods and goddesses were the anscestors of the Egyptian gods and goddesses. In ancient Greek Mythology, when the titan Typhon was set free, all of the Greek gods (except for Hermes and Zeus) fled to Egypt. In Egypt, many of the gods made themselves turn into animals to hide themselves from Typhon. They reproduced, and the Egyptian gods and goddesses were born.
Egypt had a developed view of the afterlife with rituals for preparing the body and soul for a peaceful life after death. Beliefs about the soul and afterlife focused mainly on preserving the body. This was because they believed that the "ka" (a part of a person's soul) was still living in the body after death and it was important for the ka to be reunited with the ba, the spirit or soul to form the akh. This meant that embalming and mummification were done, in order to preserve the person's identity in the afterlife. Originally the dead were buried in reed coffins in the hot sand, which caused the remains to dry quickly, and then were buried. Later, they started constructing wooden tombs, and the long process of mummification was developed by the Egyptians around the 4th Dynasty. All soft tissues were removed, and the cavities washed and packed with natron, then the outer body was buried in natron as well.

After coming out of the natron, the bodies were coated inside and out with resin to preserve them, then wrapped with linen bandages, embedded with religious amulets and talismans. In the case of royalty, this was usually then placed inside a series of nested coffins. The outer layer of the coffins was a stone sarcophagus. The intestines, lungs, liver and the stomach were preserved separately and stored in canopic jars protected by the Four sons of Horus. Other creatures were also mummified, sometimes thought to be pets of Egyptian families, but more likely they represented the gods. They left the heart in place because they thought it was the home of the soul.

The Book of the Dead was a series of almost two hundred spells represented as texts, songs and pictures written on papyrus. They were individually customized for the dead. They were buried along with the dead to make their passage into the underworld easier. After a person dies their soul is led into a hall of judgment in Duat by Anubis (god of mummification) and the deceased's heart, which was the record of the morality of the owner, is weighed against a single feather representing Ma'at (the concept of truth, and order). A heart that weighed less than the feather was considered a pure heart. This resulted in a good outcome. A heart heavy with guilt and sin from one's life weighed more than the feather, and so the heart would be eaten by Ammit ("Eater of Hearts")–part crocodile, part lion, and part hippopotamus. If the outcome was good, the dead are taken to Osiris, god of the afterlife, in Aaru, but the if the out come was bad, the demon Ammit destroyed their heart, leaving the owner to remain in Duat.

A short time of monotheism (Atenism) happened when Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV) was pharaoh. He focused the religion on the Egyptian sun god Aten. The Aten is usually shown as a sun disk with rays coming out of all sides. Akhenaten built a new capital at Amarna with temples for The Aten. Akhenaten's religion only lasted until his death. The old religion was quickly restored by Tutankhamun, Akhenaten's son by his wife Kiya.

While most historians say this period is monotheistic, some researchers do not. They say that people worshipped the royal family as gods who got their divine power from the Aten. In one picture, Akhenaten is shown with his wife Nefertiti with three of their 6 daughters sitting under the beams of the Aten. This point of view is mostly ignored by historians. Some researchers say that Akhenaten or some of his viziers were Moses or Joseph (Bible) from the Bible.

After the fall of the Amarna dynasty, the original Egyptian {(pantheon)} was the main religion, until the development Coptic Christianity and later Islam, even though the Egyptians continued to have relations with the other monotheistic cultures (the Hebrews). Egyptian mythology put up surprisingly little resistance to the spread of Christianity. This is sometimes explained by saying that Jesus was originally a syncretism based mainly on Horus, with Isis and her worship becoming Mary.

Kyle Broflovski

Kyle Broflovski (sometimes called as Brovlofski or Broflofski) is a fictional character in the animated television series "South Park". He is voiced by and influenced by Matt Stone, one of the people who made the show. Kyle is one of the four main characters. The other three main characters are Stan Marsh, Kenny McCormick, and Eric Cartman. He is friends with Stan and Kenny. They are all in fourth grade. They all hang out with Eric Cartman. They do not like him because he can be mean and offensive. Kyle usually acts as the protagonist to Cartman's antagonist. Because Kyle is one of the few Jewish children on the show, he sometimes feels like an between the main group of characters.

Kyle lives with his family in the fictional town of South Park, Colorado. He has an adopted brother named Ike. Ike is from Canada. Both Kyle and Ike are Jewish. Kyle is one of the smartest students in the fourth grade class at his elementary school. Cartman usually makes fun of Kyle because he is Jewish.

Keeping with the animation style of South Park, Kyle is created from simple geometrical shapes. He is not given the same free range of motion like characters that are drawn by hand. In one of the earliest episodes, he was created out of construction paper cutouts and animated with the use of stop motion. Kyle is now animated with computer software. He is shown to give the sense that the show still uses the original animation technique.

Kyle wears a bright green cap with ear flaps (shapka or bomber-hat), a bright orange jacket, dark green pants, and lime-green mittens or gloves. When he is not seen wearing his cap (which does not happen very often), he is shown to have a bright red-to-auburn Jewfro. He does not like this hairstyle.

Kyle's father, Gerald is a caring parent to Kyle who usually tries to teach him important morals and ethics. His mother, Sheila is a very overprotective and has a knack for fequently protesting in things that opposes or comes across her ideas or beliefs. Even though her personality sometimes bothers Kyle, he is known to have still loved her and would come to here defense when Cartman would make fun of Kyle's mom. Sheila is based on the stereotype about Jewish mothers. Kyle usually has a good relationship with his parents, although he sometimes would rebel against them.

Kyle also has one brother, Ike. Ike is his younger brother who was adopted from Canada. In the earlier episodes of the series, Kyle sometimes played a game he called "kick the baby", where he would punt Ike into the air. Kyle is shown to be caring for Ike and tries to protect him several times. In addition to his regular family, Kyle has a cousin who shares the same name with him. However, Kyle did not seem to like his cousin and tried to send him away several times.

Armenian Apostolic Church

The Armenian Apostolic Church (Armenian: Հայ Առաքելական Եկեղեցի), also called the Armenian Orthodox Church or the Gregorian Church, is the world's oldest national church and one of the most ancient Christian communities .

The earliest Christian accounts of the introduction of Christianity into Armenia date from the 1st century. The Church teaches that it was first preached by two Apostles of Jesus, St. Thaddeus and St. Bartholomew. The Armenian Apostolic Church claims to been in existence since the days of the apostles and therefore would be one of the oldest denominations of Christianity. Armenia was the first country to adopt Christianity as its official religion, when St. Gregory the Illuminator converted Tiridates III (the King of Armenia) and members of his court , traditionally dated to 301 (after Mikayel Chamchian 1784). The Church teaches that St. Gregory was imprisoned by Tiridates in an underground pit, called Khor Virab, for 13 years, after which he healed the King of an incurable disease, whereupon Tiridates accepted Christianity.

National church

The term national church is usually a reference to a church organization in Christianity that claims pastoral jurisdiction over a nation. The term should not be confused with established church (state church): a national church differs from a state church in that a national church does not necessarily need to be officially endorsed by the state, and even may be persecuted by the government (as Orthodox churches were persecuted under communist regimes).

The term national church (or "independent church") is used a lot within, but is not shortened to, the Anglican Communion and Orthodox Christianity. For example, the Episcopal Church in the United States of America considers itself to be the national church of the United States.

In Catholicism, the term national church might mean to a parish catering to immigrants from another nation.

Urartu (Assyrian "Urarṭu", Urartian "Biainili") was an ancient kingdom in Armenia located in the mountainous plateau between Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and Caucasus mountains, later known as the Armenian Highland, and it centered around Lake Van (present-day eastern Turkey). The kingdom existed from ca. 860 BC, emerging from Late Bronze Age Nairi polities, until 585 BC. The name corresponds to the Biblical Ararat.

Urartu extended from Lake Van southeastward to Mannai, and sometimes even included that land as one of its provinces.

The lake was the centre of the Urartian kingdom from about 1000 BC, and the capital of Urartu, Tushpa, was on the shore of Lake Van (on the site of the medieval castle of Van, west of Van city).

Later the land around the lake was ruled by Armenians. Along with Lake Sevan in today's Armenia and Lake Urmia in today's Iran, Van was one of the three great lakes of the Armenian Kingdom, referred to as "the seas of Armenia".

Annual plant

In Botany, an annual plant is a plant that usually germinates, flowers and dies in one year. True annuals will only live longer than a year if they are prevented from setting seed. Some seedless plants can also be considered annuals even though they do not flower.

In gardening, annual often refers to a plant grown outdoors in the spring and summer and surviving just for one growing season. 
Many food plants are, or are grown as, annuals, including most domesticated grains. Some perennials and biennials are grown in gardens as annuals for convenience, particularly if they are not considered cold hardy for the local climate. Carrot, celery and parsley are true biennials that are usually grown as annual crops for their edible roots, petioles and leaves, respectively. Tomato, sweet potato and bell pepper are tender perennials usually grown as annuals.

Ornamental annuals are often called bedding plants. Annuals are often used in gardens to provide splashes of color, as they tend to have a longer season of bloom than hardy herbaceous perennials. 

Examples of true annuals include corn, lettuce, pea, cauliflower, watermelon, bean, zinnia and marigold.

Summer annuals sprout, flower and die within the same spring/summer/fall. The lawn weed, crabgrass, is a summer annual

<doc id="62110" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62110" title="Pea">
Pea

A pea, although treated as a vegetable in cooking, is botanically a fruit; the term is most commonly used to describe the small spherical seeds or the pods of the legume Pisum sativum. This was the original model organism used by Gregor Mendel in his early work on genetics. 

The name is also used to describe other edible seeds from the Fabaceae like the pigeon pea ("Cajanus cajan"), the cowpea ("Vigna unguiculata")and the seeds from several species of "Lathyrus".

"P. sativum" is an annual plant. It is a cool season crop, planted in winter. The average pea weighs between 0.1 and 0.36 grams. The species is as a fresh vegetable, but is also grown to produce dry peas like the split pea. These varieties are typically called field peas.

"P. sativum" has been cultivated for thousands of years, the sites of cultivation have been described in southern Syria and southeastern Turkey, and some argue that the cultivation of peas with wheat and barley seems to be associated with the spread of Neolithic agriculture into Europe.

It is a cool-season vegetable crop. The seeds may be planted as soon as the soil temperature reaches 10 °C, with the plants growing best at temperatures of 13 °C to 18 °C. They do not thrive in the summer heat of warmer temperate and lowland tropical climates, but do grow well in cooler high altitude tropical areas. Peas grow best in slightly acid, well-drained soils.

Several varieties of "P. sativum" have been bred. Widely cultivated examples include:

Fresh peas are often eaten boiled and flavored with butter and/or spearmint as a side dish vegetable. Salt is also commonly added to peas when served. Fresh peas are also used in pot pies, salads and casseroles. Pod peas (particularly sweet cultivars called "mangetout" and "sugar peas", or the flatter "snow peas," called "hé lán dòu", in Chinese) are used in stir fried dishes, particularly those in American Chinese cuisine. Pea pods do not keep well once picked, and if not used quickly are best preserved by drying, canning or freezing within a few hours of harvest.
Dried peas are often made into a soup or simply eaten on their own. In Japan and other Southeast Asian countries including Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia, the peas are roasted and salted, and eaten as snacks. In the UK, marrowfat peas are used to make pease pudding (or "pease porridge"), a traditional dish. In North America a similarly traditional dish is split pea soup.

In Chinese cuisine, pea sprouts (豆苗 "dòu miáo") are commonly used in stir-fries and its price is relatively high due to its agreeable taste.

Some forms of etiquette require that peas be only eaten with a fork and not pushed onto the fork with a knife .

<doc id="62115" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62115" title="Biennial">
Biennial

A biennial plant is a flowering plant that takes two years to complete its lifecycle. In the first year the plant grows leaves, stems, and roots (vegetative structures); then it enters a period of dormancy over the colder months. Usually, the stem remains very short and the leaves are low to the ground, forming a rosette. Many biennials require a cold treatment, before they will flower. The next spring/summer the stem of the biennial plant becomes much longer. The plant then flowers, produces fruits and seeds before it finally dies. There are far fewer biennials than either perennials or annuals.

Under extreme climatic conditions, a biennial plant may complete its lifecycle in a very short period of time (e.g. 3 or 4 months instead of 2 years). This is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were exposed to cold conditions, before they were planted in the ground. This behaviour leads to many normally biennial plants being treated as annuals in some areas.
Flowering can be induced in some biennials by application of the plant hormone "gibberellin", but this is rarely done commercially.

From a gardener's perspective, a plant's status as annual, biennial, or perennial often varies based on location or purpose. Biennials grown for flowers, fruits, or seeds need to be grown for two years. Biennials that are grown for edible leaves or roots are grown as annuals, e.g. beets, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, celery, parsley, and Swiss chard. If a normally biennial plant is grown in extremely harsh conditions, it is likely to be treated as an annual because it will not survive the winter cold. Conversely, an annual grown under extremely favourable conditions may have highly successful seed propagation, giving it the appearance of being biennial or perennial. Some short-lived perennials may appear to be biennial rather than perennial. True biennials flower only once, while many perennials will flower every year once mature.

Examples of biennial plants are parsley, "Lunaria", silverbeet, sweet William, colic weed, and carrot. The pansy is a biennial often grown as an annual. Plant breeders have produced annual cultivars of several biennials that will flower the first year from seed, e.g. foxglove, stock, and hollyhock.

Biennials may be kept alive longer than two years under environmental conditions that prevent them from flowering. Biennial sugar beet was prevented from flowering by not giving it the cold treatment required for flowering. It was kept alive in a greenhouse for 41 months.

Port Louis is the capital city of the African country of Mauritius. The city is a port on the Indian Ocean. It is the largest city and main port of the country. Port Louis is located in the Port Louis District. The city has a population of 147,688 people.

Port Louis was founded by the French around 1735. It was used as a place to supply food for their ships travelling around the Cape of Good Hope. The city was named in honour of King Louis XV. The first Governor was Count Bertrand-François Mahé de La Bourdonnais.

Port Louis has many historic and colonial buildings. One of them is a fortification named Fort Adelaide or La Citadelle. It was built by the British in 1835. Most of the city's architecture can be seen from La Citadelle. Port Louis is surrounded by a mountain range, called the Port Louis Moka Range. Other famous spots are the Police Barracks known as Les Casernes and the Port Louis Waterfront.

Other things to see in the city include the Caudan Waterfront, Port Louis Bazaar, the Mauritian Chinatown and the old Port Louis theatre. The capital has also three museums which are: the Mauritius Natural History Museum, the Blue Penny Museum and the Mauritius Stamp Museum.

The main part of the economy of Port Loius is its port. The port handles all of the international trade for the country. Clothing and textiles are the major things manufactured in the city. Chemicals, plastics, and pharmaceuticals are made there, and tourism is also important. 

Port Louis is the second most important financial center in Africa after Johannesburg. It is the city with the highest per capita income in Africa.

The population of the city is now largely made up of the descendants of people who were hired for labor from India in the 19th century. Slaves were brought to the country by the British and French who colonized the island in the 18th century. After the end of slavery in 1835, many Indian and Chinese workers were brought to work the land, and take care of sugar cane, at that time used to make rum. 

More than 75 percent of the population are Indians. The rest come from Africa, while a small number have Chinese and Eurasian ancestry.

Freetown

Freetown is the capital city of the African country of Sierra Leone. With a population of 1,070,200 people, it is the largest city in that country. The city is a port on the Freetown Peninsula on the Atlantic coast. The port is a very important part of the economy of Freetown. It handles the main exports of the country. Industries include fish, rice, petroleum, and making cigarettes.

The area was first settled in 1787 by 400 freed slaves and Black American Loyalists sent from England. Before that time it was said to be a slave market. These people created the 'Province of Freetown' on land bought from local Temne leaders. After many of these original settlers died from disease, it was burnt by the local people in 1790. 

The Sierra Leone Company tried to settle the area again in 1792. They resettled Freetown with 1,100 former slaves and Loyalists from Nova Scotia. Many of these people were born in the colonial United States. They were led by former slave Thomas Peters. Around 500 free Jamaican Maroons joined them in 1800.

The city survived being attacked by the French in 1794. In 1800 the people revolted but the British retook control. From 1808 to 1874, the city was the capital of British West Africa. The city grew quickly as many freed slaves came to live there. African soldiers who had fought for Britain in the Napoleonic Wars also came to live in Freetown. During World War II, Britain had a naval base at Freetown. Descendants of the freed slaves, called Creoles, have a large role in the city, even though they are only a small amount of the population.

The city had much fighting in the late 1990s. In 1998, it was captured by ECOWAS soldiers who were trying to make Ahmad Tejan Kabbah the President again. 
One of Freetown’s most most known features is its famous cotton tree. The cotton tree is said to have been in the same position since colonists came to the area in 1787. At that time, the tree was still a young sapling. It now stands outside the Freetown Museum.

Notable buildings in the city include Freetown Law Courts, the Slave Gate and Portuguese Steps, St John's Maroon Church (built around 1820), St George's Cathedral (completed in 1828), Foulah Town Mosque (built in the 1830s) and the Roman Catholic Sacred Heart Cathedral. Also in Freetown are many beaches and markets, and the Sierra Leone Museum.

The city is the home of Fourah Bay College and the Njala University college.

Lungi International Airport is the international airport of Sierra Leone. Freetown also has a heliport on Aberdeen Island. It connects the city with the airport. There is a helicopter, hovercraft and ferry-service from the city to the airport.

Pretoria

Pretoria is one of the three capital cities of the African country of South Africa. It is the executive (administrative) and de facto capital of the country. The other two capitals are Cape Town (legislative) and Bloemfontein (judicial). The city is in the northern part of Gauteng Province, South Africa. 

Pretoria is between the Highveld and the Bushveld, about 50 km north of Johannesburg in the north-east of South Africa. It is in a warm, well sheltered valley. The valley is surrounded by the hills of the Magaliesberg mountain range. Snow is a very rare event. It only snows in Pretoria once or twice in a century.

The city has a population of about 1.9 million people. The main languages spoken in Pretoria include Tswana, Ndebele, Afrikaans, and English. 

Nguni-speaking settlers were probably the first people to live in the river valley that later became the location of the city of Pretoria.

Pretoria itself was founded in 1855 by Marthinus Pretorius. He was a leader of the Voortrekkers. Pretoruis named the city after his father Andries Pretorius. Andries Pretorius had become a hero of the Voortrekkers after the Battle of Blood River. The city became the capital of the South African Republic (ZAR) on May 1, 1860.

During the First Boer War, the city was attacked in December 1880 and March 1881. The peace treaty which ended the war was signed in Pretoria on August 3, 1881 at the Pretoria Convention.

The Second Boer War (1899 to 1902) caused the end of the South African Republic. After this war, the United Kingdom took control of South Africa. During the war, Winston Churchill was imprisoned in the Staats Model School in Pretoria. He later got free and went to Mozambique. The city surrendered to British forces on June 5, 1900. The war ended in Pretoria with the signing of the Peace of Vereeniging on May 31 1902.

In 1910, Pretoria then became the administrative capital of all of South Africa, with Cape Town the legislative capital. Between 1860 and 1994, the city was also the capital of the province of Transvaal. On 14 October 1931, Pretoria got official city status. When South Africa became a republic in 1961, Pretoria stayed its administrative capital.

Pretoria was at one time seen as "the capital of Apartheid South Africa". This was changed when Nelson Mandela became the country's first black President.

Pretoria is an important industrial centre. It has many industries including iron and steel as well as automobile, railroad and machinery manufacture.

Bigotry

A bigot is a person who is intolerant of opinions, lifestyles, or identities that from his or her own. Mostly, his opinions are based on prejudice.

The origin of the word "bigot" in English dates back to at least 1598, via Middle French, and started with the sense of "religious hypocrite", especially a woman.
"Bigot" is often used as a pejorative term against a person who is obstinately devoted to prejudices even when these views are challenged or proven to be false. 

Forms of bigotry may have a related ideology.

The exact origin of the word is unknown, but may have come from the German "bei" and "gott", or the English "by God". William Camden wrote that the Normans were first called bigots, when their Duke Rollo, who receiving Gisla, daughter of King Charles, in marriage, and with her the investiture of the dukedom, refused to kiss the king's foot in token of subjection, unless the king would hold it out for that purpose. And being urged to it by those present, Rollo answered hastily, "No by God", whereupon the King turning about, called him "bigot"; which name passed from him to his people. This is likely fictional, however, as Gisla is unknown in Frankish sources.

The early religions in Armenia are not that well known. According to De Morgan there are signs which indicate that the Armenians, as their other Aryan relatives, were initially nature worshipers and that this faith in time was transformed to the worship of national gods, of which many were the equivalents of the gods in the Roman, Greek and Persian cultures.

Georg Brandes described the Armenian gods in his book: “When Armenia accepted Christianity, it was not only the temples which were destroyed, but also the songs and poems about the old gods and heroes that the people sang. We have only rare segments of these songs and poems, segments which bear witness of a great spiritual wealth and the power of creation of this people and these alone are sufficient reason enough for recreating the temples of the old Armenian gods. These gods were neither the Asian heavenly demons nor the precious and the delicate Greek gods, but something that reflected the characteristics of the Armenian people which they have been polishing through the ages, namely ambitious, wise and good-hearted.”

Steak

Steak (not to be confused with 'stake') is a slice off a larger piece of meat, usually beef. In North America, steaks are usually grilled. They are also often pan-fried or broiled. The most tender (softest) cuts of the animal are usually used for steak. This also means that steaks have a high price. The pieces of meat used for steaks are usually cut across the muscle fiber, not along it. This makes them appear more tender.

A restaurant that mainly makes steaks is known as a steakhouse. A well-known side dish to steak is prawns or a cooked lobster tail. This combination is often called "surf and turf" or "reef and beef" (the words "surf" and "reef" refer to the seafood and "turf" and "beef" refer to the steak). Special steak knives are used to cut steak. A steak knife is sharper than most table knives and is usually serrated.

Fish is not the only side dish for steak. Other common side dishes are baked potatoes, dinner rolls, salad, and corn on the cob. In France, steaks are often served with french fries. This combination is known as "steak fries" or "steak-frites". They do not come with vegetables, but sometimes a salad is served with them.

Often, steaks are served with a special sauce called "steak sauce", but sometimes steaks are served with a spicy sauce called horseradish

A common cut of steak is between 4 and 12 ozs, but some places serve steaks that are much, much bigger.

Steak comes in a wide variety of cuts, which come from different parts of the cow.
Some different cuts are:

Meat that is cooked less will appear to be more tender and soft. The usual degrees of cooking for steaks (and some other meats) are:

A jet engine is any engine that creates force by releasing a high speed jet of a liquid or a gas.

An example of a jet engine is a full balloon that is not held closed. It will release the air and push the balloon forward.

Turbojet engines are used on airplanes. Turbojet engines have a fan at the front that takes in air, the engine burns some paraffin to make the air expand, and it blows a big wind out the back. On the way out, the hot air turns another fan (a gas turbine) which turns the rod that turns the fan at the front to make it go.

Another example of a jet engine is a rocket engine.

Dawn Fraser

Dawn Fraser, AO, MBE (born September 4, 1937) is an Australian champion swimmer. She is one of only two swimmers to win the same Olympic event three different times. 

On 21 February 1956, at the age of 18, Fraser broke Willy den Ouden's world record for the 100m freestyle Ouden had held the record for twenty years. On 1 December of the same year, Fraser and the other swimmers for the Australian team won all three medals in the 100m freestyle at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. Fraser beat her own world record winning that race. She got a second gold medal and world record as part of the Australian team in the 4x100m freestyle relay and got a silver medal in the 400m freestyle.

Four years later, at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, Fraser won the 100m again. This made her the first woman to defend an Olympic swimming title. She also placed fifth in the 400m and won silver medals in the medley relay and freesyle relay. This was the first time the medley relay was an Olympic event. On 27 October 1962, in Melbourne, Fraser became the first woman to swim the 100m in less than one minute. She swam the longer distance of 110 yards in 59.9 seconds. 

At the 1964 Games in Tokyo, Fraser won the 100m again in a close race with Sharon Stouder of the United States. She became the first Olympic swimmer of either sex to win the same event three times. She also won a silver medal in the freestyle relay and placed fourth in the 400m. While in Tokyo, Fraser was arrested for taking a flag from the entrance to the Emperor's Palace. She said she was sorry she took it and the charges were dropped. The Emperor gave her the flag as a gift. However, she was banned from swimming for 10 years by the Australian Swimming Union, but then they felt bad and banned her for only four years. Fraser was not ready for the Olympics because she thought that she was banned and she did not swim at the Olympics ever again.
In 1988, Fraser was elected to the parliament of New South Wales. She served until 1991.

Bartonella rochalimae

Bartonella rochalimae is a recently discovered strain of Gram-negative bacteria. It is a member of the "Bartonella" genus. The bacteria was found by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco. Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also helped with the discovery.

The bacterium was first found in a 43-year-old American woman. She was in Peru when she became very sick. She had a high fever, anemia and insomnia. The illness was thought to be "Bartonella bacilliformis", a similar bacteria that causes Oroya fever. The scientists later discovered that a new species of bacteria had caused the illness. They gave the patient some antibiotics. Her condition later improved. 

The findings were published in the "New England Journal of Medicine" on June 7, 2007.

Tipi

A tipi (also called tepee or teepee) is a kind of tent. It is cone-shaped. They were made by Native Americans of the Great Plains who frequently moved from place to place.

Tepees are made from long poles, and are covered with material. Long ago the material was animal skin or tree bark. Today, they are made from cloth.

Tepees were put up in as a circle, which symbolized the life.

Tepees are no longer usually used for a full-time home, but they are still used for special occasions, such as pow-wows.

Tepees were used by the Lakota.

The Indians would sometimes paint and mark their tepees, and put signs to mark off evil.
They usually made the cover from buffalo skin.

Karen Carpenter

Karen Carpenter (March 2, 1950 – February 4, 1983) was an American singer and drummer who was most popular in the 70s. She is known as the singer of the group the Carpenters.

Karen Carpenter was born in New Haven, Connecticut on March 2, 1950. She played baseball a lot, and said that she likes being the pitcher. She has a brother, named Richard Carpenter. While Karen played baseball with her friends, Richard usually played the piano. Her parents, Agnes and Harold Carpenter, decided that they wanted to move to Downey, California, a city near Hollywood. They moved in 1963.

In Downey, Karen attended Downey High School. She was a good student, but did not like gym. In order to get out of gym, she asked to be in the marching band instead. When she got into the marching band, the director gave her the glockenspiel, an instrument that sounds somewhat like a xylophone. Karen did not like the glockenspiel and asked her band director if she could play the drums instead. Seeing Karen's natural talent for rhythm, the director approved. From then on, she practiced drumming on pots and pans before her parents finally bought her a drum set.

Her brother formed the Richard Carpenter Trio in 1965. Karen played the drums. Richard played the piano, and a friend named Wes Jacobs played the electric bass. They played jazz music at clubs in Hollywood. They entered the Battle of the Bands contest at the Hollywood Bowl in 1966. The Richard Carpenter Trio played "The Girl From Ipanema" and "Iced Tea," a song composed by Richard Carpenter. They won the Battle of the Bands that year. Afterwards, they signed with RCA Records, but the RCA thought their music would not sell, so RCA let them go. The Richard Carpenter Trio made one last TV appearance on "Your All American College Show" in 1968, where they played "Dancing in the Street." Karen had a great drum solo. They won the "Your All American College Show" contest, too.

In 1967, Richard and Karen formed another group called Spectrum. Spectrum focused on making big harmonies, and the public did not like their music. Both the Richard Carpenter Trio and Spectrum disbanded in 1968.

After five years of going nowhere, Richard and Karen Carpenter wanted to sign with a record label, but were constantly rejected. Joe Osborn, a bass player, had recording studio and let Richard and Karen record demo tapes. They sent in those demo tapes to a man named Herb Alpert. Herb Alpert appreciated Richard and Karen's music, and agreed to sign the two to his record label, A&M Records.

In April of 1969, Richard and Karen Carpenter signed to A&M Records as "Carpenters." They released their first album that year as well. It was called "Offering." It did not have any popular songs on there, except for a song called "Ticket to Ride." When they released it as a single, the public's reaction was somewhat less than great. Too many people were accustomed to the Beatles' version.

The next year, Herb Alpert recommended a song called "(They Long to Be) Close to You." After being given the music, Richard Carpenter worked on on arranging it to invent their own sound. This song was their first major hit. It went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Later that year, the Carpenters recorded another song, called "We've Only Just Begun." It was originally for a commercial for a bank called "Crocker Bank", but Richard saw potential in it. He again began working on the arrangement and the song was released. Ultimately, "We've Only Just Begun" released it as a single, went to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Throughout their career, Karen and Richard continued to be successful and release great singles. All of them placed in the top 20 until 1977. In 1977, both singles released only peaked at #32 and #35. Their last top 20 single was released in 1981, and it was called "Touch Me When We're Dancing."

Anorexia Nervosa is an eating disorder. It is a physiological disorder that is characterized by undereating, due to an inaccurate body image. Victims of this disorder are typically perfectionists that have trouble showing their emotions. Karen Carpenter's eating disorder started in 1967, when the group "Spectrum" was still playing. Because she was moderately overweight, her doctor advised her to lose weight. Her doctor then suggested a diet called the "Stillman Diet." She drank 8 cups of water everyday and avoided high calorie foods. Karen lost about 25 pounds from the Stillman Diet. After she became successful, she decided that she needed to lose more weight. In 1975, she lost so much weight that she became ill. Eventually, she collapsed on stage and was sent to the hospital. At one time, she was only 80 pounds and 5'4" tall (five feet, four inches). A woman her height should be between 124 to 138 pounds. Becoming aware of her illness, she decided to gain weight. In 1982, she was the healthiest she'd been, but her heart failed. It's been proven that she had been abusing laxatives and thyroid pills. She may have also abused syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting, but that has not been proven. On February 4, 1983, Karen Carpenter died at the age of 32 from heart failure.

With the Carpenters, Karen Carpenter had a lot of records. Here is a list of them. The "italicized" words are the names of the records, and the things in the (parentheses) are the years that the records were released.

Luke the Evangelist

Luke the Evangelist is said to be the man who wrote the Gospel of Luke and Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. Irenaeus, Eusebius of Caesarea and Jerome say that he was a friend of Saint Paul and a doctor, and that he accompanied Paul on some of his travels. These people also say that he was of Greek origin, from Antioch in Syria.

Modern-day scholars think that the person that wrote the two books was not the same that accompanied Paul. Paul had a theology that was special, and slightly different from that of other writers of the New Testament. The two books written by Luke never refer to this theology. Also, the name of Paul's companion is never linked to writing the two books. The Acts of the Apostles often tell things about Paul which Paul odes not tell himself in his letters. 

Luke wrote about the Three Wise Men who visited Jesus in the Bible. Luke never said there were 3 wise men, only wise men from the east.

Toyama Prefecture (富山県, Toyama-ken) is in the Chūbu, meaning centre part, region on Honshū island, Japan. 
The capital is Toyama.

Toyama is famous by its great mountains and rich fishery. Trout sushi(ますずし;masu-zushi), firefly squid(ほたるいか;hotaru-ika) and mass product of tulip industry are also famous.

Toyama is one of the strongest industrial prefecture on the Japan-sea coast, in which companies were historically taking advantage of cheap electricity generated from its rich water with 3000-meter class mountains. The Itai-itai disease, whose origin is from polluted water with cadmium, occurred in Toyama around 1950.

Nowadays, electricity is not surprisingly cheap, because they mainly use oil to generate it. But Aluminum industry is still strong with companies such as YKK or Sankyo Aluminum.

By 2006, there were two company-owned football teams.
Toyama has rapidly become a sporting prefecture when they began to have a nation-wide professional basketball team and a regional baseball team is started by great support of many companies.
But there is no teams in NPB, major baseball league, and J. League, Japan's highest-level football league.

51st state

51st state, is sometimes a joke term in American politics, and sometimes a realistic one, that talks about a land that is not a part of USA, but people think about adding to the United States and making it the 51st state. Sometimes "51st state" is said not as a joke (about Puerto Rico or other territories). Usually it is a joke about Canada (even though Canada is an independent country) because Canada is right next to America and both countries are English-speaking. There have been tries by people in the United States to get Canada to join them (like in the Articles of Confederation), Canada has never taken up these offers. Before the year 1959 when Alaska and Hawaii became states, the word "the 49th state" was used. "51st State" sometimes is about countries that seem to be controlled by the United States.

The term is used in Canada and other countries to show that they think there is a bad U.S. influence on the world. In Europe and Australia, people who think their culture has become too much like America's culture sometimes use the term "51st state" about their own countries. In Europe, it can also mean Iceland because the USA is a very important country in Icelandic politics and economy, Finland because American culture is very popular in Finland, or Great Britain, because people speak English language both in the USA and Great Britain.

The term 51st state can also mean non-Americans who like American culture and act like Americans, or a non-American politician who is a supporter of the United States, especially its foreign politics.

Places in the United States that are not states right now that might become the 51st state are Puerto Rico, Washington, D.C., Guam, the US Virgin Islands, or the Northern Marianas. The most serious proposals for forming 51 or even 52 states are those for dividing the most-populous state (and third-largest state, geographically)of California into two or even three states, giving that area either four or six seats in the U.S. Senate, rather than just two as is the present situation, plus more-efficient local administrations.

Some regions of the U.S.A. that include land that is now in two different states and might become a new state include the "State of Jefferson" (Northmost California plus the southern counties of Oregon) and the "State of Lincoln" (Eastmost Washington State plus the northern panhandle of Idaho. A move has also been proposed to separate the westmost one-fourth of Nebraska from that state, but to add that to Wyoming (the least-populous state), rather than to create an entirely-new state. This region is actually much closer to Cheyenne, Wyoming, the capital city, than it is to its current capital of Lincoln, Nebraska.

Mogadishu

Mogadishu (Somali: "Muqdisho") is the capital city of the African country of Somalia. It is also the largest city in that country. Mogadishu is in Benadir region on the Indian Ocean. The city has been an important port for the region for centuries. Estimates of thepopulation of the city are between 1.5 and 3 million people. 

Mogadishu has had 16 years of fighting between militias. This is because the government of Somalia fell in 1991. 

Trade between the people in the Mogadishu area with other areas along the Indian coast of Africa started as early as the 1st century. Muslim traders from the Arabian Peninsula came to the area during the 10th century. Because of trade with them, Islam spread through Somalia. The Portuguese tried to take control of the city, but failed. In 1871 Barghash bin Said, the sultan of Zanzibar, controlled the city. 

In 1892, Ali bin Said let Italy use the city. Italy bought the city in 1905. They made "Mogadiscio" (Italian for Mogadishu) the capital of Italian Somaliland. The Italians took control of the area around the city in 1936 after heavy resistance. British forces that were in Kenya during World War II captured Mogadishu on February 26, 1941. The British ruled until they gave Italy control of the city again in 1952. Somalia became independent in 1960 with Mogadishu as its capital.

Rebel forces entered and took the city in 1990. They forced President Mohamed Siad Barre to resign and leave the country in January 1991. He went to Lagos, Nigeria. Some of the rebels said that Ali Mahdi Muhammad was the new president. Others said that Mohamed Farrah Aidid was president. A group of United States Marines landed near Mogadishu on December 9, 1992. They were the first part of the United Nations peacekeeping forces during Operation Restore Hope to go to the country. 

Mogadishu is a commercial and financial center for Somalia. The economy got better after the Somali Civil War but there are still problems. Because there is no government, there is free trade without taxes or regulatory costs. This makes businesses not cost as much as it does in other places. Businesses have hired armed militias to have security. This is causing less violence in the city.

The main industries of the city include making food and beverages as well as textiles. The main textile is cotton. The main market many different types of goods from food to electronic items.

Mogadishu has the most port traffic of any port in Somalia. It is still a major seaport. However, there is much piracy around Somalia's coastal areas. This makes trade risky.

It is used to pay, or part-pay, for the local public broadcaster, such as the BBC in the United Kingdom. It mainly exists in Europe, East Asia and parts of Africa. The licence fee varies in size from a few euros to around 350 euros per year in Iceland. In return for paying the licence, the broadcaster does have few or no adverts. 

In the past, before television was well known, people used to have a radio licence, which is a roughly the same as television licence, but for radio. Some countries still have the radio licence together with the television licence.

Nicosia

Nicosia, also known as Lefkosia (Greek: Λευκωσία Turkish: Lefkoşa) is the capital city of the island country of Cyprus. It is also the largest city of that country. Niscosia is on the Pedieos (Kanlidere) river in the centre of the island. The city is the seat of government as well as the main business centre for Cyprus. Nicosia is capital of the administrative district (Nicosia District) 

Nicosia is the only divided capital city in the world. It has a northern (Turkish) section and a southern (Greek) section. These sections are divided by the "Green Line". It is a demilitarized zone created by the United Nations. Unlike Cold War East and West Berlin, the terms "North Nicosia" and "South Nicosia" are not commonly used. The northern half of Nicosia is the capital of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).

The Greek part of the city has a population of 270,000 people (2004). Also, 84,893 people live in the Turkish zone. Nicosia has many shops, restaurants and entertainment. The city is a trade center. It manufactures textiles, leather, pottery, plastic, and other items. Copper mines are nearby. The University of Cyprus (UCY) is in Nicosia.

Nicosia was a city-state known as Ledra or Ledrae in ancient times. The king of Ledra was Onasagoras in 672 BC. The city was rebuilt by Lefkos, son of Ptolemy I around 300 BC. Ledra in Hellenic and Roman times was a small, unimportant town, also known as Lefkothea. It got its first Christian bishop, Trifillios, in 348.

The city became the island's capital around the 10th century. It had grown in importance because of threats to the coastal cities Paphos and Salamis. These threats made many people leave the coast of the island and move to Lefkosia in the center of the island.

The city became a Venetian possession in 1489. It was captured by the Ottoman Empire in 1571. During this time, the city grew culturally. In the 15th and 16th centuries, many palaces, churches and monasteries were built. About 20,000 people living in the city died because of the Ottoman attack of 1570.
Many disasters happened in the city during the 19th century. Cholera hit the city in 1835. Fire destroyed large parts of Nicosia in 1857. 

The British Empire took control of the island in 1878. Nicosia was the capital of the new British colony.

In early 1974, military forces supported by the Greek government took control of Cyprus. Because of this, Turkey sent forces to the island to also try and take control of it. The Turkish forces caused the Greek supported government to end but the Turks refused to leave the country. The believed that if they left, the Turkish people living in Cyprus would be in . The Turkish forces moved to the northern part of Cyprus and stayed there. Because of this, Cyprus and the city of Nicosia were divided in half. The northern area is contolled by Turkish Cypriots (people from Cyprus) as a part of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The southern part is controlled by Greek Cypriots. 

Only the country of Turkey says that the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is an actual country.

Auckland Grammar School

Auckland Grammar School is a public school in Auckland New Zealand. It teaches boys from age thirteen to eighteen. The school also has some places near the school where students who come from distant places can live. It is one of the biggest schools in New Zealand. The school has more than two thousand students. The School's motto is ""Per Angusta Ad Augusta"". It means "Through difficulties to greatness".

Auckland Grammar School was first set up in 1868 by Sir George Grey. He was the governor of New Zealand from 1861-1868. During that time, the new European settlers were fighting with the Maori people over land rights issues. The Governor of New Zealand asked for military help from the British Empire. Britain sent up to one million soldiers to New Zealand to end the problems. Many of the soldiers settled with their families in Auckland. Sir George Grey decided to create Auckland Grammar School to give a very good education to the soldiers' sons.

Tibbs House was opened in 1962 with 46 boys to provide an opportunity for boys outside of the greater Auckland area to attend Auckland Grammar School.

It was named after the fourth Headmaster of Auckland Grammar School, Mr J W Tibbs MA, CMG, who was Headmaster from 1893 to 1922. A statue of Mr Tibbs can be found at the entrance to Old Tibbs House.

People of all classes or racial background who live in New Zealand are all the same when it comes to being allowed to go to the school. The school believes it is very important to teach many different languages and, in particular, 'the instructing in Latin.' The school tries to get all of the students to do very well in all educational areas, for example, Academic, Sporting and Cultural fields. The school does however show some disregard for national educational standards. Auckland Grammar is considered one of the more "uptight" schools in the Auckland region offering conforming students the best education.

Virginia Beach, Virginia

Virginia Beach is an American city in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The city is located in the South Hampton Roads area on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the largest city in Virginia and the 42nd largest city in the United States. The city has a total population of 447,000 people.

Virginia Beach is a part of the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News metropolitan area. The area also includes the cities of Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth, and Suffolk, as well as other smaller cities, counties and towns of Hampton Roads. The area is known as "America's First Region."
Virginia Beach is best known as a resort town. It has miles of beaches and hundreds of hotels, motels, and restaurants along the Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay. It is also home to several state parks, three military bases, a number of large corporations, and two universities. It was the site of the first landing of English colonists going to Jamestown. 

The city is listed in the "Guinness Book of Records" as having the longest pleasure beach in the world and. It is also located at the southern end of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, the longest bridge-tunnel in the world.

Chesepians were the Native American (American Indian) people living in the area now known as South Hampton Roads in Virginia during the time the English settlers came in 1607. They lived in an area which is now the cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Chesapeake and Virginia Beach. 

The Chesepians had two other towns (or villages), Apasus and Chesepioc. Both were near the Chesapeake Bay in what is now Virginia Beach. Archaeologists and other people have found many Native American artifacts, for example arrowheads, stone axes, pottery, beads, and skeletons in the area. 

In 1607, after traveling by ocean for 144 days, three ships headed by Captain Christopher Newport came to land where the Atlantic Ocean meets the southern mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. This point is in the northeastern part of the city. They named it Cape Henry, after Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, the oldest son of King James I of England. They then left the area to find a place farther inland where ships from other European countries would not find them. They created their first settlement at Jamestown. 
Adam Thoroughgood (1604-1640) of Norfolk, England is one of the first Englishmen to settle in the area which became Virginia Beach. 

In 1634, the Colony was divided into shires. They were soon renamed counties. It is said that Thoroughgood used the name of his home in England when helping name New Norfolk County in 1637. The following year, New Norfolk County was split into Upper Norfolk County (soon renamed Nansemond County) and Lower Norfolk County. Thoroughgood chose to live along the Lynnhaven River, also named for his home in England. Lower Norfolk County was very big. It stretched all the way from the Atlantic Ocean west past the Elizabeth River. It included the entire area that is now the cities of Portsmouth, Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach.

In 1691, Lower Norfolk County was divided to form Norfolk County to the west and Princess Anne County to the east. Princess Anne included all the area from North Carolina border to Cape Henry at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay along the Atlantic Ocean. Princess Anne County existed from 1691 to 1963, over 250 years. 

The small resort area of Virginia Beach began to grow in Princess Anne County in the late 19th century. This growth was helped in 1888 when rail service and electricity started in the area. 

The resort was dependent upon railroad and electric trolley service at first. The concrete Virginia Beach Boulevard from Norfolk to the Oceanfront was completed in 1922. It let people get to the oceanfront in automobiles, buses, and trucks. The resort of Virginia Beach became an incorporated town in 1906. Over the next 45 years, Virginia Beach became more popular as a summer vacation spot. Virginia Beach became a small independent city in 1952. It was politically independent from Princess Anne County. In 1963, Virginia Beach and Princess Anne county merged into a new, much larger independent city keeping the name of the Virginia Beach resort.

Virginia Beach has an area of 1,288.1 km² (497.3 mi²). Of that area, 643.1 km² (248.3 mi²) is land and 645.0 km² (249.0 mi²) is water. The average elevation is 12 feet (4 meters) above sea level. 


The Edgar Cayce Hospital for Research and Enlightenment was started in Virginia Beach in 1928 with 60 beds. Cayce was a psychic from Kentucky who said he had healing abilities and made prophesies. Cayce lived in Virginia Beach until he died in 1945. His followers are still active in Virginia Beach. Atlantic University was opened by Cayce in 1930; it closed two years later but was re-opened in 1985. Atlantic University was originally intended for study of Cayce's readings and research after spiritual subjects.

There are also eleven golf courses open to the public in the city, as well as four country club courses and NAS Oceana's Aeropines course. Among the best-known public courses are Hell's Point Golf Club and the TPC of Virginia Beach.
Virginia Beach is home to several United States Military bases. These include the United States Navy's NAS Oceana and FTC Dam Neck, and the United States Army's Fort Story located at Cape Henry. NAB Little Creek is located mostly within the city of Virginia Beach but has a Norfolk address. 

NAS Oceana is the largest employer in Virginia Beach. It is said to the largest naval airbase in the world.
Virginia Beach has three Sister Cities:

The Maghen Abraham Synagogue is the oldest synagogue in Beirut, capital of Lebanon. A synagogue is where Jews go to pray. But, this synagogue is old, and no one used it for long. But, people in Beirut can still see it in Wadi Abu Jamil, the place where Lebanese Jews used to live. Today, some Lebanese Jews are trying to repair the synagogue, so that they can use it again.
This synagogue was very important to Jewish Lebanese in the early twentieth century. It was built in 1925. It was then named after the son of Abraham Sason. Also, it was used as a place to stay for illegal travelers. Some of the people who traveled without legal papers stayed in the synagogue while going to Palestine. Today, it is now called Israel.
In 1976, a year after the civil war began, Joseph Farhi took the Torah scrolls from the synagogue to Geneva. Most of them were sent to Sephardic synagogues in Israel.

Israel attacked its enemies in Lebanon. This brought anger by other people towards Lebanese Jews. Lebanese Jews became targets to Islamic militant groups since 1984. But even during the fighting, Yasser Arafat's PLO forces and the Christian Phalangists did protect Wadi Abu Jamil during the 1982 Lebanon War. But, the presence of Palestine Liberation Organization forces in the area brought Israeli attacks that damaged the synagogue itself.

The late former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri wanted to rebuild the synagoge, but that never happened. The Talmudic school next to it was broken down. This was to keep view of the beach nearby.

Bentheuphausia amblyops

Bentheuphausia amblyops is a species of krill. Krill are small shrimp-like crustaceans living in the ocean.

"B. amblyops" is the only species within its genus, which in turn is the only genus within the family Bentheuphausiidae. All the 85 other species of krill known are classified in the family Euphausiidae.

"B. amblyops" can be found in the northern Atlantic Ocean. It occurs in latitudes south of 40° N, and also in the southern seas of the Atlantic, in the Indian Ocean and in the Pacific. It is a bathypelagic krill that lives in deep waters below 1,000 m. It is distinguished from the Euphausiidae by several morphological features. The features most easily used to tell it apart are that the animals are "not" bioluminescent and that their first pair of pleopods is "not" modified as copulatory tool organs. Also, their eyes are smaller than those of the Euphausiidae. Adults reach a length of 4 to 5 cm.

Malacostraca

The Malacostraca (Greek: "soft shell") are the largest subgroup of crustaceans. They include decapods (such as crabs, lobsters and shrimp), stomatopods (mantis shrimp) and krill. There are 22,000 members in this group. It represents two thirds of all crustacean species. The first malacostracans appeared in the Cambrian period.

The classification of crustaceans is currently being debated. Some think Malacostraca is a class and others think it is a subclass.

Malacostraca have heads with six segments. They have a pair of antennules and a pair of antennae. They also have mouthparts. There are appendages near the mouthparts, called maxillipeds. They have five pairs of walking legs. The first pair is formed like a pincer. There are eight thoracic segments. There are six abdominal segments. They are used for swimming. Members of Malacostraca have compound stalked or sessile eyes. They have a two-chambered stomach and a centralized nervous system.

<doc id="62511" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62511" title="Decapod">
Decapod

The decapods or Decapoda are an order of crustaceans within the class Malacostraca. Many familiar groups, such as crayfish, crabs, lobsters, prawns and shrimp can be found in this order. Most decapods are scavengers - they eat dead plants and animals.

As their name suggests, all decapods have ten legs. These are the last five of the eight pairs of thoracic legs characteristic of crustaceans. The front three pairs are used as jaws and are called maxillipeds. The others are pereiopods (walking legs). In many decapods, however, one pair of legs has large pinching claws; the claws are called "chelae", so those legs may be called "chelipeds". More legs are found on the abdomen. Each segment can carry a pair of two-branched pleopods (swimming legs). The last of them form part of the tail fan and are called uropods.

Classification within the order Decapoda depends on the structure of the gills and legs, and the way in which the larvae develop. This allows to split them into two suborders: Dendrobranchiata and Pleocyemata. Prawns (including many species informally referred to as "shrimp", such as the Atlantic white shrimp) make up the Dendrobranchiata. The other groups, including true shrimp, are the Pleocyemata.

The following classification follows Martin and Davis, with some changes based on more recent structural and molecular studies.

Hariri was killed on February 14, 2005. 1000 kg of TNT exploded near his car. His car was passing through St. George Hotel in the Lebanese capital, Beirut. People are still trying to learn who did it, and it is done with help from the United Nations. Serge Brammertz is leading this investigation. Many people in Lebanon said that the government of Syria and its friends did it. So far, Brammertz said that DNA evidence collected from the exploded area shows that the killing was done by a young man. It is believed that this man blew himself up at the time.

Antennae (singular antenna) are paired feelers (appendages) connected to the front segments of crustaceans and insects. They are found on the first two segments of the head. The smaller pair is known as antennules. 

Antennae are jointed and extend forward from the head. They are sensory organs. The organ may sense touch, air motion, heat, vibration (sound), and especially olfaction (smell) or gustation (taste).

The Satanic Verses

The Satanic Verses is a novel by Salman Rushdie. 

Part of it was inspired by the life of Muhammad. The title refers to Satanic verses. This is one of the interpretations of the Koran. This interpretation is what Ibn Ishaq did in the oldest surviving text of the work. Some Islamic and most non-Muslim Western historians and commentators on the Qur'an have accepted this story of Muhammad's momentary acceptance of the verses. A common Muslim viewpoint is that the existence of the verses is just a fabrication created by non-Muslims.

The novel caused much controversy when it was published. Many Muslims felt that it contained blasphemous references. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran, a Shi'a Muslim scholar, issued a fatwa that called for the death of Rushdie and claimed that it was the duty of every Muslim to obey. As a result, Hitoshi Igarashi, the Japanese language translator of the book was stabbed to death on July 11, 1991; Ettore Capriolo, the Italian language translator, was seriously injured in a stabbing the same month. William Nygaard, the publisher in Norway, survived an attempted assassination in Oslo in October of 1993. On February 14, 2006, the Iranian state news agency reported that the fatwa will remain in place permanently.

In the United Kingdom, however, the book was praised by a lot of critics. It was a 1988 Booker Prize Finalist, eventually losing to Peter Carey's "Oscar and Lucinda".

Kanji

Kanji is one of the three forms of Japanese writing. A kanji is an "ideogram": that is, a kind of simple picture. It is a symbol of an idea such as an object, thing or quality.

Kanji ideograms (or “characters”) were taken about 2000 years ago from Chinese characters, and many were gradually changed. The word “kanji” means “Han characters” (i.e. “Chinese characters”). 
There are two other systems used to write in Japanese. These systems are called Hiragana and Katakana (together they are called “Kana”). They show how a word is pronounced because each character stands for a syllable (a, ka, sa, ta etc.). Each kanji could also be written in kana, indeed they are in children’s books or books for foreigners learning Japanese. 

Many words in Japanese can have more than one meaning, e.g. “hana” can mean “nose” or “flower”, but the kanji character for each is quite different. However, each kanji character can have several different pronunciations, according to which meaning (which “reading”) is intended.

Kanji was originally written to look like what it means, thus the Japanese symbol for mouth is 口 (which is said as "koo-chi"), and looks like a mouth. Another word, 山 (said as "ya-ma") means mountain. The Japanese have Kanji for many words. Many can be shown with just one Kanji, but sometimes two Kanji characters are combined to make new words, such as 山口 ("yamaguchi"), "mountain-mouth", meaning a cave. (That is also the surname of Olympic figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi, and the name of a prefecture).

Kanji is often combined with hiragana to show the grammatical meaning of the word. In English this would be done with endings (e.g. “act” (the verb), “action” (the noun) etc.

Many kanji characters can be pronounced in two different ways according to whether the word stands alone (this is called the “kun” reading, or “kun-yomi”), or whether it is combined with another word (this called the “on” reading or “on-yomi”). The kun reading is based on Japanese pronunciation, the on reading is based on Chinese pronunciation. For example, 山on its own is "yama" (the Japanese word for “mountain”). When it is combined with another word or name, it is pronounced "san" e.g. “Fuji-san” (“Mount Fuji”).

Kanji characters are classed on the basis of how many brush strokes they are made of. The simplest kanji have one stroke and the most complex may have up to 23 strokes.

There are many different Kanji, the exact number is not known but it is around 50,000. However, not all 50,000 are taught in schools. The government of Japan has set up a 1945 basic Kanji list (Jōyō Kanji) that those learning the language ought to know. They are the ones most commonly used in newspapers and magazines, along with street signs and store signs. Kanji takes many years to learn. By the end of his school years a pupil should know about 1.850 Kanji. A university graduate would need to know about 3000. If someone does not know the Kanji for a word, they can write it in Kana and it will be understood, but it is not the proper way to write it.

<doc id="62585" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62585" title="Libretto">
Libretto

A libretto is the text (the words) which are set to music to make an opera. A libretto can also be the words for an oratorio, cantata, mass or a musical. The person who writes the libretto is called a librettist. The word “libretto” (plural: “libretti” or “librettos”) is an Italian word which means “little book”.

Sometimes a composer writes his own libretti, but usually a composer likes to have a librettist who can write the words for him so that he can set them to music.

Some libretti are original stories by the librettist, but very often they are based on a book by another writer.

In the 18th century Metastasio was a very famous librettist. Many of his libretti were set several times by different composers. Another 18th century librettist was Lorenzo da Ponte, who wrote the libretti for three of Mozart's greatest operas, as well as for many other composers. In the 19th century Eugène Scribe wrote a very large number of libretti that were set to music by composers such as Meyerbeer, Auber, Bellini, Donizetti, Rossini and Verdi. Two French writers called Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy wrote a large number of opera and operetta libretti for the composers Jacques Offenbach, Jules Massenet and Georges Bizet. Arrigo Boito, who wrote libretti for, among others, Giuseppe Verdi and Amilcare Ponchielli, composed two operas of his own. Hugo von Hoffmansthal wrote libretti for Richard Strauss.

Wagner and Tippett are two composers who wrote their own libretti.

Usually a libretto is written before the music, but sometimes composers wrote some of the music first and then looked for words to go with it. Composers, such as Mikhail Glinka, Alexander Serov, Rimsky-Korsakov, Puccini, and Mascagni all did this sometimes.

Musicals usually have lyrics (the words for the songs), and a separate "book" ( the spoken dialogue and the stage directions). Sometimes these two are by different authors, e.g. the musical Fiddler on the Roof has a composer (Jerry Bock), a lyricist (Sheldon Harnick), and the writer of the "book" (Joseph Stein).

Hmong people

The words Hmong and Mong refer to an Asian ethnic group. Their homeland is southern China. In the 18th century, Hmong people started moving to other Southeast Asian countries. Today, they live in northern Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar. In 1975, communists took over Laos. After they took over, many Hmong people moved to the United States, Australia, France, French Guiana, and Canada. Hmong people divide themselves into the White Hmong, the Green Hmong, and other smaller groups.

Hmong people have been living in southern China for at least 2,000 years. 

From 1919 to 1921, the Hmong people were involved a war. The French called this war the War of the Insane. 

From 1962 to 1975, the Hmong people were involved in the Laotian Civil War, also known as the Secret War.

China has the largest population of Hmong people with 3 million Hmong people. Vietnam has 787,600 Hmong people, Laos has 320,000 Hmong people, and Thailand has 150,000 Hmong people. Some Hmong people live in Myanmar.

Outside of Asia, the United States has the most Hmong people; it has 186,310 Hmong people. France has 15,000 Hmong people, Australia has 2,000 Hmong people, and French Guiana has 1,500 Hmong people. Canada and Argentina have a total of 600 Hmong people.

Toplessness (or being topless) is a state of not wearing any clothing above the waist, meaning the breasts are visible.

Because the female breast is often associated with sexuality, many countries consider it alright for men to be topless in public, but not women. However some countries consider it usual for women to be topless, usually due to the natural heat.

Westminster Cathedral

Westminster Cathedral in London, England, is a Roman Catholic cathedral. It is the mother church of the Roman Catholic community in England and Wales and the Metropolitan Church and Cathedral for the Archbishop of Westminster. 

The cathedral is near Victoria in the City of Westminster. It is the largest Roman Catholic church in England and Wales. It should not be confused with Westminster Abbey.

The cathedral was opened in 1903. It was designed by John Francis Bentley and is in the style of Byzantine church architecture. The nave is the widest of any church in England. The sanctuary is higher than the nave, so that the altar can be seen from any part of the nave. A very large crucifix hangs from the chancel arch. The Archiepiscopal Throne or cathedra, of marble and mosaic, is modelled on the Papal Throne at the Basilica of St. John Lateran in Rome. There are beautiful marble pillars which are all carved differently. In the crypt there are monuments to famous people.

Westminster Cathedral has a famous choir. The first Master of Music (choirmaster) was Sir Richard Runciman Terry. Since 2000, the Master of Music has been Martin Baker. Mass is sung every day.

The choir are famous for singing Gregorian chant and polyphony of the Renaissance. Composers such as Benjamin Britten and Ralph Vaughan Williams have written music for the choir.

All the boys of the Choir are boarders at the nearby Westminster Cathedral Choir School.

The organ is very large. It is in the west gallery (above the entrance). It was built by the organ builder Henry Willis III from 1922 to 1932. One of Louis Vierne's best-known organ pieces, "Carillon de Westminster," was composed for it and dedicated to the builder.

On May 28, 1982, the first day of his six-day visit to the United Kingdom, Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass in the Cathedral.

In 1995, Cardinal Basil Hume invited HM The Queen. This was the first visit of a reigning monarch of the United Kingdom to a Catholic liturgy since 1688 when James II & VII was king.

<doc id="62612" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62612" title="Median">
Median

In probability theory and statistics, the median is a number. This number has the property that it divides a set of observed values in two equal halves, so that half of the values are below it, and half are above.

If there are a finite number of elements, the median is easy to find. The values need to be arranged in a list, lowest to highest. If there is an odd number of values, the median is the one at position formula_1. For example, if there are 13 values, they can be arranged into two groups of 6, with the median in between, at position 7. With an even number of values, as there is no single number which divides all of the numbers to two halves, the median is defined as the mean of the two central elements. With 14 observations, this would be the mean of elements 7 and 8, which is their sum divided by 2.

Alternatively, the median of an even-sized list is sometimes defined as either of the two middle elements; the choice being either (a) always the smallest one, (b) always the largest one, or (c) randomly choose between the two. This alternative definition has two important advantages: it guarantees that the median is always a list element (e.g., a list of integers will never have a fractional median), and it guarantees that the median exists for any ordinal-valued data. On the other hand, when one of the choices (a) or (b) is taken, the median of a sample will be biased, which is an unwanted property of a statistical estimator. Definition (c) does not have that disadvantage, but is more difficult to implement and additionally has the disadvantage that the same list of values does not have a well-defined, deterministic median.

Median and mean are different in several ways. Mean is a better measure in many cases, because many of the statistical tests can use mean and standard deviation of two observations to compare them, while the same comparison cannot be performed using the medians.

On the opposite, median is a better statistical measure in some cases where the variance of the values is not important and we only need a central measure of the values. If the maximum value of a set of numbers changes while the other numbers of this set are kept the same, the mean of this set of numbers changes, but the median does not.

One of the other advantages of median is that, it can be calculated sooner when we are studying survival data. For example, a researcher can calculate the median survival of patients with a kidney transplant, when half the patients participated in his study die; in contrast, if he wants to calculate the mean survival, he must continue the study and follow all of the patients until their death.

Suppose you want to know how many jelly beans most people in the room have. Let's say there are five people in the room:


The results change a lot when you have a bigger range of numbers. Let's imagine a different group of five people:
In this second case, the mean gives you a poor understanding how how many jelly beans most people have (10 or less). The median gives you a better idea of the number of jelly beans most people have. If you wanted to divide up the number of jelly beans equally, however, you would use the mean.

Mode (statistics)

In statistics, the mode is a number. Very often, samples of data are collected. These might be measurements of some kind. In this context, the mode is the value that occurs most often. Unlike the median and the mean, the mode is not necessarily unique. There might be several different values that occur the same number of times.

S.S.C. Napoli ("Società Sportiva Calcio Napoli") is an Italian football club. The club plays in Serie A. Its home stadium is the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy. They team plays in light blue shirts, white shorts and light blue socks as uniforms.

The club was formed in 1926 and it was in most of its history in Serie A. It was Diego Armando Maradona who put Napoli on the world soccer map, leading them to scudettos in 1987 and 1990 and the UEFA Cup in 1989. They also won the Coppa Italia in 1962, 1976, and 1987, a Coppa delle Alpi in 1966 and a Supercoppa Italiana in 1991.

Napoli dropped to Serie B in 2001. With a debt of about 70 million euros, the club went bankrupt in August of 2004. A new club, Napoli Soccer, was born. Napoli Soccer was renamed Società Sportiva Calcio Napoli in early 2006.

Bread is now much sweeter than it was in the Middle Ages because a lot of corn syrup or honey is used.

Statistical hypothesis test

A statistical hypothesis test is a method used in statistics to answer a question (the "hypothesis"), based on some "data" (information).

A statistical test works out a number which relates the information to the question. This is compared to other numbers. The critical value is the number which the test would give if the question was true. So if the statistical test gives a number close to the critical value, probably the answer to the question is true. But if the test gives a number very different from the critical value, probably the answer is false.

Ramanujan's result at the end of the paper was:

where formula_2"(x)" is the prime counting function. The prime counting function is the number of primes less than or equal to "x".

The numbers 2, 11, 17, 29, 41 are first few Ramanujan primes. In other words:

Bertrand's postulate states that if "n" > 3 is an integer, then there always exists at least one prime number "p" with "n" < "p" < 2"n" − 2. 

This statement was first made in 1845 by Joseph Bertrand. Bertrand verified his statement for all numbers in the interval [2, 3 × 10].

His statement was completely proven by Pafnuty Chebyshev in 1850. For this reason, the postulate is also called the Bertrand-Chebyshev theorem or Chebyshev's theorem. Srinivasa Ramanujan gave a simpler proof. Ramanujan later used that proof when he discovered Ramanujan primes. In 1932, Paul Erdős published a simpler proof using the Chebyshev function θ("x").

He worked with hundreds of mathematicians on problems in combinatorics, graph theory, number theory, classical analysis, approximation theory, set theory, and probability theory.

Because he wrote so many articles, friends created Erdős number. Erdős has a number of 0 (for being himself), and his direct collaborators were given the number 1. Their collaborators were given a number of 2, an so on.

Wikipedia:Sock puppetry

Sock puppeting is using more than one account in order to violate or cause disruption. The user who uses a may be called a sock puppeteer. Using sock puppets is usually not encouraged.

Using more than one account is not always bad. When people use sock puppets, it is recommended that they link to their original account. It will be easier to know the status of an account. Some people feel a Wikipedian should not have more than one account. Others feel if sock puppet accounts are used for good purposes, then it is fine. For example, one makes a sockpuppet to change articles on public computers. See for information on how sock puppetry affects other online communities.

Alternative accounts should not be used to change pages in ways that would be considered improper if done by a single account. Using alternative puppet accounts to split your contributions history means that other editors cannot detect patterns in your contributions.

A bad hand account is one that you would use to make bad changes, such as while keeping your good hand account clean of any changes that might reflect negatively on you. A good hand account is an account you use to make good changes to the project. It is never acceptable to keep one account "clean", while using another account to engage in disruptive behavior.

Alternative accounts have legitimate uses. For example, prominent users might make a new account to experience how the community functions for new users.

Some editors use alternative accounts to segregate their contributions for various reasons:


Doppelgänger is a German word for a ghostly double of a living person. In the context of a user account, a doppelgänger account is a second account made with a username similar to one's main account to preemptively prevent impersonation by vandals. Such accounts are permitted and should be marked with the or simply redirected to one's own userpage. Doppelgänger accounts should not be used for changing pages.

If you have a negative track record and you have decided to make a genuine, clean, and honest new start, and do not wish it to be tarnished by your prior conduct, you can simply stop using the old account(s), and make an unconnected new account. This becomes the only account you then use, and is used in a good manner. 

Discontinuing the old account means specifically that the old account is not used for changing ever again. If the old account is later used in addition to a new account after supposedly being discontinued, then it has not been discontinued and would fall under the policy for alternative accounts, above.

When an account is discontinued, it is recommended that the old account be noted on its user page as being inactive, in order to prevent the switch being interpreted as an attempt to abusively sock puppet. The tag can be used.

Note that the "" does "not" cover this, and repeated switching of accounts is usually seen as a way of avoiding scrutiny and considered as a breach of this policy. This option is also "not" available to users, who are prohibited from editing Wikipedia altogether, either anonymously or under any user name.

Editors who operate have to make separate accounts (and request they be marked as bot accounts via ), so the automated changes can be filtered out of .

s, accounts which are used by multiple people, are only officially sanctioned on Wikipedia in exceptional cases. If you run one account with multiple users, it is likely to be blocked.

However, and reserve the right to use role accounts where necessary.

Freeganism

The word "freeganism" (person: freegan; related: freecycling) means to get things for free rather than buy those items. A "freegan" is a person who does not like to pay for things, but does not steal either. Freegans like to find things that other people throw away that are still useful. People often throw things away that are not used up or broken. Sometimes they throw things away because they are bored of them and like to shop for new things. Freegans look through other people's rubbish bins and take what they can use, to the point of dumpster diving. This can be good for the environment, because no energy is used to make new things, in those cases. However, some cities have rules about taking things out of the rubbish, and freegans can get in trouble for this.
The name "freegan" rhymes with "vegan". It combines the words "free" and "vegan". Freegans are not necessarily vegans.

Electrology is an electrical process to remove human hair so that it does not grow back. An electrologist is sometimes called an electrolysist in the United Kingdom. The process of removing the hair is referred to as electrolysis. The electrolysist slides a thin metal probe into each hair follicle. This, if done the right way, does not hurt the skin. Electricity flows to the follicle through the probe. This causes damage to the areas that grow hair so that it does not grow back.

CATW is an international NGO having Category II Consultative Status with ECOSOC with branches in many world regions. 

Janice Raymond has been in the forefront of the campaign to get prostitution recognized as violence against women and one of the most entrenched forms of gender inequality. Organizing projects and testifying in many different parts of the world opposing legalization of the sex industry, Raymond has encouraged governments instead to provide services and alternatives for women in prostitution and to legislate against the purchase of women and children for sexual activities. Raymond has promoted innovative prevention projects in different countries that discourage the demand for prostitution, a root cause of sex trafficking, challenging young men to a different standard of masculinity and enlisting them in the campaign against sexual exploitation. 

Dr. Raymond has been the recipient of grants from the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. National Institute of Justice, the National Science Foundation, USIA, the Ford Foundation, the Norwegian Organization for Research and Development (NORAD), and UNESCO.

Janice Raymond has also served as an expert witness to legal challenges promoting decriminalization of the sex industry. 

Dr. Raymond is the author of five books and multiple articles, translated into several languages, on issues ranging from violence against women, women’s health, feminist theory and bio-medicine. She has published numerous articles on prostitution and sex trafficking. She lectures internationally on all these topics.

Energy efficiency

Energy efficiency is using less energy to provide the same level of energy service. An example would be insulating a home to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve the same temperature. Another example would be installing fluorescent lights and/or skylights instead of incandescent bulbs to attain the same level of illumination. So efficient energy use is achieved primarily by means of a more efficient technology rather than by changes in individual behaviour.

Energy conservation is using less energy to achieve a lesser energy service, and usually involves a change in behavior. Examples would be heating a room less in winter, or driving less, or working in a less brightly lit room. 

As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.

Anchorage was originally a construction camp during the building of the Alaska Railroad. By 1920 it had grown to the point where it was decided to officially make it a city. Being at the head of Cook Inlet it became an important place for shipping in Alaska because ships could load and unload cargo to and from the new railroad. In the 1940 an both the army and the air force built bases near Anchorage, and it got even bigger. In 1964 Anchorage was hit by the Good Friday Earthquake, the second strongest earthquake ever recorded. Over a hundred people died and a lot of buildings in and around Anchorage were destroyed. Over the next few years a lot of work went into rebuilding the city and making the buildings better in case there was another earthquake. In 1968 oil was discovered up in the Arctic region of Alaska, and Anchorage again got bigger quickly and merged with other towns in the area. Today it is a modern city with a very large international airport, a large sea port that is very busy, and all the other things you would expect to find in a big city.

Crater Lake is a caldera lake in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is the main attraction of Crater Lake National Park. It is famous for its blue color and clear water. The lake partly fills a nearly 4,000 feet (1,220 meters) deep caldera that was formed by the collapse of the volcano, Mount Mazama. This happened about 7,700 years ago.

There are no rivers flowing into or out of the lake; the evaporation is compensated for by rain and snowfall at a rate such that the total amount of water is replaced every 250 years.

John Wesley Hillman was the first European to discover Crater Lake. He named the lake "Deep Blue Lake". The lake was renamed at least three times, as Blue Lake, Lake Majesty, and lastly Crater Lake.

Crater Lake is known for its famous piece of driftwood, named the "Old Man of the Lake." It is a tree that has been moving up and down in the water for more than 100 years. Due to the cold water of the lake, the tree has been well preserved.

While having no native fish population, the lake was stocked up with various fish between the years of 1888 and 1941. Several species of fish are still in the lake to this day.

Gribbles, shipworms and bacteria decompose the wood and gradually turn it into nutrients that are reintroduced to the food web. Sometimes, the partially decomposed wood washes ashore, where it also shelters birds, plants, and other species. Driftwood can become the foundation for sand dunes.

According to Norse mythology, the first humans, Ask and Embla, were formed out of two pieces of driftwood, an ash and an elm, by the god Odin and his brothers, Ve and Vili. 

Driftwood carried by Arctic rivers was the main, or sometimes only, source of wood for some Inuit and other Arctic populations living north of the tree-line until they came into regular contact with European traders. 
Many people use driftwood as parts of decorative furniture or other art forms, and it is a popular element in the scenery of fish tanks.

Highway is a word used to describe roads made for travel by the public between important places, such as cities, towns and landmarks. The word highway can also be different between countries, and can mean a road, freeway, superhighway, autoroute, autobahn, parkway, expressway, autostrasse, autostrada, byway, or motorway.

Highways come in many different designs. They can include many lanes of traffic, a median (strip of lane or barrier) between lanes of opposing traffic, and access control (ramps and bridges). Highways can also be as simple as a two-lane road.

In many countries, these roads are numbered to easily tell them apart. These numbered highways are usually called routes. The United States includes a system called the Interstate Highway system, controlled by AASHTO, where major north/south routes are odd numbered and east/west are even numbered. In Canada, routes that are in the 400s are freeways. In China, types of routes are separated by the first letter of the route; "G" for national road, "S" for provincial road and "Y" for rural roads.

Highways are sometimes criticised because of the pollution cars make when driving highways. When too many cars travel along a highway, traffic slows down; this is known as a traffic jam. Public transportation (such as buses) and special lanes for those who have a given number of people in a car are used to help stop these problems.

Beverly Cleary

Beverly Cleary (born April 12, 1916) is the author of over 80 books for young adults and children. Her characters are normal children facing challenges of growing up, and her stories are filled with humour. Some of her best known and loved characters are Ramona Quimby and her sister Beatrice ("Beezus"), Henry Huggins, Ralph S. Mouse, and Ribsy.

Beverly Cleary was born Beverly Atlee Bunn in McMinnville, Oregon. When she was 6, her family moved to Portland, Oregon, where she went to grammar and high school. She was slow in learning to read, partly because she did not like the books the school wanted her to read, and partly due to an unkind first grade teacher. It was not until she was in third grade that she found enjoyment from books, when she started reading "The Dutch Twins" by Lucy Fitch Perkins. From then on, she visited the library often, though she rarely found the books she most wanted to read — those about children like herself.

In 1934, she moved to Ontario, California to attend Chaffey College, from which she earned an Associate of Arts diploma. She then moved to Berkeley to major in English at the University of California. After graduating with a B.A in English in 1938, she studied at the School of Librarianship at the University of Washington in Seattle, where she earned a degree in librarianship in 1939. Her first job was as a librarian in Yakima, Washington, where she met many children who were looking for the same books that she had always hoped to find as a child herself. In response, she wrote her first book, "Henry Huggins," which was published in 1950. "Beezus and Ramona", Cleary's first novel to feature the Quimby sisters as the central focus of the story, was published in 1955, although Beezus and Ramona made frequent appearances in the Henry Huggins series as supporting characters.

In 1940 she married Clarence T. Cleary and they moved to Oakland, California. The Clearys became parents to a set of twins, Marianne Elisabeth and Malcolm James, in 1955. Clarence Cleary died in 2004. Beverly Cleary currently lives in Carmel, California.

She has also written two autobiographies, "A Girl from Yamhill" and "My Own Two Feet".

Her books are available in 14 languages in over 20 countries. She has won many awards, including the 1984 Newbery Medal for her book "Dear Mr. Henshaw" and the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award in 1975. Cleary received the Library of Congress "Living Legends" award in the "Writers and Artists" category in April 2000 for her major contributions to America's cultural heritage.

The Hollywood location of the Multnomah County library, near where she lived as a child, has created a map on their lobby wall of Henry Huggins' Klickitat Street neighborhood. Statues of her beloved characters Ramona, Henry Huggins, and the Huggins' dog Ribsy can be found in Grant Park in Portland, Oregon.

In 2004, the University of Washington's Information School completed fundraising for a Beverly Cleary Endowed Chair for Children and Youth Services to remember her work and commitment to librarianship.

She has a dorm at University of California, Berkeley named after her.

Amy Winehouse

Amy Jade Winehouse (14 September 1983 - 23 July 2011) was a Grammy award winning English soul and R&B singer and songwriter. She was born to a family of jazz musicians and raised in London, England. She was signed to Island Records, and released two albums "Frank" (2003) and "Back to Black" (2006). Winehouse became known for using illegal drugs, and for mental health problems. On 23 July 2011 Winehouse was found dead in her London home.

The tabloid press regularly reported on the singer's problems with drugs and alcohol, as well as her self-destructive behaviour. She was married to Blake Fielder-Civil from 2007 until he divorced her in 2009. They were plagued by legal troubles that resulted in criminal convictions for both of them. He was sent to prison. In 2008, Winehouse had some health problems that threatened both her career and her life.

At 3:54 pm BST (14:54 UTC) on 23 July 2011, two ambulances were called to Winehouse's home in Camden, London. Shortly afterwards, the Metropolitan Police said that she was dead. An inquest to determine the cause of death is taking place. A commander of the Metropolitan Police said the death was unexplained. After her death media and camera crews appeared as crowds gathered near Winehouse’s home. Forensic investigators entered the flat as police blocked off the street outside. Her record label, Universal, made a statement that read in part: "We are deeply saddened at the sudden loss of such a gifted musician, artist and performer."

A post-mortem examination, where a doctor examined her body to find out the cause of her death, was held on 25 July 2011. As a post-mortem involves blood tests as well as physical examination, the cause of death will likely not be known for some weeks. Toxicological reports were published on 24 August. It says that she did not have any illegal drugs in her blood when she died. More detailed reports will be published in October.

Canuck

"Canuck" is a slang term for Canadian people.

The term was first used in the 19th century, although its etymology (origin) is not clear. Some possibilities are:

The Random House Dictionary says that: "The term Canuck is first recorded about 1835 as an Americanism, originally referring specifically to a French Canadian. This was probably the original meaning, though in Canada and other countries, Canuck now more often refers to any Canadian." 

When "Canuck" is used by Canadians, the meaning is usually affectionate, friendly or patriotic. 

The history and use of the term include:

The use of "Canuck" is similar to the use of some other potentially offensive nicknames. When it is used by the people it names — Canadians in this case — it is usually acceptable. But when it is used by an outsider — in this case particularly Americans — it can be thought of as insulting one's heritage. Although it is not as severe as most ethnic slurs, some consider it one - just as Yankee can be.

Charles Kirk Clarke (c. 1857 - January 20 1924) was a psychiatrist who had a big role in Canadian politics. He was born in Elora, Ontario, to a former parliamentarian. He went to college at the University of Toronto in 1879. He later went on to found the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene. Clarke first practised psychiatry at the 999 Queen Street institution in Toronto. In 1880, then took a post at the Hamilton asylum.

Clarke was a student and brother-in-law of Joseph Workman, Superintendent of the Toronto Asylum. By 1905, Clarke had abandoned the movement, and many of the other leading psychiatrists would follow suit by the end of World War I, when it was clear that eugenic measures were not having the desired effects.

The Internationale

"The Internationale" (French:L'Internationale, pronounced [], Russian:С Интернационалом [S Internatsionalom], Chinese:國際歌 [Pinyin:Guójìgē]) is a very well known French socialist, communist, and anarchist song. The Russian and Chinese versions are also very famous. The Russian version, written by Аркадий Яковлевич Коц (Arkady Yakolevich Kots), was, before 1944, the national anthem of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The French words, written by Eugene Pottier, were originally supposed to be sung to the tune of "La Marseillaise", but a separate tune was created for it by a Belgian named Pierre Degeyter. The song is known by its tune, and its chorus, "C'est la Lutte Finale / Groupons-nous, et demain / L'Internationale / Sera le genre humain". The Chinese lyrics were written by 瞿秋白, or Qu Qiubai.

Hartley, Kent

Hartley is a village in Kent, England. It is 6 miles south of Gravesend and Dartford. The old church is called All Saints.

Hartley has many new buildings and some old houses, it now joins Longfield, the place in the north. In 2001 there were 5,395 persons living here. There are also woods and a farm near the houses. Most of the 2,145 houses in Hartley are owned by the persons who live in them.

The name Hartley means "place in the wood where the deer are". It was a very small place, but now is like a town. No great events happened here, and not many famous persons lived in Hartley.

In the Cretaceous time, much of England was under the sea. In the deep waters, the chalk of the North Downs of Kent was made. Then the sea made the clay which is over the chalk. Then the Ice Age froze the chalk and there were rivers which made the "dry valley" at Hartley Bottom.

In the year 1086, 15 families and 3 slaves lived in Hartley. Before the Black Death (1348) about 150 persons lived here. 53 persons made tax payments in 1377, which means about 85 lived here then. In 1392 a paper tells us that there was a chief house, where a manager lived. He farmed land for the owner. This land was called Hartley Court. Other persons who owned land in Hartley, had to go to the court of the owner and do some other work for him. 
There was a fight at Hartley Wood in 1554, between supporters and opponents of Queen Mary I of England. Her supporters won. Hartley in 1650 was like the place in 1850, because almost all the buildings were there then. In 1770 the writer Edward Hasted said not many persons go to Hartley.

Some buildings were made in the 1700s (like Hartley House and Yew Cottage). In 1841 there were 224 persons living in Hartley. Almost all worked on the farms. There was also a wheel maker, metal worker and drink sellers.

The growth of Hartley started after the railway came to Longfield in 1876, and water by pipe came in 1902. Next two companies – Payne, Trapps and Co Ltd, and Small Owners Limited sold land for houses and small farms. After 1945 there were many new houses and roads.

Gribble

A gribble is any species of marine isopod from the family Limnoriidae. They are mostly pale white and small (1-4  mm long) crustaceans. 

The term gribble was originally used for the wood-boring species, especially the first species described from Norway by Rathke in 1799, "Limnoria lignorum". The Limnoriidae are now known to include seaweed and seagrass borers, as well as wood borers. 

There are three genera, "Paralimnoria", "Limnoria" and "Lynseia". "Limnoria" has species in most seas. Those gribbles able to bore into living marine plants are thought to have evolved from a wood (dead plant) boring species. 

Gribbles bore into wood and plant material for as food. The cellulose of wood is digested, most likely with the aid of cellulases produced by the gribbles themselves. The most destructive species are "Limnoria lignorum", "L. tripunctata" and "L. quadripunctata".

According to an expert, they are the only animals able to make a cellulase to dissolve plant cell walls. Other animals that eat plant fibres make use of bacteria in their gut to produce the enzyme. Gribbles do not. This has led some biologists to think of biofuels.

Tuatara

The Tuatara are reptiles which look like lizards. However, they are the only surviving member of an order of reptiles which flourished 200 million years ago. 

There is now only the genus Sphenodon, with two species of Tuatara. Both are endemic to (only live in) New Zealand. Lizards and snakes are the closest living relatives of the tuatara. 

Tuatara are green-brown, and measure up to 80 cm from head to the end of their tail. They have a spiny crest along the back: the Maori word "tuatara" refers to this.
The crest is more pronounced in males. Tuatara are special in many ways. One of these is the pattern of their teeth. They have two rows of teeth in the upper jaw overlap one row on the lower jaw. This is unique among living species. 

Tuatara are also unusual because they have a third 'eye'. They have two normal eyes. The third eye is on top of their head, in between their other eyes. It does not see like a normal eye. The parietal eye, as it is called, is only visible in hatchlings. They have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months this becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. 

The function of the parietal eye is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to manufacture vitamin D. It may also do other things. Of all living tetrapods, the parietal eye is most obvious in this animal. The parietal eye is part of the pineal system. The animal's pineal gland secretes melatonin at night. Some salamanders use their pineal body to perceive polarised light, which helps navigation. Unlike lizards they have no eardrums or external male sexual organ.

Tuataras do not have ears, but they can hear. They have a number of unique features in their skeleton (bones), some of them shared through common descent with fish.

The tuatara has been classified as an endangered species since 1895 (the second species, "S. guntheri", was not known until 1989).
Tuatara, like many of New Zealand's native animals, are threatened by habitat loss and the introduced Polynesian Rat "Rattus exulans". They were extinct on the mainland, with the remaining populations confined to 32 offshore islands, until the first mainland release into the heavily fenced and monitored Karori Wildlife Sanctuary in 2005.

Hüsker Dü was an American hardcore punk and later alternative rock band from the 1980s. The band formed in 1979 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The people in the band were Bob Mould who sang and played electric guitar, Greg Norton who played bass guitar and Grant Hart who sang and played drums. The band stopped playing together in 1987.

The band's sound changed very much over the years they were together, but it was always very loud and powerful. The band began as a hardcore band. They played extremely loud and very fast and often screamed their vocals instead of singing. As time went on, the songs began to get slower and more melodic. By the time the band had stopped playing together, their music was no longer punk rock and had changed to alternative rock.

Hüsker Dü always had more than one singer. This is because the band decided early in their time together that whoever wrote the lyrics of a song would sing that song. This meant that many of the songs were be very different from each other, but it also caused fights within the band. In 1987, the band stopped playing together because of these fights.

Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael

Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael applied the "Daubert" standard to expert testimony from non-scientists.

Patrick Carmichael was driving his minivan on July 6, 1993, when the right rear tire blew out. One of the passengers in the vehicle died, and others were severely injured. Three months later, the Carmichaels sued the manufacturer of the tire, claiming that the tire was defective and the defect caused the accident. The Carmichaels' case rested largely on testimony from a tire failure expert.

The tire failure expert relied on features of tire technology that the manufacturer did not dispute, as well as background facts about the particular tire on the Carmichaels' van. The expert's conclusion that a defect in the tire caused the accident rested on certain observations about the tire that Kumho Tire vigorously disputed. Kumho also disagreed with certain aspects of the tire expert's methodology, and asked the federal district court hearing the case to exclude it under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.

The district court took its cue from Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, which had solidified a gatekeeping role for trial judges in admitting expert testimony. Under Daubert, certain factors contribute to the reliability, and hence the admissibility, of expert testimony, one of which is the general validity of the expert's methods. The district court found the tire expert's methods not to be scientifically valid, and hence excluded his testimony. This meant that Kumho Tire would prevail. The Carmichaels appealed to the Eleventh Circuit.

The Eleventh Circuit reversed the district court's ruling in favor of Kumho Tire. It reasoned that Daubert was expressly limited only to scientific expert testimony and did not apply to "skill- or experience-based observation." The tire expert's testimony rested on observation and experience, and so the Eleventh Circuit reasoned the district court should have made a different ruling based on Rule 702 without the Daubert gloss. Kumho Tire asked the Supreme Court to review whether Daubert applied solely to scientific evidence.

Water polo is a team game. Two teams play a match, which consists of four periods named "quarters". The length of each period is usually between 5 to 8 minutes, but because the amount of time spent on fouls or out throws is not counted in the quarter time, an average quarter lasts around 12 minutes 'real time'.

Each team consists of six field players and one goalkeeper. Water polo players need to be skilled in swimming, ball handing skills, reflexes and awareness.

Fishstick

Fishsticks or fish fingers are a type of food probably invented in the United Kingdom. They are made of a whitefish like cod that is battered and breaded. They are often eaten with tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, or ketchup. "Fishsticks" are popular with children and their parents as an easy-to-prepare finger food that is somewhat healthy for kids.

Fishsticks first came about as a result of the invention of the plate froster in 1929, the first quick freezer. To ensure rapid freezing, food needed to be in slim rectangular . A suitable candidate for this freezing method was fishsticks, cut from large fish then dipped in bread crumbs for frying.

In Britain in the 1950s, most of the herring catch was pickled and exported to other North European countries. In an attempt to make herring more appealing on the home market, companies tried to present it in a new way, creating herring fishsticks called “herring savouries” and were tested on the market against a bland control product of cod sticks, sold as “fish fingers.” Shoppers in Southampton and South Wales, showed an overwhelming preference for the cod. Cod fishsticks were first produced in Great Yarmouth and introduced in Britain on 26 September 1955. They became immensely popular after television advertising began in 1956. To this day, fish sticks are a favorite food among children.

On modern production lines, headless fish are processed through a machine that removes a fillet from each side of the backbone. The fillets then pass over a wheel and a blade that separates the skin from the flesh. Machine filleting leaves a few pin-like bones in the fillet, so the flesh containing the bones is cut out.

Fillets are formed into frozen blocks. A conveyor sends the blanks through batter and breadcrumbs, doubling the thickness of the fishstick. Then each is passed through a hot vegetable oil bath for about one minute to seal the coating and allow the fishstick to be grilled or fried. Then the fishstick is frozen again, with the center reaching -4°F/-20°C in less than 20 minutes. After packaging, it is stored at -18°F/-28°C, ready for distribution.

Antarctic krill

Antarctic krill ("Euphausia superba") is a species of krill that lives in the Antarctic waters of the Southern Ocean. They are shrimp-like and belong to the invertebrates. 

They live in large schools, called swarms. Sometimes these swarms have a density of 10,000–30,000 individual animals per cubic meter. 

They feed directly on very small phytoplankton, so they can use the energy that the phytoplankton originally got from the sun in order to sustain their life in the open ocean. They grow to a length of 6 cm, weigh up to 2 g, and can live for up to six years. They are a key species in the Antarctic ecosystem and are, in terms of biomass, probably the most successful animal species on the planet (approximately 500 million tonnes).

In aquaria, krill have been observed to eat each other.

Colorimeter

A colorimeter is a device used for measuring colours, or colorimetry. It measures the absorbance of different wavelengths of light in a solution. It can be used to measure the concentration of a known solute.

Different chemical substances absorb different wavelengths of light. When the concentration of the solute is higher, it absorbs more light in a specific wavelength. This is known as the Beer-Lambert law.

The most important parts of a colorimeter are:

Different filters are used to select the wavelength of light which the solution absorbs the most. This makes the colorimeter more accurate. Solutions are usually placed in glass or plastic cuvettes. The usual wavelengths used are between 400 and 700 nanometers. If it is necessary to use ultraviolet light (below 400 nanometers) then the lamp and filters must be changed.

The output of the colorimeter may be shown in graphs or tables, by an analogue or digital meter. The data may be printed on paper, or stored in a computer. It either shows the amount of light which is absorbed by the solution, or the amount of light which has passed through the solution.

Mount Cayley, located 11 km southeast of Callaghan Lake and 24 west of Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. It is an eroded stratovolcano and is part of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt which is a segment of the Cascade Volcanic Arc.

A scenario of an eruption of Mount Cayley shows how western Canada is vulnerable to an eruption. The scenario is based on past activity in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and involves both effusive and explosive eruptions. The scenario impact is largely a result of the concentration of vulnerable infrastructure in valleys.

In 2003, Catherine Hickson, a scientist with the Geological Survey of Canada, was one of the three scientists to report on the hypothetical eruption at Mount Cayley. The first signs of activity at the volcano would probably be enlarged seismic activity in and close to the mountain. Flooding would turn out to be a huge issue for the community of Squamish and could eventually overrun parts of Highway 99.

The Mount Cayley volcanic field is named after Mount Cayley.

Illusion

An illusion is a distortion of how things seem to be. It shows how the brain normally arranges, sorts, and explains stimulation of the senses. Illusions can change the way reality seems to be. In general, they are shared by most people. Illusions can happen with all five senses (taste, touch, sight, smell, and hearing). Some illusions happen because of disorders.

An illusion is different from a hallucination; a halucination is sensing something which is not real, but an illusion is interpreting what we sense wrongly.

They are the most known and understood. The brain doesn’t understand information the eye takes in. The brain makes wrong guesses about what the eye sees.

They are illusions that are heard. The person listening hears sounds that aren’t really there, or sounds that can’t really happen. A Shepard tone is an auditory illusion.

They are when a person feels something that isn’t there, or something that shouldn’t be there but feels like it is. This happens sometimes when a person loses his arm. The person still feels like the arm is there. They might want to scratch the arm, or the arm might hurt them. This can happen with any limb of the body, and it is called the phantom limb.

The party works in Armenia and in countries where the Armenian diaspora is active, notably in Lebanon and the ethnically Armenian-dominated de facto Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

The Armenian Revolutionary Federation History Museum was created during an official ceremony Friday 2007 at Yerevan's Kristapor Mikaelian Center, with the party's leaders and supporters on hand to mark this momentous occasion.

Opened in 1946, the ARF History Museum was in Paris and during the years has collected more than 3,000 artifacts describing the party's history. After the ARF's return to Armenia, the museum and the ARF archives have been sent to Armenia.

Varasdates or Varazdat (, Varazdat) was an Armenian prince who succeeded his uncle King Papes as King of Armenia in 374.

Following the murder of King Papes, Valens sent Varazdat, a nephew of Pap, a young man highly reputed for his mental and physical gifts, to hold the Armenian throne. Shapur II, having failed on the battlefield, now proposed to Valens in 375 that Armenia be divided between the two powers. The Emperor rejected the proposal, but sent Victor Magistrianus to the Persian King to discuss the question. This emissary was cozened into exceeding the bounds of his authority and agreeing to the Persian proposal. In the meantime, the internal condition of Armenia was imperiled through friction between King Varazdat and the nakharars, culminating in the assassination of Musel Mamikonian, the leader of the latters' party. Manuel, the son of Musel, took up arms against the King and compelled him to flee from Armenia in 378, after four years of reign. Varazdat's life was saved, but the country was thrown into confusion. The Persians took advantage of the turmoil and invaded Armenia; but their occupation was a short-lived one. Shapur II died in 379, and the Persians evacuated in haste. Manuel, the dynamic Mamikonian, had rallied a formidable national force for action.

Chosen alongside Kocaeli for Turkey, Adana scored the most points for cost effectiveness against Kocaeli's points for infrastructure development, while Adana and Kocaeli tied on points for the categories of human resources and quality of life.

Parsley Massacre

In October of 1937, Dominican dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina ordered the execution of the Haitian population living within the borderlands with Haiti. The violence resulted in the killing of 17,000 to 35,000 Haitian civilians over a span of approximately five days. This would later become known as the Parsley Massacre.

Trujillo had made his actions for the Haitian community clear in a short speech given at a dance held in his honor on October 2, 1937 in Dajabón, stating:

Heat pump

A heat pump is a machine that moves heat from one place to another.

A refrigerator is a heat pump.
It moves heat from the inside to the outside.
This keeps the food inside cold, so it will not spoil.

An air conditioner is a heat pump.
It moves heat from the inside of a building to the outside.

A Peltier device is a heat pump.
It moves heat from one side to the other by means of an electric current.

Some buildings are heated with heat pumps, also.
In the winter, the heat pump moves heat from the outside to the inside. Sometimes this works better than heating with a radiator.

Usually, heat flows from a hot place to a cold place, according to the second law of thermodynamics.
Heat will not move from a cold place to a warmer place by itself.
Because of this, a heat pump must use extra energy to move the heat.
This is sort of like pumping water uphill.

Most heat pumps use electric motors to provide energy.
Some heat pumps use heat energy, supplied by a flame or an electric heater.
Most heat pumps use a refrigeration cycle.
A refrigeration cycle uses a fluid which moves through tubes and carries the heat.
The fluid is called a refrigerant.
During the refrigeration cycle, the refrigerant changes from a liquid to a gas and back to a liquid.

When the refrigerant changes from a liquid to a gas, it gains (absorbs) heat energy.
This is just like boiling.
When the refrigerant changes from a gas back to a liquid, it loses heat energy.

The heat pump is set up so that the refrigerant gains heat from one place that will be cooled, and moves it to another place that will be warmed.

A heat pump forces the refrigerant to change from a gas to a liquid.
It uses a compressor to do this.
Often, an electric motor drives the compressor.
The compressor compresses the refrigerant, and this makes it change from a gas to a liquid.
When the refrigerant changes from a gas to a liquid, it also gives up some of the heat that it has been carrying.

At the other end of the cycle, the refrigerant boils again.
It changes from a liquid to a gas.
But it needs heat to do this.
When it takes up heat from its surroundings, it cools them down.
So where the refrigerant is changing from a liquid to a gas, it feels cooler.

This is the complete cycle, from the cooling side to the heating side:
On the cooling side, heat is taken up to boil the refrigerant from a liquid to a gas.
Then the fluid moves to the heating side.
There, the compressor forces the refrigerant back to a liquid again.
This makes it give up its heat.
So heat has moved from the cooling side to the heating side.
Then, the cycle repeats.

If the cooling side is the inside of a refrigerator, it gets cold.

If the cooling side is the inside of a building, and the warming side is the outside of the building, the inside of the building gets cold. This is how an air conditioner works.

If the cooling side is the outside of the building, and the warming side is the inside of the building, this is how a heat pump can heat a building during the winter.

Second law of thermodynamics

The second law of thermodynamics means that entropy increases. In other words: over time, differences in temperature, pressure, and density tend to even out.

This law is valid only in a physical system that is isolated from the outside world. Entropy is a measure of how far along this evening-out process has come.

The most common wording for the second law of thermodynamics is essentially due to "Rudolf Clausius":

There are many statements of the second law which use different terms, but are all equivalent. Another statement by Clausius is:

Heat cannot of itself pass from a colder to a hotter body.

An equivalent statement by Lord Kelvin is:

A transformation whose only final result is to convert heat, extracted from a source at constant temperature, into work, is impossible. 

The second law is only applicable to macroscopic systems. The second law is actually a statement about the "probable" behavior of an isolated system. As larger and larger systems are considered, the probability of the second law being practically true becomes more and more certain. For any isolated system with a mass of more than a few picograms, the second law is true to within a few parts in a million.
In a general sense, the second law says that temperature differences between systems in contact with each other tend to even out and that work can be obtained from these non-equilibrium differences, but that loss of heat occurs, in the form of entropy, when work is done. Pressure differences, density differences, and particularly temperature differences, all tend to equalize if given the opportunity. This means that an isolated system will eventually come to have a uniform temperature. A heat engine is a mechanical device that provides useful work from the difference in temperature of two bodies.

<doc id="63083" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63083" title="Air conditioner">
Air conditioner

An air conditioner is a system, or machine that removes heat from an area using a cycle in which heat is moved out of the area where it is hot. 

In construction, a complete system of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning is referred to as HVAC. Its purpose, in the home or in the car, is to provide comfort during hot days and nights. 

The 19th century British scientist and inventor Michael Faraday discovered that compressing and liquefying ammonia could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed to evaporate. 

In 1842, Philippines physician Dr. John Gorrie used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients. He hoped eventually to use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings. He even thought of centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities. 

Air conditioning engineers broadly divide air conditioning applications into "comfort" and "process". 

Comfort applications aim to provide an indoor environment that remains relatively constant in a range preferred by humans despite changes in external weather conditions or in internal heat loads. 

Process applications aim to provide a suitable environment for a process being carried out, regardless of internal heat loads and external weather conditions. Although often in the comfort range, it is the needs of the process that determine conditions, not human preference. Process applications include:






In both comfort and process applications not only is the objective to control temperature (although in some comfort applications this is all that is controlled) but other factors including humidity, air movement and air quality.

In the refrigeration cycle, a heat pump transfers heat from a lower temperature heat source into a higher temperature heat sink. Heat would naturally flow in the opposite direction. This is the most common type of air conditioning. 
A refrigerator works in much the same way, as it pumps the heat out of the interior into the room in which it stands.

This cycle takes advantage of the universal gas law "PV" = "nRT", where "P" is pressure, "V" is volume, "R" is the universal gas constant, "T" is temperature, and "n" is the number of moles of gas (1 mole = 6.022×10 molecules).

The most common refrigeration cycle uses an electric motor to drive a compressor. In an automobile the compressor is driven by a pulley on the engine's crankshaft, with both using electric motors for air circulation. Since evaporation occurs when heat is absorbed, and condensation occurs when heat is released, air conditioners are designed to use a compressor to cause pressure changes between two compartments, and actively pump a refrigerant around. A refrigerant is pumped into the cooled compartment (the evaporator coil), where the low pressure causes the refrigerant to evaporate into a vapor, taking heat with it. In the other compartment (the condenser), the refrigerant vapour is compressed and forced through another heat exchange coil, condensing into a liquid, rejecting the heat previously absorbed from the cooled space.

Air conditioning has no greater influence on health than heating—that is to say, very little—although poorly maintained air-conditioning systems (especially large, centralized systems) can occasionally promote the growth and spread of microorganisms, such as "Legionella pneumophila," the infectious agent responsible for Legionnaire's disease. Air conditioning can have a positive effect on sufferers of allergies and asthma.

In serious heat waves, air conditioning can save the lives of the elderly. Some local authorities even set up public cooling centers for the benefit of those without air conditioning at home.

First law of thermodynamics

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed. The law forms the basis of the principal of conservation of energy. It follows from the law that when machines use energy, the machines convert the energy from one kind energy to another. Energy cannot be created and never goes away. Energy just changes its form. People can use the changes to do work that is useful.

The law means that the total energy of the universe is a constant. However, energy can be transferred from one part of the universe to another. 

The most common wording of the first law of thermodynamics used by scientists is:

James Prescott Joule was the first person who found out by experiments that heat and work are convertible.

The first explicit statement of the first law of thermodynamics was given by "Rudolf Clausius" in 1850: "There is a state function E, called 'energy', whose differential equals the work exchanged with the surroundings during an adiabatic process."

In thermodynamics and engineering, it is natural to think of the system as a heat engine which does work on the surroundings, and to state that the total energy added by heating is equal to the sum of the increase in internal energy plus the work done by the system. Hence formula_1 is the amount of energy lost by the system due to work done by the system on its surroundings. During the portion of the thermodynamic cycle where the engine is doing work, formula_1 is positive, but there will always be a portion of the cycle where formula_1 is negative, e.g., when the working gas is being compressed. When formula_1 represents the work done by the system, the first law is written:

People disagree whether energy is a positive or a negative number. So that formula_6 is the flow of heat out of the system, and formula_1 is the work into the system:

Because of this ambiguity, it is very important in any discussion involving the first law to explicitly establish the sign convention in use.

<doc id="63093" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63093" title="Conservation of energy">
Conservation of energy

In physics, the conservation of energy means that the total amount of energy in an isolated system remains constant, although it may change forms, e.g. friction turns kinetic energy into thermal energy. In thermodynamics, the first law of thermodynamics is a statement of the conservation of energy for thermodynamic systems. In short, the law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to another, such as when electrical energy is changed into heat energy. 

From a mathematical point of view, the energy conservation law is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time; energy conservation is a result of the empirical fact that the laws of physics do not change with time itself. Philosophically this can be stated as "nothing depends on time per se".

Ancient philosophers as far back as Thales of Miletus had the idea that there is some underlying substance of which everything is made. But that is not the same as our concept of "mass-energy" today (For example, Thales thought the underlying substance was water).
In 1638, Galileo published his analysis of several situations. This included the famous "interrupted pendulum". This can be described (in modernized language) as conservatively converting potential energy to kinetic energy and back again. However, Galileo did not explain the process in modern terms and had not understod the modern concept either. The German Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz during 1676-1689 attempted a mathematical formulation of the kind of energy which is connected with "motion" (kinetic energy). Leibniz noticed that in many mechanical systems (of several masses, "m" each with velocity "v" ),

was conserved so long as the masses did not interact. He called this quantity the "vis viva" or "living force" of the system. The principle represents an accurate statement of the approximate conservation of kinetic energy in situations where there is no friction. 
Meanwhile, in 1843 James Prescott Joule independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. In the most famous, now called the "Joule apparatus", a descending weight attached to a string caused a paddle immersed in water to rotate. He showed that the gravitational potential energy lost by the weight in descending was equal to the thermal energy (heat) gained by the water by friction with the paddle.

Over the period 1840-1843, similar work was carried out by engineer Ludwig A. Colding though it was little-known outside his native Denmark.

Both Joule's and Mayer's work suffered from resistance and neglect but it was Joule's that, perhaps unjustly, eventually drew the wider recognition.

<doc id="63095" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63095" title="Differences between butterflies and moths">
Differences between butterflies and moths

The Lepidoptera are often split into the two groups, butterflies and moths. Butterflies are a natural monophyletic group. They are often placed in the suborder Rhopalocera, which includes Papilionoidea (true butterflies), Hesperiidae (skippers), and Hedylidae (butterfly moths). In this taxonomic scheme, moths belong to the suborder Heterocera. Other taxonomic schemes have been proposed; the most common putting the butterflies into the suborder Ditrysia and then the "super-family" Papilionoidea, and ignoring a classification for moths. None of the taxonomic schemes is perfect however, and taxonomists commonly argue over how to define the obvious differences between butterflies and moths.

The most obvious difference is in the feelers, or antennae. Most butterflies have thin slender filamentous antennae which are club shaped at the end. Moths, on the other hand, often have comb-like or feathery antennae, or filamentous and unclubbed. This distinction is the basis for the earliest taxonomic divisions in the Lepidoptera - the Rhopalocera ("clubbed horn", the butterflies) and the Heterocera ("varied horn", the moths). 

There are, however, exceptions to this rule and a few moths (the family Castniidae) have clubbed antennae. Some butterflies, like "Pseudopontia paradoxa" from the forests of central Africa, lack the clubbed ends. The "Hesperiids" often have an angle to the tip of the antenna.

Many moths have a "frenulum" which is a filament arising from the hindwing and coupling with barbs on the forewing. The frenulum can be observed only when a specimen is in hand. Some moths have a lobe on the forewing called a "jugum" that helps in coupling with the hindwing. Butterflies however lack these structures.

Most moth caterpillars spin a cocoon made of silk within which they metamorphose into the pupal stage. Most butterflies on the other hand form an exposed pupa which is also termed a chrysalis. 

However there are many exceptions to this rule, for example the Hawk moths form an exposed chrysalis which is underground. Gypsy moths sometimes form butterfly-style pupae, hanging on twigs or tree bark, although usually they create flimsy cocoons out of silk strands and a few leaves, partially exposing the chrysalis. A few Skipper butterfly larvae also make crude cocoons in which they pupate, exposing the pupa a bit. The "Parnassius" butterfly larvae make a flimsy cocoon for pupation and they pupate near the ground surface between debris.
Most butterflies have bright colours on their wings. Nocturnal moths on the other hand are usually plain brown, grey, white or black and often with obscuring patterns of zigzags or swirls which help camouflage them as they rest during the day. However many day-flying moths are brightly coloured, particularly if they are toxic. A few butterflies are quite plain, like the Cabbage White butterfly.

Moths tend to have stout and hairy or furry-looking bodies. Butterflies on the other hand have slender and smoother abdomens. Moths have larger scales on their wings. These make them look more dense and fluffy. Butterflies on the other hand have fine scales. This difference is possibly due to the need for moths to conserve heat during the cooler nights whereas butterflies are able to absorb solar radiation.

Most moths are nocturnal or crepuscular while most butterflies are diurnal. There are however exceptions, including the diurnal Gypsy moth and the spectacular "Uraniidae" or Sunset moths.

Moths usually rest with their wings spread out to their sides. Butterflies frequently fold their wings above their backs when they are perched although they will occasionally "bask" with their wings spread for short periods. However some butterflies, like the skippers, may hold their wings either flat or folded or even in-between (the so-called "jet plane" position) when perched. Most moths also occasionally fold their wings above their backs when they are in a certain spot (like when there is no room to fully spread their wings). A sometimes confusing family can be the "Geometridae" (such as the Winter moth) because the adults often rest with their wings folded vertically. These moths have thin bodies and large wings like many butterflies but may be distinguished easily by structural differences in their antennae (e.g. bipectinate).

Monophyly

Monophyly means common descent from a single ancestor.
Biologists have introduced a kind of taxonomy called cladistics. The aim of this is to make biological classification fit what we know about the way organisms evolved.

If there is a group made of a common ancestor, and all its descendants, that group is monophyletic. (Greek: "of one race"). 

A group which contains organisms, without their common ancestor, is called polyphyletic. If a group contains the common ancestor, but leaves out some of its descendants, it is called paraphyletic. All living things on this planet are thought, on the basis of DNA analysis, to be monophyletic, that is, to have one origin, not many. 

Example: all species in the genus "Homo" have come from the same ancestral form in the family Hominidae, and no other descendants are known. Thus the genus "Homo" is monophyletic. 

If, on the other hand, it were discovered that "Homo habilis" had developed from a different ancestor from "Homo sapiens", and this ancestor were not included in the genus, then the genus would be polyphyletic. Since biologists by and large tend to prefer monophyletic groups, in this case, they would likely either split the genus or broaden it to include the additional forms.

Example of polyphyletic group: Sea slugs. 

Sometimes taxonomists are frustrated fitting plant species into a monophyletic group because of polyploidy. There is clear evidence that some polyploid plant species are of multiple origins (the species has arisen more than once). For example "Salsify", the hybrid goat's-beard, ("Tragopogon miscellus") has formed as many as 20 times in eastern Washington.

Also, it can happen that hybrids between two close plant species undergo polyploidy, and the polyploids continue as a new and distinct species. Situations like this are outside the normal rules of descent, and are dealt with by special decisions, guided by the International Commission of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN).

<doc id="63098" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63098" title="Lepidoptera">
Lepidoptera

The order Lepidoptera is the second biggest order in the class Insecta. It includes the butterflies, moths and skippers. Members of the order are called lepidopterans. A person who collects or studies this order is called a Lepidopterist. This order has more than 180,000 species in 128 families and 47 superfamilies. The order Coleoptera (the beetles) is the only order that has more species. The name, Lepidoptera, comes from the Ancient Greek words (scale) and (wing).

Lepidopterans go through "complete metamorphosis". This means that they have a four parts of their life. The first part is the egg. The second part is the caterpillar or larva. The third part is the pupa. The last part is the adult or imago.

The larvae have a tough head and a soft body. They have mouths that are made to chew. Some larvae are covered with hairs, or other body extensions. The larvae have three pairs of small legs on the thorax. These legs are called true legs. There are up to five pairs of bigger legs on the abdomen. These legs are called prolegs. Lepidopteran larvae can be confused with the larvae of sawflies. The difference between Lepidopteran larvae and sawfly larvae is that Lepidopteran larvae have tiny hooks on their prolegs. These hooks are called crochets. Most larvae are herbivores, but a few are carnivores and detritivores.

Adults have two pairs of wings. They are covered by small scales. In some species, the adults have very small wings or no wings at all. This is more common in females. Adults have antennae. Some moths have antennae that look like feathers. These feather-like antennae are larger in males than females. Adults have a mouth part called a proboscis. It is made for nectar from flowers. Some adults do not have mouths and cannot feed. Others have different mouths that are made to pierce and suck blood or fruit juices.

Animals that are active during the day are called diurnal. They hunt or feed during the day and sleep during the night. Nocturnal animals do it the other way round.

Scientists sometimes use the word "crepuscular" to describe nocturnal animals that are not active when it is very dark at night; they are mostly active near dawn, dusk, and sometimes when the moon makes a lot of light.

Skipper (butterfly)

The Skippers are a group of insects in the order Lepidoptera, classified in the superfamily Hesperioidea, which includes only one family, the Hesperiidae.

Skippers differ in several important ways from the remaining butterflies, which are classified in the superfamily Papilionoidea and the neotropical superfamily Hedyloidea. Collectively, these three groups of butterflies share several characteristics especially in the egg, larval and pupal stage (Ackery et al. 1999). However, skippers have the antennae clubs hooked backward like a crochet. The other butterflies have club-like tips to their antennae and hedylids have feathered or pectinate antennae which give them an even more "moth"-like appearance than skippers. Skippers also have generally stockier bodies than the other two groups, with stronger wing muscles. Hesperioidea is very likely the sister group of Papilionoidea, and together with Hedyloidea constitute a natural group or clade.

There are about 3400 species of Skippers. They are usually classified in the following subfamilies:

Note: Some authorities treat the Giant Skippers as a separate family, the Megathymidae, but more modern classifications place them within the subfamily Hesperiinae in the family Hesperiidae.

Many species of skippers look frustratingly alike. For example, some species in the genera "Erynnis", "Hesperia", and "Amblyscirtes" cannot currently be distinguished in the field by experts, the only reliable method of telling them apart involving dissection and examination of the genitalia.

<doc id="63107" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63107" title="Energy conservation">
Energy conservation

Energy conservation means to reduce the quantity of energy that is used for different purposes. This practice may result in increase of financial capital, environmental value, national and personal security, and human comfort.

Individuals and organizations that are direct consumers of energy may want to conserve energy in order to reduce energy costs and promote economic, political and environmental sustainability. Industrial and commercial users may want to increase efficiency and thus maximize profit.

On a larger scale, energy conservation is an important element of energy policy. In general, energy conservation reduces the energy consumption and energy demand per capita. This reduces the rise in energy costs, and can reduce the need for new power plants, and energy imports. The reduced energy demand can provide more flexibility in choosing the most preferred methods of energy production.

By reducing emissions, energy conservation is an important method to prevent climate change. Energy conservation makes it easier to replace non-renewable resources with renewable energy. Energy conservation is often the most economical solution to energy shortages.

The U.S. is currently the largest consumer of energy, although at current levels of growth, it is possible that in the future China could become the leading energy consumer. The U.S. Department of Energy categorizes national energy use in four broad sectors: transportation, residential, commercial, and industrial.

Energy usage in the transportation and residential sectors (about half of U.S. energy consumption) is largely controlled by individual domestic consumers. Commercial and industrial energy usage are controlled by businesses. National energy policy has a significant effect on energy usage across all four sectors.

The transportation sector includes all vehicles used for personal or freight transportation. Of the energy used in this sector, approximately 65% is consumed by gasoline-powered vehicles, primarily personally owned. Diesel-powered transport (trains, merchant ships, heavy trucks, etc.) consumes about 20%, and air traffic consumes most of the remaining 15%.

The oil supply crises of the 1970s spurred the creation, in 1975, of the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program, which required auto manufacturers to meet progressively higher fleet fuel economy targets. The next decade saw dramatic improvements in fuel economy, mostly the result of reductions in vehicle size and weight. These gains eroded somewhat after 1990 due to the growing popularity of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans, which fall under the more lenient "light truck" CAFE standard. 

In addition to the CAFE program, the U.S. government has tried to encourage better vehicle efficiency through tax policy. Since 2002, taxpayers have been eligible for income tax credits for gas/electric hybrid vehicles. A "gas-guzzler" tax has been assessed on manufacturers since 1978 for cars with exceptionally poor fuel economy. While this tax remains in effect, it currently generates very little revenue as overall fuel economy has improved.

Another focus in gasoline conservation is reducing the number of miles driven. An estimated 40% of American automobile use is associated with daily commuting. Many urban areas offer subsidized public transportation to reduce commuting traffic, and encourage carpooling by providing designated high-occupancy vehicle lanes and lower tolls for cars with multiple riders.

In recent years telecommuting has also become a viable alternative to commuting for some jobs, but as of 2003 only 3.5% of workers were telecommuters. Ironically, hundreds of thousands of American and European workers have been replaced by workers in Asia who telecommute from thousands of miles away.

A vehicle's gas mileage normally decreases rapidly at speeds above 55 miles per hour. A car or truck moving at 55 miles an hour can get about 15 percent better fuel economy than the same car going 65 mph. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), as a rule of thumb, each 5 mph you drive over 60 mph is similar to paying an additional $0.21 per gallon for gas (at $3.00 per gallon).

The residential sector refers to all private residences, including single-family homes, apartments, manufactured homes and dormitories. Energy use in this sector varies significantly across the country, due to regional climate differences and different regulation. On average, about half of the energy used in the U.S. homes is expended on space conditioning (i.e. heating and cooling). 

The efficiency of furnaces and air conditioners has increased steadily since the energy crises of the 1970s. The 1987 National Appliance Energy Conservation Act authorized the Department of Energy to set minimum efficiency standards for space conditioning equipment and other appliances each year, based on what is "technologically feasible and economically justified". 

Despite technological improvements, many American lifestyle changes have put higher demands on heating and cooling resources. The average size of homes built in the United States has increased significantly, from 1500 ft² in 1970 to 2300 ft² in 2005. The single-person household has become more common, as has central air conditioning: 23% of households had central air conditioning in 1978, that figure rose to 55% by 2001. 

As a cheaper alternative to the purchase of a new furnace or air conditioner, most public utilities encourage smaller changes the consumer can make to lessen space conditioning usage. Consumers have also been asked to adopt a wider indoor temperature range (e.g. 65 °F in the winter, 80 °F in the summer).


Energy usage in some homes may vary widely from these averages. In most residences no single appliance dominates, and any conservation efforts must be directed to numerous areas in order to achieve substantial energy savings. However, Ground Source Heat Pump systems are the more energy efficient, environmentally clean, and cost-effective space conditioning systems available (Environmental Protection Agency), and can achieve reductions in energy consumptions of up to 70%.

Current best practices in building design and construction result in homes that are much more energy conserving than average new homes. See Passive house, Superinsulation, Self-sufficient homes, Zero energy building, Earthship, Straw-bale construction, MIT Design Advisor, Energy Conservation Code for Indian Commercial Buildings.

Smart ways to construct homes such that minimal resources are used to cooling and heating the house in summer and winter respectively can significantly reduce energy costs!

The commercial sector consists of retail stores, offices (business and government), restaurants, schools and other workplaces. Energy in this sector has the same basic end uses as the residential sector, in slightly different proportions. Space conditioning is again the single biggest consumption area, but it represents only about 30% of the energy use of commercial buildings. Lighting, at 25%, plays a much larger role than it does in the residential sector. Lighting is also generally the most wasteful component of commercial use. A number of case studies indicate that more efficient lighting and elimination of over-illumination can reduce lighting energy by approximately fifty percent in many commercial buildings.

Commercial buildings can greatly increase energy efficiency by thoughtful design, with today's building stock being very poor examples of the potential of systematic (not expensive) energy efficient design (Steffy, 1997). Commercial buildings often have professional management, allowing centralized control and coordination of energy conservation efforts. 

Solar heat loading through standard window designs usually leads to high demand for air conditioning in summer months. An example of building design overcoming this excessive heat loading is the Dakin Building in Brisbane, California, where fenestration was designed to achieve an angle with respect to sun incidence to allow maximum reflection of solar heat; this design also assisted in reducing interior over-illumination to enhance worker efficiency and comfort.

The industrial sector represents all production and processing of goods, including manufacturing, construction, farming, water management and mining. Increasing costs have forced energy-intensive industries to make substantial efficiency improvements in the past 30 years. For example, the energy used to produce steel and paper products has been cut 40% in that time frame, while petroleum/aluminum refining and cement production have reduced their usage by about 25%. These reductions are largely the result of recycling waste material and the use of cogeneration equipment for electricity and heating.

The energy required for delivery and treatment of fresh water often constitutes a significant percentage of a region's electricity and natural gas usage (an estimated 20% of California's total energy use is water-related.) In light of this, some local governments have worked toward a more integrated approach to energy and water conservation efforts. 

Unlike the other sectors, total energy use in the industrial sector has declined in the last decade. While this is partly due to conservation efforts, it's also a reflection of the growing trend for U.S. companies to move manufacturing operations offshore.

The usage of telecommuting by major corporations is a significant opportunity to conserve energy, as many Americans now work in service jobs that enable them to work from home instead of commuting to work each day.

Cogeneration

Cogeneration (also combined heat and power, CHP) is the use of a heat engine or a power station to make both electricity and useful heat at the same time.

Conventional power plants emit the heat created as a byproduct of electricity generation into the environment through cooling towers, as flue gas, or by other means. Combined heat and power captures the byproduct heat for domestic or industrial heating purposes, either very close to the plant, or - especially in Scandinavia and eastern Europe - for distribution through pipes to heat local housing. 

Byproduct heat at moderate temperatures (100 to 180°C) can also be used in absorption chillers for cooling. A plant producing electricity, heat and cold is sometimes called regeneration or more generally: polygene ration plant. 

Cogeneration is a thermodynamically efficient use of fuel. In separate production of electricity some energy is lost as waste heat, but in cogeneration this energy performs useful work (see energy).

Thermal power plants (including those that use fissile elements or burn coal, petroleum, or natural gas), and heat engines in general, do not convert all of their available energy into electricity. In most heat engines, a bit more than half is wasted as excess heat (see: Second law of thermodynamics). By capturing the excess heat, CHP uses heat that would be wasted in a conventional power plant, potentially reaching an efficiency of up to 70%, compared with at most 40% for the conventional plants. This means that less fuel needs to be consumed to produce the same amount of useful energy. Also, less pollution is produced for a given economic benefit.

An exact match between the heat and electricity needs rarely exists. A CHP plant can either meet the need for heat ("heat driven operation") or be run as a power plant with some use of its waste heat.

CHP is most efficient when the heat can be used on site or very close to it. Overall efficiency is reduced when the heat must be transported over longer distances. This requires heavily insulated pipes, which are expensive and inefficient; whereas electricity can be transmitted along a comparatively simple wire, and over much longer distances for the same energy loss.

A car motor becomes a CHP plant in winter, when the reject heat is useful for warming the interior of the vehicle. This example scores the point that deployment of CHP depends on heat uses in the neighbourhood of the heat engine.

Cogeneration plants are commonly found in district heating systems of big towns, hospitals, prisons, oil refineries, paper mills, wastewater treatment plants, thermal enhanced oil recovery wells and industrial plants with large heating needs.

Dew point

The dew point is the temperature where water vapour condenses into liquid water.

All air holds different amounts of water vapour. The dew point shows the amount of moisture in the air. The higher the dew point is, the higher the level of moisture in the air at a given temperature. The dew point of humid air will be higher than the dew point of dry air.

Condensation of water vapour starts when the temperature of air is lowered to its dew point and beyond. The dew point, like other measures of humidity, can be found from measurement taken by a hygrometer.

Gas compressor

A gas compressor is a mechanical device that increases the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume. Compression of a gas naturally increases its temperature. 

Compressors are similar to pumps: both increase the pressure on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe. As gases are compressible, the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas. Liquids are relatively incompressible, so the main action of a pump is to transport liquids.

There are many different types of gas compressors. The two primary categories are:

The more important types in each of the four sub-categories are discussed below.

Centrifugal compressors use a vaned rotating disk or impeller in a shaped housing to force the gas to the rim of the impeller, increasing the velocity of the gas. A diffuser (divergent duct) section converts the velocity energy to pressure energy. They are primarily used for continuous, stationary service in industries such as oil refineries, chemical and petrochemical plants and natural gas processing plants. Their application can be from 100 hp (75 kW) to thousands of horsepower. With multiple staging, they can achieve extremely high output pressures greater than 10,000 psi (69 MPa). 

Many large snow-making operations (like ski resorts) use this type of compressor. They are also used in internal combustion engines as superchargers and turbochargers. Centrifugal compressors are used in small gas turbine engines or as the final compression stage of medium sized gas turbines.

Diagonal or mixed-flow compressors are similar to centrifugal compressors, but have a radial and axial velocity component at the exit from the rotor. The diffuser is often used to turn diagonal flow to the axial direction. The diagonal compressor has a lower diameter diffuser than the equivalent centrifugal compressor.

Axial-flow compressors use a series of fan-like rotating rotor blades to progressively compress the gasflow. Stationary stator vanes, located downstream of each rotor, redirect the flow onto the next set of rotor blades. The area of the gas passage diminishes through the compressor to maintain a roughly constant axial Mach number. Axial-flow compressors are normally used in high flow applications, such as medium to large gas turbine engines. They are almost always multi-staged. Beyond about 4:1 design pressure ratio, variable geometry is often used to improve operation.

Reciprocating compressors use pistons driven by a crankshaft. They can be either stationary or portable, can be single or multi-staged, and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines. Small reciprocating compressors from 5 to 30 horsepower (hp) are commonly seen in automotive applications and are typically for intermittent duty. Larger reciprocating compressors up to 1000 hp are still commonly found in large industrial applications, but their numbers are declining as they are replaced by various other types of compressors. Discharge pressures can range from low pressure to very high pressure (>5000 psi or 35 MPa). In certain applications, such as air compression, multi-stage double-acting compressors are said to be the most efficient compressors available, and are typically larger, noisier, and more costly than comparable rotary units.

Rotary screw compressors use two meshed rotating positive-displacement helical screws to force the gas into a smaller space. These are usually used for continuous operation in commercial and industrial applications and may be either stationary or portable. Their application can be from 3 hp (2.24 kW) to over 500 hp (375 kW) and from low pressure to very high pressure (>1200 psi or 8.3 MPa). They are commonly seen with roadside repair crews powering air-tools. This type is also used for many automobile engine superchargers because it is easily matched to the induction capacity of a piston engine.

A scroll compressor, also known as scroll pump and scroll vacuum pump, uses two interleaved spiral-like vanes to pump or compress fluids such as liquids and gases. The vane geometry may be involute, archimedean spiral, or hybrid curves. They operate more smoothly, quietly, and reliably than other types of compressors.

Often, one of the scrolls is fixed, while the other orbits eccentrically without rotating, thereby trapping and pumping or compressing pockets of fluid between the scrolls.

A diaphragm compressor (also known as a membrane compressor) is a variant of the conventional reciprocating compressor. The compression of gas occurs by the movement of a flexible membrane, instead of an intake element. The back and forth movement of the membrane is driven by a rod and a crankshaft mechanism. Only the membrane and the compressor box come in touch with the gas being compressed.

Diaphragm compressors are used for hydrogen and compressed natural gas (CNG) as well as in a number of other applications.

Air compressors sold to and used by the general public are often attached on top of a tank for holding the pressurized air. Oil-lubricated and oil-free compressors are available. Oil-free compressors are desirable because without a properly designed separator, oil can make its way into the air stream. For some purposes, for example as a diving air compressor, even a little oil in the air stream may be unacceptable.

Charles's law says "when a gas is compressed, temperature is raised". There are three possible relationships between temperature and pressure in a volume of gas undergoing compression:

Since compression generates heat, the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal. The inter-stage coolers cause condensation meaning water separators with drain valves are present. The compressor flywheel may drive a cooling fan.

For instance in a typical diving compressor, the air is compressed in three stages. If each stage has a compression ratio of 7 to 1, the compressor can output 343 times atmospheric pressure (7 x 7 x 7 = 343 Atmospheres).

Gas compressors are used in various applications where either higher pressures or lower volumes of gas are needed:

Cash is a form of liquid currency, such as banknotes or coins. There is usually different sorts in every country.
In bookkeeping and finance, "cash" can also refer to checks, money orders, cashier's checks, bank drafts, or traveler's checks. In all these forms, the term indicates the most liquid form of assets, which have a fixed value and can be easily converted to currency: "ready money". For example, wages or salaries paid as "cash" (as opposed to, e.g., stock options) would in most countries normally be paid with checks or direct bank deposits, which are trivially convertible to currency.

Heat engine

A heat engine is a device that converts heat into mechanical motion that can be used to do work. Many kinds of real heat engines have been invented like the internal combustion engine that drives cars and the steam engine that once powered ships and trains. Scientists called thermodynamists study heat engines and how they work. 

In engineering and thermodynamics, a heat engine converts heat energy to mechanical work by using the temperature difference between a hot "source" and a cold "sink". Heat is transferred from the source, through the "working body" of the engine, to the "sink", and in this process some of the heat changes into work by using the qualities of the gas or liquid inside the engine. 

There are many kinds of Heat engines. Each has a thermodynamic cycle. Heat engines are often named after the thermodynamic cycle they use , like the Carnot cycle. They often pick up everyday names, such as gasoline/petrol, turbine, or steam engines. 

Some heat engines may generate heat inside the engine itself. Others may absorb heat from an external source. Heat engines can be open to the air or sealed and closed off to the outside (This is called an Open or Closed cycle). 
When scientists study heat engines they come up with ideas for engines that cannot actually be built . These are called ideal engines or cycles. 

Real heat engines are often confused with the ideal engines or cycles they attempt to mimic. 

Typically when describing the physical device the term 'engine' is used. When describing the ideal the term 'cycle' is used. 

One could say that the thermodynamic cycle is an ideal case of the mechanical engine. One could equally say that the model does not quite perfectly match the mechanical engine. However, much benefit is gained from the simplified models, and ideal cases they may represent.

In general terms, the larger the difference in temperature between the hot source and the cold sink, the more efficient the cycle or engine. On Earth, the cold side of any heat engine is limited to the air temperature of the place where the engine is. 

Most efforts to improve the efficiency of heat engines goes into increasing the temperature of the heat source, but at very high temperatures the metal of the engine begins to go soft.

The efficiency of various heat engines proposed or used today ranges from 3 percent (97 percent waste heat) for the OTEC ocean power proposal through 25 percent for most automotive engines, to 45 percent for a supercritical coal plant, to about 60 percent for a steam-cooled combined cycle gas turbine. All of these processes gain their efficiency (or lack thereof) due to the temperature drop across them. 

The least efficient , OTEC, uses the temperature difference of ocean water on the surface and ocean water from the depths, a small difference of perhaps 25 degrees Celsius, and so the efficiency must be low. 

The most efficient , the combined cycle gas turbine burns natural-gas to heat air to nearly 1530 degrees Celsius, a large temperature difference of 1500 degrees Celsius, and so the efficiency can be very large when the steam-cooling cycle is added. 

Examples of everyday heat engines include: the steam engine, the diesel engine, and the gasoline (petrol) engine in an automobile. 

The stirling engine is less common but is found in small models which can run off the heat of a hand.
A common toy that is also a heat engine is the drinking bird.
All of these familiar heat engines are powered by the expansion of heated gases. 

A bimetalic strip is a device that converts temperature into mechanical movement and is used in thermostats to control temperature. It is a heat engine that does not use a liquid or gas.

Thermodynamic cycle

A thermodynamic cycle is a series of thermodynamic processes which returns a system to its initial state. Properties depend only on the thermodynamic state and thus do not change over a cycle. Variables such as heat and work are not zero over a cycle, but rather depend on the process. The first law of thermodynamics dictates that the net heat input is equal to the net work output over any cycle. The repeating nature of the process path allows for continuous operation, making the cycle an important concept in thermodynamics. 
If the cyclic process moves clockwise around the loop, then it represents a heat engine, and W will be positive. If it moves counterclockwise then it represents a heat pump, and W will be negative.

Two primary classes of thermodynamic cycles are power cycles and heat pump cycles. Power cycles are cycles which convert some heat input into a mechanical work output, while heat pump cycles transfer heat from low to high temperatures using mechanical work input. 

Thermodynamic power cycles are the basis for the operation of heat engines, which supply most of the world's electric power and run almost all motor vehicles. Power cycles can be divided according to the type of heat engine they seek to model. The most common cycles that model internal combustion engines are the Otto cycle, which models gasoline engines and the Diesel cycle, which models diesel engines. Cycles that model external combustion engines include the Brayton cycle, which models gas turbines, and the Rankine cycle, which models steam turbines.

Thermodynamic system

In thermodynamics, a thermodynamic system, originally called a "working substance", is defined as that part of the universe that is under consideration. A real or imaginary boundary separates the system from the rest of the universe, which is referred to as the environment or surroundings (sometimes called a reservoir.) A useful classification of thermodynamic systems is based on the nature of the boundary and the quantities flowing through it, such as matter, energy, work, heat, and entropy. A system can be anything, for example a cylinder, a solution in a test tube, a living organism, or a planet, etc.

Piston

In general, a piston is a lubricated sliding shaft that fits tightly inside the opening of a cylinder. Its purpose is to change the volume enclosed by the cylinder, to exert a force on a fluid inside the cylinder, to cover and uncover ports, or some combination of these. A rubber seal is sometimes used to keep the lubricate within the shaft. Due to the constant motion of the machine this seal wears quickly and should be replaced with every servicing. If the seal should break during usage there can be disastrous long lasting consequences for the machine. 

There are two ways that a piston engine can transform combustion into motive power. These are two-stroke and four-stroke.

A single cylinder two-stroke engine produces power every crankshaft revolution, while a single cylinder four-stroke engine produces power once every two revolutions. Older designs of small two-stroke engines produced more pollution than four stroke engines. However, modern two-stroke designs, like the Vespa ET2 Injection utilise fuel-injection and are as clean as four-strokes. Large diesel two-stroke engines, as used in ships and locomotives, have always used fuel injection and produce low emissions. One of the biggest internal combustion engines in the world, the Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C is a two-stroke; it is bigger than most two-story houses, has pistons nearly 1 metre in diameter and is one of the most efficient mobile engines in existence. In theory, a four stroke engine has to be larger than a two stroke engine to produce an equivalent amount of power. Two stroke engines are becoming less common in developed countries these days, mainly due to manufacturer reluctance to invest in reducing two-stroke emissions. Traditionally, two stroke engines were reputed to need more maintenance. Even though the simplest two stroke engines have fewer moving parts, they could wear out faster than four stroke engines. However fuel-injected two-strokes achieve better engine lubrication, and cooling and reliability should improve considerably.

A steam engine is another type of piston engine. In most steam engines, the pistons are "double acting": steam is alternately admitted to either end of the cylinder, so that every piston stroke produces power.

Banknote

A banknote (more commonly known as a bill in the United States and Canada) is a paper by which a bank promises to pay to the bearer on demand. Along with coins, banknotes make up the cash forms of all modern money. 
Coins are generally used for lower valued monetary units, and banknotes for higher values.

Originally, the value of money was determined by the value of the material the money was made of, such as silver or gold. However, carrying around a lot of precious metal was cumbersome and often dangerous. As an alternative, banknotes would be issued. In financial terms, a note is a promise to pay someone money. Banknotes were originally a promise to pay the bearer an amount of precious metal stored in a vault somewhere. In this way the stored value (usually in gold or silver coins) backing the banknote could transfer ownership in exchange for goods or services.

In Europe the first paper money consisted of paper 'coins' issued in Protestant Leyden (today, Leiden) in the Netherlands during the Spanish siege of 1574. Over 5000 of the estimated 14,000 residents of Leyden died, mostly due to starvation. Even leather (often used to create emergency currency) was boiled and used to feed the people. So to create currency, the residents took covers and paper from hymnals and church missives and created paper planchets, which were struck using the same dies that were previously used to mint coins. 
The first proper European banknotes were issued by Stockholms Banco, a predecessor of the Bank of Sweden, in 1660, although the bank ran out of coins to redeem its notes in 1664 and ceased operating in that year.

Emergency paper money hand-written on playing cards was used in French Canada from 1685.

In the early 1690s, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was the first of the colonies to issue the permanently circulating banknotes. The use of fixed denominations and printed banknotes came into use in the 18th century. 

In the United States, public acceptance of banknotes in replacement of precious metals was hastened in part by Executive Order 6102. This order carried the threat of a maximum $10,000 fine and a maximum of ten years in prison for anyone who kept more than $100 of gold in preference to bank notes. Similar measures were taken worldwide, with similar results.

Common cold

A common cold (usually known as just a cold) is a viral infectious disease. It affects the breathing, like the nose and the throat. A person who has a cold might sneeze, cough, or have a running nose. Those things are called "symptoms". There is currently no way to cure a common cold. There are drugs that can stop the symptoms, though. It is one of the most common diseases today.

A good way to not get the disease is to wash hands often, with soap. Antibacterial soaps have no effect on the virus, but the action of washing (scrubbing) will scrub the viruses away.

The virus can affect breathing and taste by swelling the blood vessels in your nose. If the nose is blocked, tasting food (drinks) can become hard.
