Wikipedia:Call a spade a spade

To call a spade a spade is to describe something clearly and directly. Rather than using confusing language, just "tell it like it is."

Users sometimes tell people to read and use our policies, like our and our , not to protect themselves from personal attacks, but to protect their edits from review.

Although editors who always edit badly are bad editors and editors who always vandalize are vandals, we all need to be to each other. But being civil should not be confused with being friendly or courteous, let alone charitable.

It's OK to let others know when you think they're acting badly. Being polite will get them to listen more.

The "duck test" – "if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck" – means you can work something out by looking at what it does without needing definite proof.

A good example is when different editors make very similar bad edits. Sometimes this will cause a . If it is really obvious that the edits are being made by the same person, then the "duck test" can be used. In other words, "the edits look the same, the edits are made to the same pages and the edits are made close together, it's probably ".

Michelle Richardson

Michelle Richardson is a fictional character on the British television series "Skins". She is played by April Pearson.

Michelle appears to only be interested in her boyfriend Tony Stonem, and "looking shaggable" (in other words being attractive) something she describes an important part of who she is. Although Michelle appears confident, especially of her appearance, she can be seen worried in the first series that Tony is cheating on her, especially with posh schoolgirl Abigail Stock. On Michelle's "about me" page located on the official Skins website, Michelle describes Jal Fazer as her best friend, saying that she and Jal have been in the same class since they were four, and that Jal still lets her copy from her homework. Even though Michelle doesn't seem to be interested in her schoolwork, she receives 2 A's and 1 B on her A Levels, and is accepted into the University of York after she finishes school at "Roundview College". She also shows talent at speaking languages. Including French and Spanish, in the series one episode "Tony" Michelle appears to also understand Italian when spoken near her.

Although Michelle can be self centered -- where she mainly focuses on her boyfriend Tony -- she can be very helpful and caring too, such as when she solves her mother's relationship problems or befriends Sketch in series two. She also shows concern for Effy Stonem, and for her friendship with Jal in the first series episode "Maxxie and Anwar", where she feels she has not been a very good friend to her.

Michelle likes Stevie Nicks, Peaches, and Eminem, but she doesn't like Keane or James Blunt. Her favourite movies are Mean Girls, Emperor's New Groove, and Last Seduction, and her favourite television shows are One Tree Hill, Scrubs, and Extreme Makeover.

Michelle is aware that Sid Jenkins, her boyfriend Tony's best friend, is in love with her, and tries to help by setting Sid up with her friend Cassie Ainsworth. Although loyal to him, Michelle worries that Tony is cheating on her, and breaks up with Tony after he kisses and fondles Abigail Stock at a choir performance. Sid tries to get with Michelle, but Tony takes her back before anything happens. After catching Tony trying to have sex with Maxxie during their class trip to Russia, Michelle breaks up with Tony again, except this time she will not take him back. She tries to have sex with Sid during this time, but Sid has fallen in love with Cassie, and reminds Michelle that she really loves Tony and is just looking for comfort. When Josh Stock, Abigail Stock's brother, asks Michelle out she agrees, and the two have a good time together for a short time. But their relationship is ruined by Tony. At Anwar's birthday party Tony calls Michelle on her phone and tells her that he loves her, bringing Michelle to tears, but Tony is hit by a bus.

In the second series Michelle avoids Tony, who is recovering from the accident and has a bad memory. Michell has been coping with sex, drugs, and partying. She returns to her normal self and tries to get back with Tony, but Tony is completely different now, and cannot have sex. Michelle invites Tony on her birthday camping trip, but Tony says no, and on the camping trip Michelle has sex with Sid and the two become involved. They try to keep their relationship secret, but Sid's girlfriend Cassie is angry, and tells everybody. Tony pretends not to care, but eventually tries to get Michelle back. Realizing they aren't in love with each other, Michelle and Sid end their relationship, and Michelle and Tony try to make a relationship work. Everything goes well, but they are accepted into different universities after graduation, and it is unknown whether they stay together or not.

Nomination by : Hello, I am nominating , a helpful and dedicated contributer to Simple English Wikipedia for adminship. I believe Shappy has improved quite a bit since his last RfA, and he has expanded his work in several areas, just enough for another chance at RfA. 

Shappy has been participating in adminly areas. This includes the over 50 "accurate" requests he has done, his help in reverting , the reports he has done (I admit not many, but I assume this isn't his main area), comments at places such as and (which seems like he works well with others as he is civil), and more. He has over 1500 quality edits. I consider this a high total already, as users have passed RfAs with lower edits. Out of these edits, 31% are in the mainspace (including a , Avril Lavigne), and 24% are in the projectspace. He started editing actively in July 2008, but has mentioned he took several short breaks to stay cool, which I think is fine... you wouldn't want to over work yourself, and we all know there's a thing called "real life" that should always be first in our lives. Anyway, these qualities is what I look for as in an administrator, and I believe Shappy is right for the job. 

We could always use the extra help, and I think Shappy can fill in for that. We need all the help we can get. I always thought the more administrators there are, the better. I also believe it doesn't matter how "much" an admin does, but if that person is doing the job "right". Shappy has shown he knows what he is doing, and I believe he would know what to do if given the admin tools. Each and every new member to the admin team is another plus for our community. Or in other words, each new seed in the soil is another flower in our forest. And yes, it takes time for a seed to grow, and I believe Shappy has grown into a flower (his name sure does sounds like one anyway!). So after all I have said, I proudly nominate Shappy for adminship. 

Thank you. — () 00:43, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

June McCarroll

June Hill Robertson McCarroll (June 30 1867—March 30 1954) was a nurse (later a physician) with the Southern Pacific Railroad in the early twentieth century. She has been credited by Caltrans with the idea of using a painted line to separate lanes of traffic on a highway. This is now in use all over the world.

McCarroll was born and raised in the Adirondacks. She attended a medical college in Chicago. She moved to Southern California in 1904 with her first husband, John Robertson. They had hoped that the desert climate would help him with his tuberculosis, but Robertson died in 1914. She later married Frank McCarroll, the local station manager for the Southern Pacific Railroad. From 1907 to 1916, she was the only physician regularly practicing in the vast desert between the Salton Sea and Palm Springs. She was also the only physician serving the area's five Indian reservations for the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

In the fall of 1917, McCarroll was driving on the road leading to her office near Indio, California on a stretch of highway that would later become part of U.S. Route 99. Today, that part of the highway is part of Indio Boulevard. She was literally run off the road by a truck, as she recalled many years later: 

McCarroll soon told her idea to the local chamber of commerce and the Riverside County Board of Supervisors, but no one listened. Finally, she took it upon herself to hand-paint a white stripe down the middle of the road. This would later help drivers since they could now easily see the actual width of the lane and keep accidents like Nurse McCarroll's from happening again. Through the Indio Women's Club and many similar women's groups, Nurse McCarroll launched a statewide letter writing campaign to tell of her proposal. In November 1924, the idea was adopted by the California Highway Commission and 3,500 miles of lines were painted at a cost of $163,000. It would not be long before the idea was adopted worldwide.

A memorial plaque to Dr. McCarroll may be found at the intersection of Indio Boulevard and Flower Street in Indio, California. On April 24, 2002, to honor her contribution to road safety, the State of California named the stretch of Interstate 10 near Indio east of the Indio Boulevard/Jefferson Street exit as "The Doctor June McCarroll Memorial Freeway." To find the plaque with a GPS system, the coordinates are 33º43.260 N, 116º13.040 W.

Sopwith Camel

The Sopwith Camel was a British World War I fighter biplane, it was famous for flying very well.

The Sopwith Camel entered service in June 1917.

Unlike other biplanes, the Camel was unpleasant to fly. The Camel could manoeuvre well because of the placement of the engine, pilot, guns, and fuel tank, but controlling the engine torque made flying it difficult and dangerous.

The Camel soon had a bad reputation with pilots. The engine was sensitive to fuel mixture control, and wrong settings caused the engine to cut out during takeoff. Many crashed due to mishandling on takeoff when a full fuel tank affected the center of gravity. As well as this, the Camel was also known for its bad spinning characteristics, where any stall resulted in an uncontrollable spin.

The Camel had better guns and better performance compared to other biplanes. Its controls were light and sensitive. The Camel was one of the best-remembered Allied aircraft of the First World War. 
The Camel was credited with shooting down 1,294 enemy aircraft, more than any other Allied fighter.

By 1918 better aircraft had been invented, faster and with better high altitude performance. The camel soon became a ground-attack and infantry support aircraft. When fighting Germans in March 1918, flights of Camels stopped the advancing German Army. Because of this the Camel remained in service until the (ceasefire).

<doc id="183453" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183453" title="Celtic Christianity">
Celtic Christianity

Celtic Christianity refers to the Early Medieval Christian practice that evolved in Ireland after the introduction of Christianity in the fourth millennium. Having taken its cultural foundation from the egalitarian, gender inclusive, nature based culture of the Celts, Celtic Christianity was very different in its basic practice from Roman Christianity which became based in the hierarchical, patriarchal culture of Rome following Constantine's absorption of Christianity into accepted society of Imperial Rome. While few Christians call themselves Celtic Christians today, many of the Celtic values still influence much of the Christian world.

Roman Christianity was late arriving in Ireland because the Roman armies never invaded the island. Consequently, Roman culture, and its brand of Roman Christianity had little influence on early Irish Christianity. Because the educated class of the Celts, the Druids, had a long history of educational excellence and philosophic curiosity, they welcomed the new religion into Ireland as they did all new information. (The ancient Greeks did student exchanges with the Druids whom they considered the other great philosophers in Europe. Perhaps the most famous Greek scholar to study under the Druids was Pythagoras.)Ireland is the one country that had no martyrs when Christianity came into its territory, prompting the Irish Christians of later years, so as not to be outdone, to develop the "White Martyrdom" of monks who lived austere lives as "living martyrs." Christian worship had reached Ireland around 400 AD. Ireland at this time was still very much a Celtic nation, what the generalization by the Roman Church called pagan. Contrary to common myth, the Irish did not abandon their Celtic culture in favor of Christianity, but rather wove Christianity into their culture, as they did with so many other ideas they encountered through the millennia. The Celtic cross reflects this mingling of the two. Celtic culture, unlike the very linear philosophy of Rome and Greece, was built upon a very cyclically minded philosophy, patterning itself after the seasonal cycles and life cycles they observed in their beloved natural world. The Celtic cross includes the cross to represent Christianity and the Circle to represent the Celtic world view.

Roman Christianity, like Roman culture, was a city based culture. All of the letters of Saint Paul that made it into the official Roman cannon of the New Testament were written to new churches in various Roman cities. (The Latin word for Celt, by the way, was Galli; Paul's letter to the Galatians was written to a Celtic settlement, uncharacteristically urban, in what is now Turkey.) For most of its early history, the Roman church paid little attention to the country dwellers they called the "Paganus," which is equivalent to the contemporary "redneck" or "country bumpkin." Consequently, it was not the Roman missionaries who Christianized the vast majority of the European land mass, it was the monks from Ireland who were comfortable with the nature loving ways of the Paganus who traveled to mainland Europe and taught the country folk Celtic Christianity. Despite Rome's later philosophic battles against it, like those at the Synod of Whitby in 664 AD, Celtic Christianity remained the dominant form of Christianity in terms of numbers of adherents for the first thousand years of the Christian era. Most modern Christians do not know this because once Rome either converted, suppressed, or killed the adherents of what they saw as a heresy, they removed all reference to Celtic Christianity's legacy from the libraries of Europe...except the Irish libraries, material being translated only since the Irish Revolution in the early Twentieth Century.

Legend says that Cetlic Christianity in Britain was founded by St. Joseph of Arimathea; legend also says that King Arthur is buried in his ruined abbey. According to legend, Joseph was a tin merchant who was often coming and going to the tin mines of Roman Britain. Legend continues to say that he may have taken his nephew, Jesus, with him on some of these trips. Later Joseph of Aramathea becomes first keeper of the Holy Grail. Perhaps the best known myth about Celtic Christianity is that Saint Patrick brought Christianity to Ireland. Christianity was already established in Ireland by the time Patrick began his ministry. What he brought to Ireland was Roman Christianity, not Christianity itself.

Power over Ethernet

Power over Ethernet is a technology that allows to supply electricity over standard Ethernet cables. This is useful in many ways, as it allows to only have one cable to both provide the computer network and electricity to a device. It can be used for powering IP telephones, wireless LAN access points, network cameras, remote network switches, embedded computers, and other appliances. In many of these cases it is often inconvenient, expensive or infeasible to supply power separately. 

The technology is comparable to POTS telephones. These also receive power and data through the same cable. Power over ethernet doesn't require changing the existing Ethernet cabling infrastructure.

There are several general terms used to describe this feature. The terms power over Ethernet (PoE), power over LAN (PoL), and inline power are synonymous terms used to describe the powering of attached devices via Ethernet ports.

There are several PoE implementations, including ad-hoc techniques, but using the IEEE standard for supplying power over Ethernet is strongly recommended.

Portuguese Empire

The Portuguese Empire (Portuguese: "Império Português") was one of the first global empires in history. It spread from South America to Africa, India and South East Asia. It began with the Portuguese exploration of the world during the 15th century and it lasted longer than all the other modern European empires. It lasted almost five centuries. This is longer than the Spanish, British, and French Empires.

The rise of Soviet influence in the working class, and the cost of the Portuguese Colonial War (1961–1974), led to its failure in 1974. The National Salvation Junta (Junta de Salvação Nacional) - was to end the wars and push Portuguese from its African colonies. These events made thousands of Portuguese refuges from Portugal's African territories. 

Civil wars soon broke out. The communist governments fighting against insurgent groups. After years of fighting, Portgual gave Macau to China in 1999.

The seven former colonies of Portugal have Portuguese as their official language. They are members of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries with Portugal. Today Portuguese is one of the world's major languages. It is the language of about half of South America.

Battle of the Teutoburg Forest

The Battle of the Teutoburg Forest was a military battle that took place in the year 9 AD. In the battle, an alliance of Germanic tribes won a major victory over three Roman legions. The Germanic tribes were led by Arminius; the Roman legions by Publius Quinctilius Varus.

This was more than a victory, it was the complete destruction of three Roman legions and all their commanders; the few men who survived were made slaves. It was the greatest disaster in Roman military history. Apart from occasional raids and campaigns, the Romans never again held the Germanic land across the Rhine. 

The battle began a seven-year war which ended with the Rhine as the boundary of the Roman Empire for the next four hundred years, until the decline of the Western Roman Empire.

The Roman commander, Varus, was about the fourth most important man in Rome. He was known and feared because of his ruthless actions and his crucifixion of defeated enemies. It is certain this was known to the Germans, and may have helped the tribes come together to resist him.

The German commander was Arminius, who had been given a Roman military education. He had spent his youth in Rome as a hostage. Therefore he knew Roman military methods: this knowledge was to be crucial.

Later, Arminius returned to Germania with Varus, and became his trusted advisor. In secret, he forged an alliance of Germanic tribes that had traditionally been enemies. He was helped to do this by the anger over Varus' insolence and cruelty to the people he defeated.

"...Stratagem was, therefore, indispensable; and it was necessary to blind Varus to their schemes until a favorable opportunity should arrive for striking a decisive blow..." British historian Edward Shepherd Creasy (1812–1878) 

While Varus was on his way from his summer camp, west of the Weser river, to the winter headquarters near the Rhine, he heard reports of a local rebellion. This was faked by Arminius. 

"...This was represented to Varus as an occasion which required his prompt attendance at the spot; but he was kept in studied ignorance of its being part of a concerted national rising; and he still looked on Arminius as his submissive vassal..." Edward Shepherd Creasy

Recent archaeological finds place the battle at Kalkriese Hill in Osnabrück County, Lower Saxony. The Romans must at this time have been marching northwestward from the area that is now the city of Detmold, passing east of Osnabrück; they must then have camped in this area before being attacked.

Varus's forces included three legions, six cohorts of auxiliary troops (non-citizens or allied troops) and three squadrons of cavalry. Many of them had little combat experience with Germanic fighters under local conditions. 

The Roman forces were not marching in combat formation, and there were also large numbers of camp-followers. As they entered the forest they found the track narrow and muddy; according to Dio Cassius a violent storm had also arisen. He also writes that Varus neglected to send out advance reconnaissance parties.

The line of march was dangerously stretched out – estimates are that it was more than 15 km (9 miles), and was perhaps as long as 20 km (12 miles). It was then suddenly attacked by Germanic warriors who were carrying some light swords, large lances and spears that came with short and narrow blades, so sharp and warrior friendly that they could be used as required. The Germanic warriors surrounded the entire Roman army and rained down javelins on the intruders.

The Romans were able to set up a fortified night camp, and the next morning broke out into open country, near the modern town of Ostercappeln. The break-out cost them heavy losses, as did a further attempt to escape by marching through another forest area, with heavy rains continuing. The rain stopped them from using their bows because sinew strings become slack when wet, and left them virtually defenseless as their shields also became waterlogged.

The Romans then began a night march to escape, but marched into another trap that Arminius had set, at the foot of a kill near Osnabrück. There, the sandy, open strip on which the Romans could march easily narrowed at the bottom of the hill. There was a gap of only about 100 m between the woods and the swampland at the edge of the Great Bog. The road was blocked by a trench, and, towards the forest, an earthen wall had been built along the roadside. This let the tribesmen to attack the Romans from cover. 

The Romans made a desperate attempt to storm the wall, but failed. The Germanic warriors then stormed the field and slaughtered the Romans; Varus committed suicide. 

Around 15,000–20,000 Roman soldiers must have died; not only Varus, but also many of his officers are said to have taken their own lives by falling on their swords in the approved manner. Tacitus wrote that many officers were sacrificed by the Germans as part of their indigenous religious ceremonies, cooked in pots and their bones used for rituals. However, others were ransomed, and some of the common soldiers were enslaved. 

The victory over the legions was followed by a clean sweep of all Roman forts, garrisons and cities – of which there were at least two – east of the Rhine. The remaining two Roman legions in Germany were stationed in a fort at Mainz, and commanded by Varus' nephew. They were content to try to hold the Rhine.

Though we can never know why Varus made these mistakes, his reputation for arrogance and over-confidence suggests he under-estimated the Germans. But all Rome's previous experience, from Caesar onwards, had shown the Germanic tribes as strong in war.

Upon hearing of the defeat, the Emperor Augustus, according to the Roman historian Suetonius in his work "De vita Caesarum" (On the life of the Caesars), was so shaken by the news that he stood butting his head against the wall of his palace, repeatedly shouting:
„""“ ('Quintilius Varus, give me back my legions!') 

The three legion numbers were never used again by the Romans after this defeat, unlike other legions that were restructured – a case unique in Roman history.

The battle ended the period of triumphant Roman expansion that had followed the end of the Civil Wars 40 years earlier. Augustus' stepson Tiberius took effective control, and prepared for the continuation of the war. Three legions were sent to the Rhine to replace the lost legions.

Though their shock at the slaughter was great, the Romans immediately began a slow, systematic process of preparing to reconquer the country. In 14 AD, just after Augustus' death, and the accession of his heir and stepson Tiberius, a huge raid was led by the new emperor's nephew Germanicus. 

On a starry night he massacred the Marsi and ravaged their villages with fire and sword. That night the Germans had celebrated; drunk and asleep, they were surprised by Germanicus. The temple of their deity was destroyed. 

Several other tribes were roused by this slaughter and ambushed Germanicus on the way to his winter-quarters, but were defeated with heavy losses.

The next year was marked by two major campaigns and several smaller battles with a large army estimated at 55,000–70,000 men, backed by naval forces. In spring 15 AD, the legate Caecina Severus invaded the Marsi a second time with 25,000–30,000 men, causing great havoc. 

Meanwhile, Germanicus' troops had built a fort on Mount Taunus from where he marched with 30 to 35,000 men against the Chatti (probably a region of villages) and slaughtered children, women and the elderly. The able-bodied men fled across a river and hid themselves in the forests. After this blow Germanicus marched on Mattium and burned the city down.

In summer 15 AD, the army visited the site of the first battle. According to Tacitus, they found heaps of bones, and skulls nailed to trees, which they buried, "...looking on all as kinsfolk and of their own blood...". Burial pits with remains fitting this description have been found at Kalkriese Hill.

Under Germanicus, the Romans marched another army, along with allied Germanic soldiers, into Germania again in 16 AD. He was able to fight his way across the Weser near modern Minden, suffering some losses. He forced Arminius' army to stand in open battle at the Weser River. Germanicus's legions inflicted huge casualties on the Germanic armies while sustaining only minor losses. 

One final battle was fought at the Angivarian Wall west of modern Hanover, and again many Germanic soldiers were killed, which forced them to flee. In summer 16 AD, Caius Silius marched against the Chatti with 33,000 men. Germanicus invaded the Marsi for a third time and devastated their land. 

With his main goals reached and winter coming, Germanicus ordered his army back to their winter camps, with the fleet incurring some damage from a storm in the North Sea. After a few more raids across the Rhine, which resulted in the recovery of two of the three Roman legions' eagles lost in 9 AD, Tiberius ordered the Roman forces to halt and withdraw across the Rhine. Germanicus was recalled to Rome and informed by Tiberius that he would be given a Triumph and be given a new command.

Germanicus' campaign had been to revenge the defeat at Teutoburg, and also partly in reaction to signs of mutiny amongst his troops.
Arminius, who had been considered a real threat to stability by Rome, was now defeated. Once his allied Germanic coalition had been broken and honour avenged, the huge cost and risk of keeping the Roman army operating beyond the Rhine was simply not worth any likely benefit to be gained.

The last chapter of this story is told by the historian Tacitus. Around 50 AD, bands of Chatti invaded Roman territory and began to plunder (take everything of value). The Roman commander, with a legionary force supported by Roman cavalry and auxiliaries, attacked the Chatti from both sides and defeated them. Great was the joy when they found Roman prisoners, including some from Varus' legions who had been held by the Chatti for 40 years.

The battle, and the histories of Tacitus, had a big effect on 19th century German nationalism. In the 19th century the Germans were still divided into many German states, but they linked themselves with the Germanic tribes as shared ancestors of one "German people".

In 1808, the German author Heinrich von Kleist's play "Die Hermannsschlacht" aroused anti-Napoleonic sentiment, even though it could not be performed under French occupation. 

Later, the figure of Arminius was used to represent the ideals of freedom and unification – as supported by German liberals, and opposed by reactionary rulers. A memorial – the Hermannsdenkmal – was begun during this period, and Arminius became a symbol of "Pan-Germanism". The monument remained unfinished for decades, until after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 unified the country. The completed monument was then a symbol of conservative German nationalism.

Hyakunin isshu is a popular game in Japan.It is played often during the New year season. A few games are possible using these cards.

Karuta asobi(かるた遊び) is the most popular game. A reader reads Kaminoku (the upper words) and Shimonoku (the lower words), and the players compete to see how fast they can pick the matching card. The Shimonoku is not written on the cards, so the players who memorize the Kaminoku have an advantage. The player who can get the most cards wins.

Bozu mekuri(坊主めくり) does not use Yomifuda.


The winner is the player who has the most cards when all the cards are have been used.

Liquid crystal

Liquid crystals are special substances that are usually liquid, but that show certain properties of a solid crystal. A liquid crystal (LC) may flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be rotated in a crystal-like way. There are many different types of liquid crystal phases. Different phases are different because their optical properties are different. Using a microscope and a polarized light source, different liquid crystal phases will have different textures. This is also shown in the image. 

The contrasting areas in the texture each correspond to a domain where the LC molecules are rotated in a different direction. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in an LC phase (just as water is not always in the liquid phase: it may also be found in the solid and gaseous phase).

Turing complete

A computer is Turing complete if it can do anything that any Turing machine can do, if it had all the time, memory, and software that it needs. If it can do anything that any Turing machine can do, that proves that it can do anything that any computer can do. It does not mean the computer can let you type something in the same way, or that it will show the same graphics. It means that it can change one set of numbers to another set of numbers in the same way.

For instance, a computer from Dell can do anything that a computer from Hewlett-Packard can do, and the Hewlett-Packard can do anything the Dell can do. One computer might need more time, memory, and software (including the operating system) to do what another computer can do, and it might need a different keyboard, monitor or other input/output, but you would not need a new CPU chip. Any well-known computer is Turing complete. But the simplest calculators are not Turing complete. All they can do is add, subtract, multiply, and divide. They cannot play chess for instance, no matter how you try to combine their four functions.

River Trent

The River Trent is one of the major rivers of England. It starts in Staffordshire. It flows through the centre of England until it joins the River Ouse to form the Humber which empties into the North Sea.

The name "Trent" comes from a Celtic word possibly meaning "strongly flooding". More specifically, the name may be a contraction of two Celtic words, "tros" ("over") and "hynt" ("way"). 
It is unusual amongst English rivers in that it flows north (for the second half of its route), and is also unusual in exhibiting a tidal bore, the "Aegir". The area drained by the river includes most of the northern Midlands.

The river is legally navigable for some below Burton upon Trent. However for practical purposes, navigation above the southern terminus of the Trent and Mersey Canal (at Shardlow) is conducted on the canal, rather than on the river itself. 

At certain times of the year, the lower tidal reaches of the Trent experience a tidal bore which can be up to five feet (1.5m) high.

History of post-Soviet Russia

Because of the end of the Soviet Union, Russia went through a large change politically, economically, and militarily. First off the Soviet Union became the Russian Federation. People now consider that the Federation is a follow up of the Soviet Union. However, Post-Soviet Russia lacked the military and political power of the former USSR. Now that communism died, Russia could elect a President. in June of 1991 the first president in Russian history was elected, his name was Boris Yeltsin. 

The election of Boris Yeltsin showed a new future in Russia. He told his people that he would help the economy. One thing he did was help improve trade with other countries. However, not all his ideas would be good. When Yeltsin lifted price controls a huge sudden increase in prices occurred (hyperinflation.) Also because the military was hit hard during the fall of the Soviet Union, many plants laid off workers because the Government was not sending the plants any new orders. this lead to large unemployment. 
In 1998 a large financial crisis hit Russia. The Value of the Ruble fell a lot. Massive tax evasion also occurred. The government stopped making payment of wages, pensions and when workers were paid, it was often with goods rather than rubles.
Despite this, Russia came back from the August 1998 financial crash with speed. This was because the price of oil went up. Having the prices of oil go up, the exportation of the oil form Russia would cost more, this would bring in lots of money for the economy.

Unlike in the Cold war, Russia now said that the West was considered an ally. In June of 1998 they joined the NATO peace-keeping forces. The Russians also have begun relationships with China. In 1997 the Russians made a treaty with Belarus 

Russia in the 21st century has gone through many changes. in 2000 Vladimir Putin was made President of Russia. Through his term he had good and bad approval ratings. In 2001-2002 Putin took over several media stations. Issues like this have also occurred with print media. However Putin has done good things for Russia, Indeed, during real GDP grew on average 6.7% a year, average income increased 11% annually, and a positive balance of the federal budget now let the government to cut 70% of its debt during his term.

Hurricane Henriette (2007)

Hurricane Henriette was the deadliest tropical cyclone of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season. The storm, which caused nine fatalities, formed from an area of cloud on August 30, 2007, and became a tropical storm the next day. The storm moved along the Mexican Pacific coast, and it rained very heavily. The city that had the most problems was Acapulco, Guerrero, where six people were killed by landslides, and where over 100 families had to leave after the La Sabana River flooded. Henriette then turned north and headed towards the Baja California peninsula, and became a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Henriette made its first landfall east of Cabo San Lucas when it was at its strongest, causing the death of one woman because of rough seas.

Hurricane Henriette then moved over the Sea of Cortez, and made its second landfall near Guaymas, Sonora. After causing heavy rains in Sonora, the storm weakened over the Sierra Madre Occidental and what was left went on to cause flooding in New Mexico and Texas. The damaged caused cost about $275 million (2007 MXN, $25 million 2007 USD). It hit Mexico on the same day Hurricane Felix hit Nicaragua, only one of two time when an Atlantic hurricane and a Pacific hurricane have made landfall on the same day.

Henriette originated from a tropical wave that departed the west coast of Africa on August 20, 2007. The wave produced some convection while in the Caribbean Sea but reached central America on August 28 before any significant development could occur. Early on August 30, the area of low pressure, now 400 miles (640 km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico, started to gain clusters of strong convection. By the afternoon of August 30 the system continued to show strong convection and had developed a broad but well defined area of low to mid level cyclonic turning. By 0600 UTC that day the system became a tropical depression about southeast of Acapulco and was designated as Tropical Depression Eleven-E.

Convection continued but the cyclone was encountering extensive easterly to north-easterly wind shear which stinted the strengthening of this storm through out its history. The cyclone initially headed toward the west-northwest around a subtropical ridge that was centered over the western Gulf of Mexico. The depression moved north west, parallel with the west coast of Mexico due to being steered by the mid/upper-level ridge. On August 31, it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette, 85 miles (137 km) south of Acapulco. 

It continued to move along the Mexican coast bringing heavy rains. With continued strong convection, Henriette maintained its strengthening and was predicted to reach hurricane strength. However, despite the low wind shear and apparent warm waters. Henriette did not strengthen as expected. This is believed to be due to its close proximity to land and colds waters being brought up due to Henriette's slow movement. The convection and strengthening continued and maintained itself as it moved away from Jalisco. Henriette turned westward and away from the Pacific coast of Mexico late on September 1 as the subtropical ridge built westward over northern Mexico.

Henriette continued to improve in structure and with the formation of a distinct eye feature, reached hurricane strength on September 4 as it turned north-northwestward toward the Baja California peninsula, ahead of a mid-latitude trough approaching the west coast of the United States. The hurricane reached its peak intensity of 85 mph (135  km/h) that morning while centered about 75 miles (120 km)south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas.

The center of Henriette made landfall just east of Cabo San Lucas on the afternoon of September 4 with maximum winds near  (130  km/h). It was over land for only about six hours before emerging into the Sea of Cortez. The brief interaction with land caused a slight weakening, but Henriette remained a Category 1 hurricane for most of that day. The next day it made final landfall near Guaymas in the state of Sonora. Henriette weakened quickly over land and dissipated over the mountains of northwestern Mexico early on September 6. The remnants of Tropical Storm Henriette continued to track across west Texas and southeastern New Mexico as it was being absorbed by a cold front moving through New Mexico. The flow of moisture from originating from these remnants, moderate instability, and marginal shear contributed to flash flooding and severe thunderstorms.

The formation of Henriette was not anticipated well in NHC Tropical Weather Outlooks. The incipient system was first mentioned only about 31 hours before it became a tropical depression, and the potential for the formation of a depression was explicitly stated beginning only about 13 hours prior to genesis.

On August 31, 2007 the National Meteorological Service in Mexico decreed zone of alert from Lagunas de Chacahua, Oaxaca to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. It requested the public to take precautions before the possible coming of rain, intense winds and storm surges in the south and southwestern coasts of Mexico. The Ministry of Education of Guerrero canceled classes at all schools in the evening and close the port navigation. Faced with the prospect of Henriette strengthening, The Head of the Harbor Bay in Acapulco stopped all travel for small craft and coastal fisheries. Also blue and yellow flags were raised as a preventive measure for swimmers. On September 4, the port of Mazatlán, Sinaloa had to be shut down to all navigation due to the inclement weather produced by the hurricane. The port authority reported that Henriette produced waves surpassing 4 meters (13 ft) in height. The Carnival Pride cruise scheduled to arrive at the port had to be diverted out to sea as a result of the port's closure. In the city itself, school was suspended for two days, and officials stated that approximately 600 famiilies might have to be evacuated. Further north, the port of Topolobampo, Sinaloa was also closed due to Henriette's threat, and 20 families were evacuated from their homes in an ejido.

In La Paz, the Municipal Direction of Civil defense informed that the first of 13 temporary shelters would be opened and anticipated the evacuation of more than 2000 people that lived in high-risk zones. In some areas, the local police recommended to the population, mostly those living in areas of high risk, that they should take care not to leave their homes unless necessary and to find evacuation routes and temporary shelters. Both Manuel Márquez de León International Airport in La Paz and Los Cabos International Airport in San José del Cabo were shut down, stranding 7,500–8,500 tourists. Henriette also forced the ports in Los Cabos to close completely, and the port in La Paz to close to small craft.

Henriette struck hardest in the resort town of Acapulco. Though the storm never passed closer than to the town, heavy rains along the coast saturated the ground, leading to mudslides. Six people were reported dead as a result of rockslides in two suburban neighborhoods of the city and in the port itself. Three were killed by a huge rock hitting their house, and the other three were killed when their dwellings partially collapsed. In addition, flooding from the overflowing of the River La Sabana, led to the evacuation of at least one hundred families from around the river by the Consejo Estatal de Proteccion Civil.

Jorge Antonio Pacheco Albert, Director of Civil Protection for the Port of Acapulco, reported that approximately 800 were injured during the passage of Henriette along the coast and that 337 people relocated to temporary shelters. In Michoacán, Henriette damaged 10,000 square meters (107,000 sq. ft) of beach near Ixtapilla, destroying approximately 5,000 Olive Ridley turtle nests, comprising 10% of the endangered species's nests in the state.

In Sonora, the hurricane destroyed 450 homes and damaged another 5,000 dwellings in Etchojoa and Huatabampo, which both have large Mayo Indian populations. The storm's precipitation flooded nearby agricultural fields, stopping wheat production, forcing local government to fumigate the region to try to prevent a dengue fever outbreak. In the Yaqui River valley, two people were killed, and another 70 homes were destroyed by Henriette's winds. Throughout the state, 24,000 families were left homeless. 

One woman died due to high surf near Cabo San Lucas on the Baja California peninsula. Two fishermen were reported killed off the Sonora coast.
The road connecting Guaymas to Ciudad Obregón was closed due to damage from the overflow of the brook Cocoraque which stranded around 600 cars. Lázaro Cárdenas was affected when the Acalpican River broke its banks. At least 50 houses located in the community of "El Habillal", were flooded by water levels of up to . The residents had to leave their houses and be relocated in provisional housing. 
The remnants of Henriette caused flash floods and surface water 8–12 inches (20–30 cm) deep which covered roads with depths up to 1.5 inches (4 cm) in the U.S. States of New Mexico and Texas. Hail also accumulated on roadways. Damage in Mexico totaled about $275 million (2007 MXN, $25 million 2007 USD). The name "Henriette" was not retired from use by the World Meteorological Organization, and will be used again in 2013.

Charles Stewart Parnell

Charles Stewart Parnell (27 June 1846 – 6 October 1891) was an Irish Anglican politician in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which was at his time included Ireland. He started the Irish Parliamentary Party. He played an important part in the fight for Ireland's fight for self-government.

Charles Stewart Parnell was born in Avondale, County Wicklow. His family was upper class. He was the seventh child of John Henry Parnell and his American wife Delia Tudor Stewart. Parnell's great-grandmother was in the Tudor family so he was related to the British Royal Family.. 

His parents separated when he was six. He was sent to different schools in England, where he was unhappy. His father died in 1859 and he inherited his fortune. He then studied at Cambridge University (1865-9) but never graduated.

Charles Stewart Parnell was first elected to the House of Commons, as a Home Rule League MP for Meath, on 21 April 1875. During his first year Parnell mostly stayed quiet and watched. He first drew attention in 1876 when he said a group of Irish rebels called Fenians (who were accused of killing a police officer) did not kill anyone.

Parnell fought for Ireland's right to be self governing Home Rule Movement. At first he met with Fenians, but he later decided to work with Michael Davitt. He was elected president of Davitt's movement, (called the "Land League") on 21 October 1879. After becoming the MP for Cork City, he formed a new group with ideas from many other groups called the Irish National League which later became the Irish Parliamentary Party. Although Ireland did not become its own nation for many years, Parnell's work in Parliament pushed Ireland much closer to their goal by unifying Irish politics.

On 24 December 1889 Captain William O’Shea decided to divorce his wife Katherine O'Shea, saying that she had an affair and three children with Parnell. Parnell did not try to stop the divorce. Because divorce is not allowed by Catholics, many Catholics who supported Parnell did not like him anymore and he became less popular.

Parnell married Katherine in 1891. The damage from his affair caused many people to lose respect for him, and he became less powerful. Many members of his party left him. He died on 6 October 1891 of a heart attack and in the arms of his wife. He was only 45 years old.

Sinhala language

Sinhalese or Sinhala (සිංහල, ISO 15919: siṁhala, pronounced [ˈsiŋhələ], earlier referred to as Singhalese) is the language of the Sinhalese, the largest ethnic group of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Indo-Aryan language family.

Sinhala is spoken by about 19 million people in Sri Lanka, about 16 million of them are native speakers. It is one of the constitutionally-recognised official languages of Sri Lanka, along with Tamil. Sinhala has its own writing system (see Sinhala script) which is an offspring of the Indian Brahmi script.

The oldest Sinhala inscriptions were written in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE; the oldest existing literary works date from the 9th century CE.

The closest relative of Sinhala is the language of the Maldives, Dhivehi.

The word order of Sinhala language is SOV (subject-object-verb) just like Japanese, Korean and many other asian languages. It would be easy for people from that particular language style to learn Sinhala with a little time and practice.

Ex 1 : 
Ex 2 : 

Morphologically, the words are built with the stem followed by a particle. The particle can vary so that it adds more grammatical change into the word connecting it to the whole sentence. 

pusa yanawa -
pusath yanawa - 

ballata denawa -
ballatath denawa 
ballatama denawa 

yes, its easy if you really have a good look at these sentences. you may easily find the stem of the words- pusa, pusath, ballata, ballathath, ballatama.

pusa- is the stem of the subjectival phrase. (kitten)

Pusa + th - as well

pusa + ta - to kitty

pusa + ta + th - to kitty as well

pusa + ta + ma - to kitty itself

Bacchus

Bacchus was the Roman god of agriculture and wine, similar to the Greek Dionysus.

He was the last god to join the twelve Olympians; Hestia gave up her seat for him.
His plants were vines and twirling ivy. He often carried a pinecone-topped staff, and his followers were goat-footed Satyrs and Maenads, wild women who danced energetically during his festivals.

Bacchus was the child of Jupiter (whose Greek name is Zeus) and Semele, a human whom Juno (whose Greek name is Hera) had tricked into asking to see Jupiter as he really was. Since she was a mortal, she was burned up by the sight of Jupiter in his divine form. So Jupiter sewed the infant Bacchus into his thigh, and gave birth to him nine months later. As a child, Bacchus was tutored by Silenus, who was a great lover of wine and often had to be carried on the back of a donkey. Before he took his place at Olympus, Bacchus wandered the world for many years, going as far as India to teach people how to grow vines.

Modernism

Modernism was a cultural movement in the first part of the 20th century. It occurred in art, literature, music, architecture and drama. 

Modernism is marked by a rejection of tradition, and an interest in new ways of doing old things. Also, there was a belief that the application of science and technology could change the world for the better. The changes began in the late 19th century and carried on until about 1950. The details differ greatly, and the term covers some movements which are somewhat contradictory.

Art is where people can find Modernism. Modern art is what replaced classical art. It included Abstract art, Cubism, Pop art, Minimalism, and Dadaism. It affected sculpture quite strongly, though at the beginning sculptors like Rodin and Epstein made both traditional and modernist works. Henry Moore is one of the most famous modernist sculptors.

Typical modernist painters were Picasso, Braque, Matisse, Kandinsky and Mondrian.

Composers such as Stravinsky, George Antheil and Schonberg are modernists. Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring" ("Le Sacre du Printemps") is a landmark work.

James Joyce's "Ulysses" is the classic example of modernism in the novel. "Ulysses" has been called "a demonstration and summation of the entire Modernist movement".

Modernism in architecture is found in the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, and Mies van der Rohe. Le Corbusier's famous remark "A building is a machine for living in" shows how different his thinking was to architects of the 19th century. The skyscraper, such as Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building in New York (1956–1958), became the archetypal modernist building.

A criticism of the modern movement is that it doesn't value tradition, and that it goes in for change for the sake of change. What Modernists want most is freedom of expression, or, perhaps, freedom of experimentation. This is why many modern paintings avoid making visual copies of real things. In modernist literature, an author may leave out plots or narrative or characterization in books.

These experiments were not random. They drew on the ideas of their day: mass media, science and technology, Marxism, Freudian psychology, and so on. There was a general search for new materials, new methods and new ideas. There was often a rejection of elitism, and 
a love of populism and popular culture.

Another criticism was of the connection between modernism and socialism. Certainly many modernists were also socialists. In the early days of socialism it seemed to offer hope of a new future without the baggage of the past. This also explains their rejection of tradition.

Victorian era

The Victorian era of the United Kingdom was a time of Queen Victoria's rule from 1837 to 1901. This time was very prosperous for the British people. Trade was at its best. A very well educated middle class ruled the British World.
The population of England had almost doubled from 16.8 million in 1851 to 30.5 million in 1901, due to the large immigration during the later part of the 20th century.

One nice creation in the Victorian era was the making of the sewage system in London. In 1829 photography was realized. Gas lighting was important too. These lights could be found on the streets, in homes and in public buildings. In 1882 the famous electric bulb was created, which would change people's lives forever.

When theaters opened up in London, orchestras and symphonies played and opera were widely attended. Gambling at cards and the creation of casinos were popular during the period. In the middle of the 19th century saw The Great Exhibition of 1851, the first World's Fair, and showed the greatest creations of the century.

Destalinization

De-Stalinization is the way that the Soviet Union tried to undo Joseph Stalin's politics and the heroic image he created of himself using propaganda.

After Stalin died, Nikita Khrushchev became the new leader of the Soviet Union. He attempted to reform the Soviet government. In order to do this, he had to change the way the public thought of Stalin, who was the leader of the old ways that Khrushchev wanted to change. He did this by many ways, but most importantly he took Stalin's body out of the mausoleum in Red Square and he changed the name of Stalingrad (which was named after Stalin) to Volgograd.

Hughes Medal

The Hughes Medal is awarded by the Royal Society of London "in recognition of an original discovery in the physical sciences, particularly electricity and magnetism or their applications". Named after David E. Hughes, the medal is awarded with a gift of £1000. The medal was first given to J. J. Thomson in 1902 "for his numerous contributions to electric science, especially in reference to the phenomena of electric discharge in gases", and has been awarded 105 more times. The only year that no medal was awarded was 1924; the Royal Society have not given a reason why. Unlike other Royal Society medals, the Hughes Medal has never been awarded to the same person more than once. The most recent winner was Michele Dougherty, who was awarded the medal "for innovative use of magnetic field data that led to discovery of an atmosphere around one of Saturn's moons and the way it revolutionised our view of the role of planetary moons in the Solar System".

The medal has on occasion been awarded to more than one person at once; in 1938 it was won by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton "for their discovery that nuclei could be disintegrated by artificially produced bombarding particles", in 1981 by Peter Higgs, Thomas Walter and Tom W. B. Kibble "for their international contributions about the spontaneous breaking of fundamental symmetries in elementary-particle theory", in 1982 by Drummond Matthews and Frederick Vine "for their elucidation of the magnetic properties of the ocean floors which subsequently led to the plate tectonic hypothesis" and in 1988 by Archibald Howie and M.J. Whelan "for their contributions to the theory of electron diffraction and microscopy, and its application to the study of lattice defects in crystals".

J. J. Thomson

Sir Joseph John "J.J." Thomson, OM, FRS (18 December 1856 – 30 August 1940) was a British physicist and Nobel laureate. He discovered the electron and isotopes, and invented the mass spectrometer. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906 for his discovery of the electron and his work on the conduction of electricity in gases. John Joseph Thomson in 1893 said: "There is no other branch of physics which affords us so promising an opportunity of penetrating the secret of electricity." 

Circling around his work with the atomic theory, J.J Thomson was the third in a line of five to come up with a theory. He hypothesized that atoms were spheres of evenly spread positive charge, where an individual negatively charged electron resided. He later concluded there were more than one negatively charged particle in an atom.

Terraforming

Terraforming is a process of taking an inhabitable planet and making it habitable for living organisms. This can be done by adding an atmosphere, heat, and water.
Mars is considered by many to be the best candidate for terraformation. Much study has been done on the possibility of heating the planet and altering its atmosphere, and NASA has put some input into this idea, but the economic resources to terraform are far too much for any government to be willing to donate.

Many people say that it is possible to terraform Mars, our Moon, Titan, Callisto, Mercury and dozens of other moons.
Looking at what we did to this earth, many people think that planets should be left without human interference. Others say that terraforming sounds ethically sound once we know that the planet we are terraforming has no other life of its own, but if it does, while we should not try to reshape the planet to our own use, we should engineer the planet's environment to artificially nurture the alien life and help it thrive and co-evolve, or even co-exist with humans.

There are many potential political issues for terraforming a planet, such as who gets to own the terraformed land on the new planet. It could be national governments, organizations like the United Nations, corporations etc. Such settlements may become national disputes as countries try to make portions of other planets part of their own national territory.

Kenneth Clarke

Kenneth Harry 'Ken' Clarke (born 2 July 1940) is a British politician. He is the Justice Secretary in the current British government. Clarke has had a long career in politics and has served in the cabinets of Margaret Thatcher and John Major.

Clarke was born in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, England and was educated at the University of Cambridge. He became the Member of Parliament for Rushcliffe at the 1970 General Election and became a Queen's Counsel in 1980. He held a number of lower positions in government under Margaret Thatcher until she promoted him to Health Secretary in 1988. He became Education Secretary in 1990 and when Thatcher resigned as Prime Minister and was replaced with John Major he stayed on as Health Secretary until 1992 when he was promoted to Chancellor of the Exchequer. He stayed as Chancellor until 1997 when the Conservatives were defeated in the General Election.

John Major resigned as leader of the Conservative Party soon after he was defeated in the general election and Clarke stood for election to replace him as leader and therefore become the Leader of the Opposition. However he was defeated by William Hague in this contest. When Hague himself resigned after losing the 2001 General Election Clarke again stood for leader but was defeated by Iain Duncan Smith. In 2005 he stood for the leadership for a third time but was defeated by David Cameron. It is thought that Clarke was unable to become leader because many in the Conservative Party do not wish to see the United Kingdom replace the pound with the Euro as the main currency whereas Clarke has always been very much in favour of this policy.

Clarke returned to the Conservative front bench in 2009 as the Shadow Business Secretary where he has the job of monitoring the performance of the current Business Secretary Peter Mandelson. When the coalition government was formed on 11 May 2010 Clarke was made the Justice Secretary.

Die Lollipops

Die Lollipops is a children's band which formed in Germany in the summer of 2000 under the Edelkids label, a division of a German company named Edel Music. According to the label's website, the primary intended audience for the band is German-speaking children between 4 and 10 years old.

Their music can be divided into three basic types: 

Examples of famous international children's songs whose melody has been borrowed and given entirely new lyrics:
"Die" is German for "the" (plural); "Lollipops" is a loanword from English. The most common German word for lollipop is "Lutscher", but Germans now also use "Lollipop". The band debuted in July 2000 with an album called "die Lollipops" and have released new CDs, videos, and audio books at the rate of about two per year. As of 2005, their label had sold more than 1.5 million of their CDs and videos, of which 8 made it to gold, and one made it to platinum. Note that the meanings of the terms platinum and gold are different for different countries: in Germany gold signifies 100,000 sales and platinum 200,000. 

Die Lollipops has featured two singers at a time for most of its history; generally these have been girls between the ages of about 11 and 16. Because the band has been around for nine years, they must replace their singers with new ones every few years. The current duet started recording in late 2007 with Susi and Fiona (then 12 and 11 years old respectively). They released an album called "Einfach tierisch" in March 2008, and plan to release another one called "Immer in Bewegung" in July 2009. Peter Hoffmann has remained the producer since the group was formed. The band has attracted composers from other bands registered by Edel Music; a singer named Klaus Büchner had written a song about drinking alcohol called "Wir feiern wieder Feste" in 1987 when he was singing in his own band, called Klaus & Klaus; he then re-wrote it as a children's song about a never-ending party for die Lollipops. The title of the song is still the same and the syllable rhythms are similar, especially in the chorus. 

Due to the language barrier, the Lollipops are largely unheard of outside the German-speaking world. Their music can be downloaded via websites such as Amazon.com.

Most Pikas live in colder climates, on rocky mountain slopes, in Asia, North America and parts of Eastern Europe. They are active during the day or the twilight, that is at nightfall, and in early morning. Pikas do not hibernate. They collect hay, which they pile up to dry. They sometimes steal hay from each other. This often results in disputes. Predators, like ferrets, and large birds often use such disputes to catch pikas. 

Pikas in Eurasia lead their lives in family groups, they also share their duties. The pikas in North America don't, they are asocial outside the breeding season.

The hypothesis claims that the Gospels of Matthew and Luke were written based on the gospel of Mark, and lost source text, called Q. The Q is for German "Quelle", and means source. The lost document was likely a collection of Jesus' sayings, very probably written in Ancient Greek. The hypothesis is widely accepted among Christian scholars.

There are two major problems with this hypothesis:

Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia

The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was the Yugoslav state that existed from the second half of World War II (1945) until it was formally dissolved in 1992 ("de facto" dissolved in 1991 with no leaders representing it) amid the Yugoslav wars. It was a socialist state and a federation made up of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. In 1992, the two remaining states still committed to a union, Serbia and Montenegro, formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which had not been recognized as the successor of the SFRY by international leaders.

A provisional parliament met in August 1945, comprising delegates from all parts of the country plus 68 representatives of prewar political parties and 13 independents. Elections for a bicameral parliament, which was to comprise a federal council and a council of nationalities and was to have the powers of a constituent assembly, were held on 11 November 1945: no political opposition to the People's Front was allowed. This situation caused the three royalist representatives, Grol-Subasic-Juraj Sutej, to secede from the provisional government indeed voting was on a single list of People's Front candidates with provision for opposition votes to be cast in separate voting boxes but this procedure made electors identifiable by OZNA agents. A powerful election campaign was mounted to ensure a large majority for Josip Broz Tito's People's Front, the general organization behind which the communist party operated. 

In Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia mass killings or massacres have occurred during regimes of Josip Broz Tito and Slobodan Milosevich and many massacres are holded also war crimes. 

During and after WW II communist Yugoslav Partisans engaged in mass murder against POW and suspected enemies in concentration camps and in deportation. Brutal incidents were Bleiburg, Vojvodina and foibe massacres and Kočevski Rog butchery. 
Actually concealed mass graves are found by Committee for the Marking and Maintenance of Graves from World War II and the Post-war, Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Serbia and Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia.

During Broz Tito's regime many political dissidents were imprisoned and around 4,000 were tortured and assassinated in Goli Otok alone, but total number of victims in all prisons is unknown.

Milošević was indicted by Martin Houston in May 1999, during the Kosovo War, by the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for crimes against humanity in Kosovo.

Players can complete missions, but these are not needed to get farther into the game to open content. When the player does a crime and the police see it, they will start to follow the player and try to catch him.

Secure Digital card

A Secure Digital card (SD card) is a kind of memory card. Such cards are often used to store images or data in digital cameras. As of 2008, different capacities between 4 Megabytes and 32 gigabytes have been made. The card has a rectangular design, but one edge is "chipped off". This means that the cards cannot be inserted into the cameras (or other devices) the wrong way.

There are different kinds of cards:


The two standards are not compatible, but devices that accept SDHC also accept SD cards.

There are also different "classes". These refer to the read and write speeds. Currently in use are "Class 2" - which means 2 MBytes/second, "Class 4" - 4 MB/sec and "Class 6" at 6 MB/sec. The problem with this is that different manufacturers measure different things with it, some measure write speeds, others read speeds. There are also differences because some give guarantees, and others simply say that the speeds they indicate are the maximum achievable under good conditions.

Still another measurement is called "rating". A rating of 1 corresponds to 150 KBytes per second, the read speed of a CD. That way, a class 2 is equal to a speed of 13x.

Hi everyone. It isn't a mistery anymore, we need more editors to maintain the project. If any of you have any ideas, please say so. Thanks, 15:20, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

Has anyone thought of putting in a call for editors at the English Wikipedia? // // 03:58, 18 May 2009 (UTC)

The Main Page of the English Wikipedia puts Simple up top, but not too many people actually look at the toolbox. There is almost no precedent for cross-wiki promotions; the only one I can recall is the 10 milionth article across all Wikipedias (), which ranked in 40,000 hits when it was splashed on the front page of Wikipedia . A major problem bogging Simple down are a clear lack of precision as to what "Simple" means, as well as a lackluster Google ranking: American Airlines Flight 11 has a #1 ranking (English) and #40 (Simple), despite both being Featured Articles. () 03:29, 19 May 2009 (UTC)

I give you a proposal to change name of to Wikipedia:Blocking policy. Reason:It is, by my opinion, more proper name and watch also regular english Wikipedia.-- 10:07, 18 May 2009 (UTC)

But, only block (blocks) is OK, because there is no bans here, but there is blocks.-- 21:02, 18 May 2009 (UTC)

Can an admin with a spare moment kindly unprotect my talkpage? I wish to return to active editing. Even though I did state an intention to leave the project, I think I would be able to able help out after taking about 3.5 months off. Thanks in advance! 23:21, 18 May 2009 (UTC)

If there are no objections within 24 hours, I'm going to start speedy-deleting stubs under 20 words long citing QD A1. It's ridiculous to think that we have 20,000 articles in which the stub tag is longer than the content itself. – |  23:45, 18 May 2009 (UTC)

What do you think deleting 20,000 stubs will do? Clog up the deletion log. Spend a ton of server resources moving the articles from the regular table to the "deleted" table, since nothing ever is deleted from Wikipedia. Spend your time in having to delete them, if it's script-assisted that's still your time. The only tangible thing it would do is to lower the article count, which is a mostly meaningless number that does not denote quality (I think we just hit 2,500 FAs on English, up against 2.8 million articles). A1 is completely irrelevant and is not a valid justification. They have plenty of context: they're rivers in Romania. This isn't a case where you do not have a clue as what the topic is about. We know what they are. Yes, stubs are a problem. Deleting them is not the way to do it. Insist that no more 20-word stubs be created. It would be productive then to carry through by deleting them on sight to prove that you're being serious. () 03:29, 19 May 2009 (UTC)

Yes the rivers, asteroids and communes are annoying when you hit the random page button. But apart from that I have managed to find a quite a peaceful relationship with them...they don't bother me, I don't bother them. In my opinion keeping them in their current shape is wrong but deleting is even more wrong. These stubs do not fall under A1 as they may be short, but they do have a meaning. A4 is also difficult as most of them are notable...So if someone finds a good deletion policy to delete these stubs I'm fine with that but A1 and A4 do not provide sufficiant reasons to delete 20000 stubs in my books.

Not only children use this wikipedia. I think it is used more often by foreigners (those who do not speak English as a native language). It is often used as a base to translate articles from English (simple) into other languages. Therefore, we should have as much articles here as we can, regardless of how "appropriate" they are for children. () 10:00, 19 May 2009 (UTC)
""this Wikipedia is intended for those whose second language is English"" - that's not true () 10:32, 19 May 2009 (UTC)

Hello again. I've been convinced. Many people wanted me to stay, and more people have told me to come back. I do now feel that I can keep it separate from my work. So the question is, what do you think? Will I return to admin/crat duties? I'd prefer the communities thoughts and decisions. Thanks () 18:04, 19 May 2009 (UTC)

Great! Thanks folks. Would someone care to do the ? :) () 08:29, 20 May 2009 (UTC)

I have a concern about 's user name. It sounds like "Will kill" which I don't think is appropriate for a Wikipedia name. Additionally, I have concerns about his editing in calling me a vandal and telling me it is my job to make sure that his out of place, unreliable sources are fixed in the article where they do not belong. Any help? () 10:16, 20 May 2009 (UTC)

Hi from a new editor (although I've been on the main English Wiki for a while !)

I've been cleaning up articles that were on the list at . 

Now that all the articles on this list have been sorted, the page really just provides an extra step to link to:

Pages that link to "Template:Cleanup" 

and

Category:Cleanup needed (which also links back to !)

What should we do here ? () 20:25, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

Hi. I have seen we have a lot of categories such as . Do we need these kind of categories with one page in them or are they pointless? If they are, I'll go ahead and delete them. 21:54, 22 May 2009 (UTC)
I would however, be careful with that, as some categories (probably even the example you use when you get to more recent years) are likely to have articles added to them and should thus not be deleted. But articles for some very specific subcat for example you probably could delete. Basically what I am saying is use some discression. - () 04:31, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

I propose to change name of article: to Wikipedia:Deletion rules or: Wikipedia:Rules of Deletion, not sure how exactly, but have to bee more simpler, if you have better propose names, tell me.-- 22:59, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

In , many of them are redirects. Although ShortPages is quite useful to help expand articles is there anyway to exclude all the redirects and so on? -- () 02:48, 24 May 2009 (UTC)

You know, we often get down on ourselves here at simple about the state of the site, the mission parameters, the goals we have/have not/should have achieved. But I'd like to congratulate all beneficial editors (named, anons and admins) who have helped us get to where we are now. I remember back to the old days of enWP and man did we have teething pains over there! But, it has to be remembered that enWP has thousands upon thousands of editors, and into the seven digit figures of registered users (not counting anons) and I think that in our own way we hold our own for relevance and quality. Sure we don't have articles for everything and many of our articles are stubs, but let's (please) give ourselves a break; we only have a couple of dozen editors and it's never really gone above that figure. Yet, here we are, 5 years or so later and we are still alive, still going pretty strong and to boot, we are a much nicer place to hang out at than many other WMF sites! 

So, can we all take a moment after reading this and pat ourselves on the back and realise just WHAT has been acomplished? We've survived multiple closure attempts and we are ALL still contributing to simple in our own little ways and we continue to have more articles and to grow faster than many wikis based upon national languages.

Hello all, and indeed congratulations so far. Here are those issues I see (my opinion, you are free to disagree). I have ranked the issues, most important first.
Thats about all I can think of, at the moment. -- () 08:14, 24 May 2009 (UTC)
I'm mildly confused by the concept of GA/VGA being a "pet process" of one (or a few) editor(s): Bloc Party by Garden, Tropical Storm Barry (2007) by Julian, Crich Tramway Village by Bluegoblin7, Romania & Charles Spurgeon by Razorflame, Gothic architecture by Eptalon, Powderfinger by Giggy... seems to be quite varied to me. And sure, some of us put more effort into reviews and put more articles up for nomination, but a "pet process" and a process "centred around one editor"? I don't think so. () 10:56, 24 May 2009 (UTC)

Why this quick update of the main page DYK? My article has only been on there for a day, while others were on there for 10 to 7 days! We cannot update daily on such a small wiki. It wouldn't work - is this some kind of expiriment? () 09:39, 24 May 2009 (UTC)
Please do so. Updating daily is not something we are ready for here on such a small wikipedia, and I want my article and the others to stay on the main page as long as any article so that it can be watched as much and be edited as much. It will only be for the better. Will you move it back now? () 09:47, 24 May 2009 (UTC)

I propose to create a new template stub for internet domains - . Are you agree?-- 17:55, 24 May 2009 (UTC)

I have concerns that the word "notability" is too complex for simple Wikipedia. I think we need to replace the word, especially in our dropdown reasons for deletion. Currently the dropdown reason for deletion is "The article does not show notability." I propose that it should be changed to something else such as "the article does not show why the subject is ___________." I originally thought "important" should go in that blank, but our guidelines say that notability is not the same as importance. Any ideas/suggestions on what we can change it to? () 15:13, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

Change the rule: "If an article has an article on en:wiki, or any other wiki, it can have an article here aswell." () 18:33, 23 May 2009 (UTC)
As you guys mentioned already. Something like: "not known enough"... — This unsigned comment was added by ( • ).

"The content of this article is not important" is "too simple"?

Yeah yeah, "hilarious" topic. 

Articles pertaining to profanity seem to be inconsistent. Fuck redirects to profanity, as there is already a detail definition of the word meaning of the profanity page, yet shit is a page on its own, even though the word "shit" itself is already describe on the profanity page. Should all swear words redirect to the profanity article or should swear words have articles on their own?

I'm not sure if I should take a community vote or if an admin will decide. -- () 01:52, 26 May 2009 (UTC)

I recently imported with an auto-import of the templates it uses. I checked my import first, and thought it would only also import and I did not realize that that would also include . It imported 39 revisions with that I rollbacked but can someone in the know please check to ensure that it is the way seWP wants it? Thanks! (I think I'll import one-at-a-time from now on) Cheers! 05:11, 26 May 2009 (UTC)

http://againbutslower.com/ - thought you'd be interested. Lots of publicity in the Twitterverse. 

I'd like to get some discussion going about implementing a zero tolerance policy regarding users who make edits to seWP that contain homophobic, racist or other similar language or attitudes in articles or towards other users. In reviewing recent contributions, I was shocked to see a named user utter vicious homophobic comments to another user here, be blocked and then have it lifted. Cyber-bullying is now a federal criminal offense in the USA, and I believe it is also an offense in most, if not all, the EU; it certainly is in the UK. Any form of utterance of racist or homophobic comments are also criminal offenses in most of the EU; the UK certainly. I notice that many anons (and some named editors) have used such comments. I think a zero tolerance policy of immediately blocking such users on sight. I tend to block an anon much quicker and with far fewer warnings if I see them use such language in their editing; it is something I find highly disgusting! I've blocked some anons for a first offense in the past. We need to discuss time-limits for the block, but I think we should consider making this an official seWP policy. Obviously we'd need to hash out the full details. (btw: admins already have the "right" to block any user, even for a first offense, for rule breaking at their discretion, I'd just like to formalize the process a bit.) 

It is dependent on the kind of vandalism how many warnings I give the anons before I block them. If the vandalism is really bad (offences, 3 times blanking a page, etc) so they get a block without warning. I think this is an admin decision. Our blocking policy says that admins can block users without or with only a few warnings. And if users create copyvios and so they should get a 72 h block. So they have enough time to read our policies and guidlines. If they do it after this again, so they get an indef block. That is how I work. Rassism, Nazism and such cases are blocked very fast by me without warning. I don't need a policy to do it so. If someone have a problem with how and why I do it so, so they can talk to me on my talk page. Regards, () 12:36, 26 May 2009 (UTC)
Can I see a link to the discussions or a diff for the homophobic slurs here? I don't remember anything as such... 13:00, 26 May 2009 (UTC)

(<-) (usual disclaimers: a) my opinion, free to disagree; b) longer) Hello all, I though a little about this, and here is a longer reply to the statements above.
In my opinion we do not need a policy or guideline beyond what we have (that is ), we need admins that act in a sensible way.
A final note: "If those users actually strike a point about you where you must say it might actually be true, then it is probably time for you to leave - you have left too much personal info on this site." This project is about building am encyclopedia; it is not a social networking site where the "drama" is more important than our purpose.-- () 17:46, 26 May 2009 (UTC)
A good case-in-point to illustrate this issue just came about. This person is a prime example of a person who should be blocked on the first noticed edit and without warning them. In this case it was a mixture of hate speech; and further in this case, the sheer volume of vandalism would warrant a block without warning any way. But, I'd argue that they should (indeed must) be blocked on the first edit they did. 18:59, 26 May 2009 (UTC)

Can any one send stuff to my user talk page im bored () 04:24, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

 is a very good idea. Although we are a little short on active, experienced users, this project could help us with getting long-term contributors to Simple. Would anyone object if I moved this to my userspace and removed some inactive users? 20:54, 28 May 2009 (UTC)

Hello. As you will know, we get a lot of vandalism from schools. Currently we act the same as with regular vandals. BUT we have a . As we are (jointly) aimed at children, I would like to ask everyone to have a look at and see if we can make it easier to read, and perhaps more aesthetically pleasing (graphics/colours) to get kids to read it. I'd like to know if anyone has any other comments on these? 15:07, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

Bots, anyone? – |  05:00, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

I've been thinking for a while about this. We do have 3 checkusers here, but no oversight. Although there would not be "constant" need, there is very much potential for privacy being violated here on Simple. Having a couple trusted oversighters would be very nice. A few I can name off the top of my head as potential candidates are (who has it at EN), and . Thoughts? 14:59, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

Personally, I'd rather oversighters be local, meaning no steward involvement. I'd also believe that its best we restrict this to admins only, and spread it around as to not put too many tools too few people. If we eventually decide to elect users, I'd probably put my name up for consideration. 16:00, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

I thought also about this tool. But I'll oppose the users who are CU and/or 'crat here on simple. Because they have enough to do. If we elect people to have this tool then people who aren't 'crat/CU. To many power in the hand of one people isn't good. If necessary and if I am trusted I would be a volunteer for this tools, because I think this isn't a lot of work. Only some cases in several months. I hope we can elect at least two oversights here on simple. It is better to have a local users rather then asking stewards who aren't familar with this wiki. Regards, () 16:58, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

Yeah I am of age as well so I could do it as well. - () 17:23, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

I'm interested, too, but I don't think I've been around long enough (and actively enough) to be a first choice. There are a few admins on here who would be good choices. Should we have a poll to decide who should run, or wait for someone to be bold and nominate two or three? 17:46, 2 June 2009 (UTC)
I would like to remind everyone that we have who is a steward & admin here. I don't really think we need oversighters here. () 18:57, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

There is not only the reason to hide article version. I remember that there were some accounts created by a vandal IP, which were related to Razorflame. They are renamed I think. So there is an entry in the rename log. Oversighters can not only hide article version they also can hide usernames. This is better then rename users.

The other thing I don't understand: I read here somewhere that we spend our time only in discussions rather then working on other stuff. The opposer reasons are mostly (simplified): not enough discussion about this tool. Do we need for all new improvements a 100 kb discussion? I think no. I understand when an user say I am not long enough here or an admin here. That is a reason. "Not enough discussion" is a stupid reason to oppose an RfO or any other Rfx's in my opinion. And as mentioned above: M7 can do oversight stuff on simple. I disagree. Stewards shouldn't use their tool on projects where they are active. Just my thoughts. () 21:35, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

For what it's worth I think this should be stopped to prevent further ado and discussed until there's a consensus that such a process could survive without being mechanically driven, doomed from the beginning. -- 01:04, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

Integrated Services Digital Network

Integrated Services Digital Network is an international standard for a communication network. It is often shortened to ISDN. It is used for telephone lines. Before ISDN telephone lines were mainly seen as a way for people to make phone calls, so the main idea was to use circuit switching. When a phone call is made, a line is set up between the two participants. With ISDN, this view changes. ISDN offers a number of services, which use the telephone line to transport data. There were different services, like telex or teleprinters before ISDN, but they used their own networks. At specific locations, there were gateways between these networks. With ISDN, this changes. There is only one network, and it offers different services. Some of them are for voice, to make phone calls, others are for data, for example to send telefaxes.

ISDN offers a number of data channels, and a signalling channel. The data channels are completely independent, and can be used independently. The usual setup has two such data channels. That way, it is possible to send a fax, while doing a phone call, for example.

There was a county of Werdenberg. It included the city itself, the villages of Grabs, Buchs, Sevelen and the right to judge in Wartau. The first count of Werdenberg died in 1182. In 1402, his successors let the county to the Count of Montfort-Tettnang. In 1485, it was sold to the City of Lucerne. In 1517, it was sold to the Canton of Glarus. During Napoleon's reign in Switzerland (called the Helvetic Republic, 1798-1803), Werdenberg was made part of the "Canton of Linth" (which also included the modern-day Canton of Glarus, and parts of the Canton of Schwyz).

<doc id="184370" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=184370" title="Édouard Manet">
Édouard Manet

Édouard Manet (pronounced "edwaʁ manɛ" in French), 23 January 1832 – 30 April 1883, was a French Impressionist painter. He was one of the first painters of the 19th century to paint subjects of everyday life in the modern world. This made him very important for modern painting, especially for the change from Realism to Impressionism. 

Some of his paintings were very controversial. The paintings "Lunch on the Grass" and "Olympia" were a starting-point for a group of young painters to develop what would later be called "Impressionism".

Édouard Manet was born in Paris on 23 January 1832, to a wealthy family. As he grew up, his uncle encouraged him to paint and draw, but his father wanted him to join the navy. Eventually he was allowed to be trained as a painter. Manet worked from 1850 to 1856 in the studio of the academic painter Thomas Couture a painter of large historical paintings. In his spare time he copied the old masters in the Louvre. 
While he was a student he visited Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, looking at the paintings of Renaissance and Baroque masters such as Frans Hals, and Spanish painters such as Diego Velázquez and Goya. 

In 1856, Manet opened his own studio. One of the best known French painters of that time was Gustave Courbet who painted in a style known as Realism. Courbet, in his pictures, tried to show the life of the poor working people of the farms and villages. Manet began to paint beggars, singers and people in cafes. His style was not like Courbet's because he used large brushstrokes without much detail. Courbet's paintings were dark and somber because he painted all his canvases brown before he put the figures in. Manet's paintings were brighter and lighter, with lots of white paint and often small parts painted in bright blue and red

In 1863 Manet married Suzanne Leenhoff, who had been employed by his father to teach piano to Manet and his younger brother Eugene. Suzanne had an eleven year old son, Leon Koella Leenhoff who often posed as a model for Manet's paintings.

Every year the academy in Paris would hold a big exhibition (art show) called the "Salon de Paris". In 1863 Manet put a picture into the show called "Lunch on the Grass" ("Le déjeuner sur l'herbe"). The judges at the Salon refused to hang this work in the gallery because it showed a naked woman sitting on the grass with two men wearing clothes. If the painting had been about Ancient Greek mythology, this would not be a problem but these men were wearing ordinary suits, and the woman's dress and hat were lying on the grass. Perhaps she was a prostitute. The judges said that the painting was indecent (very rude). 

At this time there were a group of young artists who mainly painted landscapes. They were Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Frédéric Bazille, Camille Pissarro, Paul Cézanne, and Armand Guillaumin. Monet and his friends also had their paintings turned away. They were angry and they met with Manet to discuss this. The Emperor Napoleon III gave permission for another exhibition called the "Salon des Refuses" which showed all the pictures that had been "refused". Many people went to see this exhibition and soon discovered that there was a new "movement" in art, quite different from the style that they were used to. 

In 1874 thirty Impressionist artists held their first exhibition. The main artists who are called "Impressionists" include Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Edgar Degas and Berthe Morisot. Manet became friendly with Berthe Morisot, who later married his brother Eugene Manet. Manet encouraged Morisot with her painting. Morisot, in turn, encouraged Manet to paint outdoors, in the way that Monet and the other Impressionist painters did. Monet painted some landscapes, seascapes and city scenes in the Impressionist style. However, most of his paintings are "figurative" (they are pictures of people). 

Manet's paintings usually show people going about their ordinary lives. They show people at home and at work, or out and enjoying themselves. One painting is very different. It is a terrible scene showing the execution of the Emperor Maximillian of Mexico by a firing squad.

Khat

Khat is a flowering plant native to tropical East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is also known as qat, qaat, quat, gat, jaad, chat, chad, chaad and miraa. The plant is grown commercially in Kenya, Oman, Yemen and Ethiopia.

Khat is a shrub. When grown commercially, the shrubs grow to a size of about 5m, in the wild they can reach about 20m. 

Khat is used as a stimulant in Yemen, Ethiopia and Somalia, the effects are comparable to those of drinking tea or coffee. 

There are some problems with Khat. People can become psychologically addicted to the drug. Many anti-drug organisations, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration target this drug. 
Many countries control the use of khat, much like a drug; most make its use illegal.

Many farmers in Yemen now produce Khat, instead of other crops, because they get more money for it.

Khat is very popular in Yemen. Much of the country's farming resources go towards it. It is estimated that 40% of the country's water supply goes towards irrigating it. Its production is said to increase by about 10% to 15% every year. Water use in producing khat is so high that groundwater levels in the Sanaa basin are getting lower. For this reason, government officials have proposed to move large portions of the population of Sanaa to the coast of the Red Sea. One of the main reasons Yemen produces so much khat is because the price brings in a high income for farmers. Some studies done in 2001 estimated that the income from growing khat was about 2.5 million Yemeni rials per hectare, while it was only 0.57 million rials per hectare if fruits were grown. This is a strong reason farmers prefer to grow khat over coffee and fruits. It is estimated that between 1970 and 2000, the area on which khat was cultivated grew from 8,000 hectares to 103,000 hectares.

Tropical Storm Barry was a tropical cyclone that grew quickly. It made landfall on Florida in early June 2007. It was the second Atlantic named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. Barry formed in the Gulf of Mexico. It moved toward the northeast, and reached top wind speeds of 60 mph (95 km/h). It then weakened and made landfall near Tampa Bay, Florida. Barry quickly weakened after wind shear blew away most of the thunderstorms. Barry moved up the East Coast of the United States and by June 5, it was taken over by a bigger storm.

Rain from Barry in the province of Pinar del Río, Cuba, hurt three people and damaged 55 houses. In Florida, Barry caused heavy rain in an area that had been in drought. Flooding and wet roads killed two people in traffic accidents. Rough seas killed one surfer in Pinellas County, Florida. In Florida and Georgia, the rain helped firefighters fight bad wildfires. Damage from the storm was minor.

National Capital Region

The National Capital Region is an official Federal name for the Canadian capital of Ottawa, Ontario, and neighbouring Gatineau, Quebec, and the area near them. The National Capital Region has an area of 5,319 square kilometres that straddles the boundary between the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The area of the National Capital Region is almost the same as that of the Ottawa-Gatineau Census Metropolitan Area, although the National Capital Region has a number of small neighbouring communities that are not contained within the CMA. When all the communities are added, the population is 1,451,415.

The National Capital Region is not a separate political jurisdiction, although the National Capital Commission is deeply involved in political, cultural, and land use planning matters in the National Capital Region. Proposals have sometimes been made to separate the National Capital Region from its two respective provinces, and transform it into a separate capital district, like the District of Columbia in the United States or the Australian Capital Territory. Such proposals have never come close to passage, and there does not currently appear to be any political will or necessity to pursue this option.

While not officially in the CMA, the following municipalities (most of which are adjacent to the CMA) are included in the National Capital Region, due to their close economic and social ties with Ottawa.

In the Euclidean space "R" is called orientable if a two-dimensional figure (for example, ) cannot be moved around the surface and back to where it started so that it looks like its own mirror image (). Otherwise the surface is non-orientable. A concept connected to this is chirality. This means that no matter what, a human right hand, cannot be rotated in such a way that it becomes a human left hand. The right hand is therefore orientable.

Kol people

The original inhabitants of modern day Bangladesh and North-east India were the Proto-Austroloid Kols, otherwise known as Kolarians. The term Kol has ubiquitously been corrupted by the Aryan-Sanskritic speakers to the word "kalu", meaning both "black" and "ugly" in almost all of the 16 languages of the Subcontinent. The Kolarians are a Dravidian sect, whose descendant communities can be found also in Bengal (India) and elsewhere in the eastern belt of the Indian continent. Most geological scholars will contend that most of Bangladesh was fashioned 1 to 6.5 million years ago during the tertiary era. Semi-recent excavations in the Deolpota village of western Bengal seem to suggest that a Paleolithic civilization in the region existed about one hundred thousand years ago. A 10,000 to 15,000 year old stone structure in Rangamati is the primary evidence of Paleolithic civilization along with a hand axe found in the mountainous inclines of the Feni district. This Neo-stone age began 3,000 B.C. lasting almost 1500 years. Similar tools were found in Sitakunda of the eastern region Chittagong, and near Comilla district. The sparsely forested hills in eastern Bengal strewn with fertile valleys imparted a hospitable location for Neolithic settlements.

Physically, the Indigenous peoples of eastern India were longheaded, dark skinned, broad-nosed, and short in stature. Sometimes labeled as "Negritos" and "Negroids", their physical features are unchanged today among the lowest castes of Bengal, mainly the peasants, as well as 95% of population of Bangladesh today who derive from these lower castes and tribes.

"Spirit Tracks" takes place 100 years after the events of "". Link is going to graduate to a train engineer. He travels to Hyrule Castle to receive his engineer's certificate from Princess Zelda. Zelda asks Link to bring her out of the castle so she can see the Tower of Spirits, where she thinks something has happened to make the Spirit Tracks fade away. On the way to the Tower of Spirits, the tracks fade from under Link's train and the tower breaks into pieces. The group is attacked by a horned demon named Cole, and a mercenary named Byrne. Cole uses dark magic to separate Zelda's spirit from her body and leaves, taking Zelda's body with him.

"Spirit Tracks" keeps its style of game play from "", in which players use the stylus to control Link and use his weapons, items, and vehicle. The game is divided into an overworld, which Link travels using the Spirit Tracks, and towns and dungeons which he travels by foot. The player moves about the towns and dungeons in order to complete the game's main story. They can also take part in side quests for more rewards. In both the towns and in dungeons, the player is able to make notes on their current map as an aid in puzzle solving.

Bumblebee

Bumblebees (or "Bumble bees", or "Humble bees") are a group of social and semi-social bees, of the genus Bombus. The genus contains about 250 different species, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere, though they are common in New Zealand and Tasmania. They occur practically everywhere on the Eurasian landmass. 

Most bumblebees live in small groups, which generally last only for a year. They collect pollen as protein for their young, and themselves eat nectar. They are extremely hairy, with a covering of soft hairs called a "pile".

Most of them have the same social structure as honey bees do, there is a "queen", and there are "workers" and "drones". The usual size of a colony is under 50 members, though some tropical species live in larger colonies. 

Bumblebees carry aposematic warning colours, usually some combination of black, red, yellow and white. This is the usual Müllerian mimicry found in bees and wasps.
Fertilised queens overwinter in a dormant state. They start a nest in the Spring. The queen stores sperm from her mating, and can decide whether or not to fertilise an egg as it comes down the oviduct to the vagina. The females are diploid, the males are haploid. This is the common method of sex determination throughout the Hymenoptera. 

Only fertilised eggs grow into females, unfertilised ones grow into males. Queens suppress their female workers egg-laying by aggression and pheromones, until late in the season, when the workers do start to lay eggs. 

Thus the queen will be the mother of all the first males. New queens and males leave the colony when they are mature; they mate and the new queens search for a place to overwinter. Then they are dormant over the winter period, starting a new nest in the Spring. That completes the cycle.

About ten species are called cuckoo bumblebees. These are nest parasites: they specialize in invading and taking over the nests of other bumblebees. In these species, there are no workers. Once such an animal has invaded a nest, it will force the workers to feed it and its offspring. Once the offspring are ready, they will leave the hive, to mate and take over other hives.

All bumblebees have a sting, as hive bees do. However, the bumblebee sting does not damage it when used, and they can sting several times. However, they rarely do sting, unless really threatened. 

They have an additional type of defence against birds, and that is their mechanical toughness. Birds usually do not swallow bees whole. If they eat bees at all, they manipulate them to eat the thorax alone, for its wing muscles. This is hard to do with a bumble-bee, and time-consuming. Generally, they are left alone.

Grosvenor Bridge

Grosvenor Bridge, also called Victoria Railway Bridge, is a railway bridge over the River Thames in London, between Vauxhall Bridge and Chelsea Bridge.

It is made up of two bridges, both built in the mid-19th century. The eastern side was built by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway in 1858 to 60 to carry trains into Victoria Station. This was the first railway bridge across the Thames in central London. The western side was built by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1865/66.

Both bridges were rebuilt in steel in 1963–67, the original piers now being wrapped in concrete. The designer for this work was Freeman Fox & Partners.

On the north bank is Pimlico to the north and east and Chelsea to the west. The Lister Hospital and the Royal Chelsea Hospital are immediately to the north west. On the south bank is Nine Elms to the east and Battersea to the west. Battersea Power Station is immediately to the south of the bridge, and Battersea Park to the south west.

Vauxhall Bridge

Vauxhall Bridge is a steel and granite bridge in central London. It crosses the River Thames in a north-west south-east direction between Vauxhall on the south bank and Westminster on the north bank. Opened in 1906, it replaced an earlier bridge as part of a program for redeveloping the south bank of the Thames. The original bridge was itself built on the site of a former ferry.

The building of both bridges was difficult, with both the first and second bridges needing multiple redesigns from multiple architects. The original bridge, the first iron bridge over the Thames, was built by a private company and was run as a toll bridge before being taken into public ownership in 1879. The second bridge, which took eight years to build, was the first in London to carry trams and later one of the first two roads in London to have a bus lane.

The present bridge is most significant for road traffic across the Thames.

List of crossings of the River Thames

This is a list of crossings of the River Thames including bridges, tunnels and ferries. There are 214 bridges, over 20 tunnels, six public ferries and one ford. The list starts at the downstream (Estuary) end and follows the river upstream towards the start of the river.

A few of the crossings listed are public pedestrian crossings making use of walkways across lock gates and bridges above or near-by weirs. Most of the other locks on the River Thames also have walkways across their lock gates and weirs, but these either do not fully cross the river, or are for the use of authorised people only, and are so are not listed.

Besides the ferry crossings listed, there are commuter boat services along the river in London, and tourist boat services running both in London and upstream. Although the main purpose of these services is not to carry people across the river, it may be possible to use them to do so.

<doc id="184632" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=184632" title="Highland Football League">
Highland Football League

The Highland Football League (HFL) is a league of football clubs operating not just in the Scottish highlands, as the name may suggest, but also in the north-east lowlands (Moray and Aberdeenshire). It is one of the three 'senior' non-leagues (that is a league that is not the Scottish Football League (SFL), Scottish Premier League or one of the Scottish Junior Football Association's leagues) in Scotland. The HFL is a full member of the Scottish Football Association.

The HFL was formed on 4 August 1893, at the Inverness Workman's Club. The original league consisted of seven teams: Inverness Thistle, Caledonian, Clachnacuddin, Forres Mechanics, Inverness Union, Inverness Citadel and Cameron Highlanders. Ross County were an eighth original member, but resigned membership in November 1893. Of the original teams, two are still playing in the league today (Clachnacuddin and Forres Mechanics), and two merged to become current Scottish Premier League club Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

Many of the member clubs have performed well when competing against SFL clubs in the Scottish Cup. However, from the 1990s onwards, the HFL has been a victim of its own success, with various teams defecting to other leagues. Furthermore it has also had to contend with overexposure of large teams in the area ,such as Aberdeen and Inverness Caledonian Thistle, as well as the Old Firm to the South, and to an extent English football. However, the lack of Premier League, and to a lesser extent First Division, teams in the area, has worked in its favour, with some football fans being less willing to travel long distances to games in southern Scotland.

The league has been somewhat weakened in recent years by the departure of many former members who have subsequently joined the SFL. This happened in 1994 when Caledonian, Inverness Thistle and Ross County left. Until then the HFL had operated with 18 clubs; this was reduced by the departure of the three mentioned clubs, but Wick Academy from the North Caledonian Football League were elected, to create a league of 16 clubs. This was the state of affairs till 2000 when Elgin City and Peterhead were elected into the SFL. In 2002 Inverurie Loco Works were elected into the HFL to give it a membership of 15 clubs, with which it continues to operate.

In 2008, North Region Junior League sides Formartine United and Turriff United both submitted bids to join the Highland League, following in the footsteps of past Junior League side Inverurie Locos. If both teams were to join, the Highland League would have a total of 17 teams. An even team league is preferred, so only one club's application was likely to be successful. Whichever team is successful in their application was planned to join in the 2009–10 season. However Banks O' Dee and Strathspey Thistle also applied, giving the potential for an 18 team Highland league in 2009-10 if three of these four clubs were elected.
On February 25 2009, Formartine United, Turriff United and Strathspey Thistle were accepted into the league for the following season, with Banks O' Dee being the unsuccessful club.

Results from the HFL and the Highland League Cup have featured on the Press Association vidiprinter since the start of the 1997–98 season.

The Highland League is the subject of a song of the same name by the popular music ensemble I, Ludicrous .


The HFL also administer several other competitions contested by some or all of the clubs. These competitions are:

Meselson–Stahl experiment

The Meselson–Stahl experiment was an experiment done by Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl in 1958, using Ecoli DNA.
With their experiment, the two scientists could show that DNA replication was semiconservative. The DNA consists of two helices that are combined. When the two helices are copied, each will have one part coming from the original cell. The other part will be newly made. In chemistry, this is called "synthesis". 
There are three different way this replication could happen:

Mendelson and Stahl concluded that DNA employs semi-conservative replication. They placed the bacteria in an environment which contained a selected Nitrogen isotope. They first used N. The bacteria then integrated this isotope into their DNA. Later they used an environment that contained N. They then looked at which of the isotopes the bacterial DNA contained. They found that it contained both isotopes of nitrogen, which implies that conservative replication is not the correct conclusion. By having a closer look they could then also rule out disperse replication. Some helix strands were all N. Other helix strands from the time in the N environment had N.

Woodford tube station

Woodford is a London Underground station in Woodford in the London Borough of Redbridge, United Kingdom.

The station is on the Central Line between South Woodford and Buckhurst Hill. The station is also a terminus (an ending point) for services from Hainault via Chigwell.

The station was opened on 22 August 1856 as part of the Eastern Counties Railway branch to Loughton. It was changed by the successor company, the Great Eastern Railway, to include services to Ilford via the Fairlop Loop that was opened in 1903. After 1923 the station came under the control of the London & North Eastern Railway until it was given to the London Passenger Transport Board (LT) on 14 December 1947 as part of the extension of the Central Line services of the London Underground. The station was a terminus for the Central Line, with passengers transferring to a steam shuttle towards Epping, until electric services began as far as Loughton (and around the 'loop' to Hainault) on 21 November 1948.

Joan Waste

Joan Waste (1534 - 1 August 1556) was a blind woman who was burned in Derby because she would not stop being a Protestant. She had bought a Bible so that friends could read to her.

Waste was blind when she was born in 1534. Her parents were William and Joan Waste. William's job was to cut people's hair and make rope. By the age of twelve, Joan had learned to make ropes and clothes. 

In 1553, Queen Mary came to the throne and it was made illegal to hold Protestant views. Mary condemned 277 people for not having the right sort of religion. This crime was called heresy.
Joan Waste was taken to court for breaking the law. The judge was a man employed by the bishop. She had to defend her views and was told she would die.. She had not liked the fact that the church services were being read in the language of Latin. She was to die for being a Protestant and for refusing to agree with the Catholic church. She bought a Bible in English, but the Catholic Church wanted them to only be in Latin. She asked friends to read to her for a penny. 

On the day of her death she walked arm-in-arm with her twin brother to be burned.

Her death took place at the Windmill Pit on the Burton Road in Derby. She was hanged over the fire with a rope. She fell into the fire when the rope burned through. The judge was Antony Draycot. He went home to his meal.

The place where Joan Waste was killed is now the site of a church. When Elizabeth I of England became queen in 1559 she removed Ralph Baines from the job of Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. Baines was sent to be a prisoner of the Bishop of London. The judge was also sent to be a prisoner. He died after being released in 1571.

Emergency telephone

An emergency telephone is a special telephone that can be used in an emergency situation. Such telephones can usually be found on highways, and other big roads. They can also be found in places where people feel unsafe, such as big parks or the campuses of universities. Emergency telephones are also placed at spots where many people commit suicide, like bridges or cliffs. 

Emergency phones are usually connected directly, there is no need to dial a telephone number. Lifting the receiver, or pushing a button will make the call. Very often emergency telephones will also tell the other side where they are. This is because people may not know where they are or they may be in shock because of an accident that just happened.

There are many special rules that apply to emergency telephones. They need to be in special colors, because color-blind people may not be able to tell the difference between certain colors. They also need to be easy to use. In an emergency situation, many people do not have time to think about how to operate them.

Arena da Baixada

The Arena da Baixada is a football stadium and an indoor arena in Água Verde neighborhood, Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil. It has a maximum seating capacity of 28,327 people. It is formerly known as Estádio Joaquim Américo Guimarães. It was named Kyocera Arena for a short period of time (beginning 2005 until April 1, 2008). The stadium opened on June 6, 1914. The stadium is owned by Clube Atlético Paranaense. Its formal name honors Joaquim Américo Guimarães, a former chairman of Internacional-PR, which was a football club that merged with América-PR. This merger formed Atlético Paranaense. Joaquim Américo Guimarães started the stadium's construction in 1912. Despite being called an arena, it is technically an outdoor stadium. On May 31 2009, the stadium was made one of the match sites for the Brazil 2014 World Cup . The Stadium is expanding in order to host over 40,000 people during the event.

The stadium was built at the previous location of a Brazilian Army powder depot. In 1934, the stadium was renamed Estádio Joaquim Américo Guimarães. In the 1970s, the original stadium was closed down. After being reopened in 1984 and operating for some years, the old stadium building was demolished on March 26, 1997, right after a construction project of a new arena was announced. In June 1999, the new stadium was built. In 2005, the stadium was renamed "Kyocera Arena", after the Japanese company Kyocera purchased the naming rights.

The inaugural match of the old stadium was played on September 6, 1914, when Flamengo beat Internacional 7–1. The first goal of the stadium was scored by Flamengo's Arnaldo.

The inaugural match of the new building was played on June 24, 1999, when Atlético Paranaense beat Cerro Porteño of Paraguay 2–1. The first goal of the stadium after its reinauguration was scored by Atlético's Lucas.

The stadium's attendance record currently stands at 31,740. It was set on December 16, 2001 when Atlético Paranaense beat São Caetano 4–2, on the first game of that year's Brazilian Championship finals.

Though the present stadium is still new, there are some plans for newer stadiums for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

The contract with Kyocera that gave the company naming rights expired in early 2008. It was not renewed, and no new partnership was announced. The stadium went back to its old name, "Arena da Baixada".

Steller's sea cow ("Hydrodamalis gigas") is a extinct mammal are member of the order Sirenia (today consisting of dugongs and manatees) discovered in 1741. They weighed approximately 10 tonnes, fed on kelp, and lived in shallow waters around the Bering Sea. Hunted relentlessly for their meat, they died out within 27 years of their discovery. The reduction in their kelp food supply may also have contributed to their extinction.

Bilal ibn Ribah

Bilal ibn Ribah(578-638) was one of the companions of Muhammad. Bilal was an Ethiopian black slave.

Bilal ibn Rabah (Arabic: بلال بن رباح‎) or Bilal al-Habashi was an Ethiopian born in Mecca in the late 6th century, sometime between 578 and 582.Bilal was an Ethiopian slave. Bilal's owner was Umayyah ibn Khalaf, an enemy of Islam. When Bilal learned about Muhammad and became Muslim, his master started punishing him. When Muhammad heard about this, he ordered Abu Bakr to buy Bilal's freedom and Bilal -who was now free- joined Muhammad's companions.

Muhammad choose Bilal as the first muezzin. A muezzin is someone who leads the call to daily prayer. Sometimes Bilal walked the streets to call Muslims to come to prayer but most of the times, he said the Adhan from the top of the mosque.

Some years later, when the Muslim army walked towards Mecca, everyone ran to their homes and closed all doors and windows. They were afraid that the Muslims were going to kill them, because of the bad things they did to the Muslims many years ago. But, the Muslims went towards the Kaaba, the worship house believed to be built by Abraham and his elder son, Ishmael. Bilal, shouted out loud to the people of Mecca that they were all safe: "All those who lay down arms are safe. All those in the house of Abu Sufyan are safe. All those behind closed doors are safe."
After Muhammad died, Bilal never said the Adhan again - except on two occasions. Once in Syria and the second time, in Medina, when Muhammad's grandson, Hasan ibn Ali asked him to do so.

Bilal died in Damascus between 638 and 642 (AD).

Hadith books are the collections of Muhammad's sayings.

Muhammad used to say about Bilal:

When Bilal was chosen as the Muezzin, some people complained to Muhammad. They believed only an Arab can be a Muezzin, because Bilal could not pronounce the Arabic words correctly and he used to pronounce "s" instead of "sh". When Muhammad heard their complaint, he said:

Deputy

A Deputy is a person who helps someone do their job when they are not there. "Deputy" is a rank or title. It usually refers to someone who is "second-in-command". For example: a "Deputy Master" is someone who will take over the responsibilities of the Master when the Master is not there. A "deputy conductor" will conduct an orchestra when the main (principal) conductor is not there. It is similar to an "assistant". Someone who is working as a deputy will deputize (stand in for someone else).

Sometimes other terms are used such as "vice". A vice-president will take over the responsibilities of the president when he (or she) is not there or is ill.

André Previn

André Previn (born 6 April, 1929, Berlin, Germany) is an American conductor, pianist and composer of German birth. 

André Previn was born as Andreas Ludwig Priwin to a Jewish family in Berlin, Germany. He may have been born in 1930, but cannot be sure as his birth certificate was lost when he emigrated to the United States with his family in 1939 to escape the Nazis. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1943.

When he arrived in America he lived in Los Angeles. He started to be well-known by composing film scores for Hollywood films. 

In 1967, Previn became conductor of the Houston Symphony Orchestra and in 1968 conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. He stayed with the LSO for eleven years. His television series "André Previn's Music Night" helped to make classical music popular in Britain. From 1976 to 1984, Previn was conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO), with whom he made another television series called "Previn and the Pittsburgh". He was also principal conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. 

In 1985 he became conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, but because of disagreements he resigned in 1989.

Previn has made many recordings and composed many film scores and other musical works. He has also toured and recorded as a jazz pianist. More recently he has concentrated on composing classical music.

Previn has received many prizes and honours. In the United Kingdom he was knighted in 1996. He is particularly remembered in Britain for a guest appearance he made on the Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show in 1971 where Eric Morecambe (who called him Andrew Preview) pretended to play the Piano Concerto by Edvard Grieg with Previn conducting. When Previn told him he was playing all the wrong notes, Morecambe grabbed him by his jacket and said that he was playing "all the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order".

Andre Previn has been married five times. His fifth marriage was to the German violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter for whom he wrote a violin concerto. They divorced in 2006.

MesseTurm is a skyscraper in Frankfurt am Main, Hesse, Germany. In English it is known as the "Fair Tower". It is Germany's second tallest, and at the time of its building, it was the tallest building in Europe. It is the fourth tallest building in Europe. It is 257 metres (840 feet) tall.

MesseTurm is located in Frankfurt's district "Westend". This is near the same named Trade Fair-Area in the centre of the city. It is home to the German headquarters of Reuters, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse.

The construction began in 1988. It was finished in 1991. It was the tallest building in Europe, between 1991 and 1997. In 1997, Commerzbank Tower became the tallest building in Germany. It was only two metres higher than MesseTurm. The construction of the building's foundation set a world record. The world record was for the longest continuous concrete pour. Ninety trucks poured concrete for 78 hours. They poured it into the deep foundation.

There is a pyramid on the very top of MesseTurm. It is tall. This makes it very different from other skyscrapers. Because of this shape, people in Germany often call it "The Pencil."

I'm really confused. I found an article called Peter Pan with some comments about being gay and Michael Jackson etc etc. I changed it to be more correct and a bot arrived and changed it back to the silly version. And gave me a warning for vandalism!! Help please? () 17:12, 16 May 2009 (UTC)

I'd unintentionally posted to an archived discussion regarding this little menace, so I thought I'd do it right. :) He was just booted off of English yet again and I have to tell you, I am sick to death of this individual. English has a long-term vandal of nearly five years nicknamed "MascotGuy." His idiosyncracies point toward autism. He's generally benign, but a pain nonetheless. Bambifan101, on the other hand, may be in serious need of professional help if he's for real. I remember when I was 14 and you can bet your bottom dollar that I wouldn't have been writing about the Teletubbies on a wiki site if either had been around at the time. Nor would I keep coming back to a place I wasn't wanted. I take hints well. This screwball does not. Most of his anon edits resolve back to Bell South in Atlanta. What are the steps to be taken for a formal complaint to the IP for TOS violations and abuse? -- () 20:14, 17 May 2009 (UTC)


I'm not a doctor either, but I don't believe it takes one to see that we're dealing with a really bizarre individual. If he is in fact a fourteen-year-old boy, his interests/obsessions/tantrums point to a mental age less than half that in my opinion. He just happens to be good with computers or he has someone who knows how to shift proxies enabling him. The other likely scenario is that we're dealing with a fully aware adolescent troll who's getting his yuks whenever he logs on and pretends to be this person. I'm an administrator at English and I have to deal with him all the time. I may have frightened him off to some degree and he's coming here instead. Sadly, you may be right about doing all you can. If his proxies keep shifting and he's obsessed with editing these sites, there really isn't much either of us can do beyond playing "Whack-A-Bambi." In the meantime, I'm working on building my edit count here so that I can apply for adminship and help out. Good luck and I'll keep on patrolling for him over here. -- () 17:07, 18 May 2009 (UTC)

Hello, this is probably my last post before wikibreak, but I want you to think about something while I am not here:
All I want to do is that if someone long-term blocks a user, the knowledge about the specifics is not lost whe n the admin leaves (read: 6 months from now, you want some specific info on a block, but you cant find it because it's no longer in the logs, and the blocking admin left?)

Anyway, I'll leave you to ponder...-- () 00:38, 28 May 2009 (UTC)

Single-topic editor; claims to be the author of a "definitive book on Badfinger", but has never made a single edit to the Badfinger article. Instead he makes multiple reverts to the Peter Ham article, to his own last-year's version laden with POV and not written in Simple English. Every footnote references the same, online version of said book. (The [1]s throughout the piece get truly monotonous.) His explanation for this is that "since it's an online version, there are no page numbers" to be cited.

BG7 has sadly left Simple; let's just forget this drama and go back to editing. 19:47, 4 July 2009 (UTC)

Bluegoblin is attempting to host discussion regarding our DYK process on his talk page . I have asked him to not do that here and he responds that no one reads that page. This is unacceptable, talk of process should go on that process page. We don't discuss project changes on low vis talk pages.
Regarding his bold edits... he prefers to filibuster and edit war before discussing his bold edits... requiring consensus for everything.

I don't really like the personalising and owning of DYK. 

I also deleted the sandbox this morning to test out a restore feature I was scripting, but did not get a chance to because he restored it without talking to me, or letting me know.

Now this is a good editor. The actions need to be reviewed, they are getting a bit out of hand. 

These actions are detrimental to project collaboration and I want it stopped. So I bring here for discussion. () 16:54, 4 July 2009 (UTC)

Also, there are two recent incidents also to the pattern of disruption I should also bring up. 



Given that and the above, I am considering BG please reconsider his actions, he is a sysop on this project and the actions should reflect that. () 18:05, 4 July 2009 (UTC)

Please review my block. and unblock if I made a mistake. Thanks, () 18:18, 4 July 2009 (UTC)

I propose the de-sysopping of the above administrator for abuse of the Block tool.

As i'm sure you aware, he blocked me for "Disruption" for two hours when I did not use the flood flag due to the discussion about my editing above. This block is very clearly not what blocks are for - prevention of damage to the encyclopedia - as I was clearly not damaging it. There were no edits before, during or after my supposed "flood", so I see this as a very POINT-y block... and was that not why I was blocked? Hypocritical, no?

Simple really needs to sort itself out if it goes round blocking users for following the rules. Where is there a rule that says that the flag has to be used, anyway? Show me one and i'll back off :).

Seeing that the community has questions with BG7's "non-controversial" reinstatement and based on drama that happened over at AN a while before the desysop request on Meta, an RfA is required to regain the tools.     11:09, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

Hello all, I would like to request my admin tools back following my resignation. I've taken time to think over the events, and will be releasing a statement on my userpage within the next day or so, as well as contacting all involved parties if I haven't yet done so. Furthermore, i'll be proposing a few things on wiki to try and stop such events occuring again.

If anyone objects to this, please comment below. Let me also make it clear that for various off-wiki reasons i'll also be less active in discussions and the like and more active in article work, article improvement programmes and vandal fighting etc. The various bots will also be back online if there are no objections.

Kind regards,



Concerns for the automatic re-grant of the tools are risen up. I think we can stop now to discuss useless.
Strong support This is not up to the community or admins to decide. It is for the 'crats to decide. Bluegoblin7 resigned his flag without being asked to and without it being called for by a community desysoping. It is therefore his right to ask for them back. I disagree that his resignation was "under a cloud", only his actions were and a desysoping did not take place. In any event, it is up to the crats, not the community to decide this case. Regards 18:25, 9 July 2009 (UTC)



I think the crat's role is being misinterpreted. They decide the result of an RFA. It isn't up to bcrats to decide if tools were abused or if someone resigned in good standing. I think BG7 should go through an RFA again. It was fairly clear he resigned under a cloud. And there is a considerable voice against his promotion with valid reasons. A bcrat ignoring concerns like that would not be a very good bureaucrat. 19:16, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

There is a big difference between someone who decides to step down after a long personal deliberation and someone who sends a heated request to meta with "RTV". Personally, the latter user is not entitled to request adminship is automatically reinstated without a community review. If the above comments said something like "Oh, I understand, we all have a hard time sometimes", then perhaps. But, quite a few users have expressed concerns over BG's actions in the past. Ultimately, the question of whether to reinstate BG comes down to one questions: 1) Does the user have the community's trust and support to exercise the role appropriately? I think the only way to find out is to ask (whether it's an RfA, desysop, or some other method, such as this discussion). 20:07, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

Hurricane Ike was the third most damaging storm in United States (U.S.) history, having caused about $24 billion dollars in damage, it was only behind Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 as the most damaging in the U.S.. Hurricane Ike was the ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane and the strongest hurricane of 2008. Ike may have caused up to 195 deaths. Most deaths happened in Haiti and the U.S. Haiti was still recovering from Tropical Storm Fay, Hurricane Gustav, and Hurricane Hanna. 

The storm that eventually became Hurricane Ike started near the west coast of Africa on August 28. The storm grew quickly as it moved to the west-northwest. On September 1, the storm formed into Tropical Depression Nine when the storm was over the central Atlantic Ocean. Later that day Tropical Depression Nine became Tropical Storm Ike.

In spring 2009, the name "Ike" was retired due to the severe damage it caused. It was replaced for the name "Isaias" in 2014 list of names.

Rafflesia

Rafflesia are the biggest flowers in the world. The flowers can be one meter (three feet) across. The flower smells like a dead animal. The smell attracts flies. Bright spots in the flower attract the flies to come inside. The flies pollinate the Rafflesia.

Rafflesia is a parasite. A parasite depends on another living thing called a host. A parasite takes from the host and harms the host. A parasite gives nothing back. Green plants use chlorophyll to make their own food from air, water, and sunlight. Parasitic plants like Rafflesia are not green.

Rafflesia has no leaves, no stems, and no roots. The only part of Rafflesia that can be seen is the flower. The rest of the plant is a network of threads inside roots of the host plant. They take their food from host plants that are green. The host plants of Rafflesia are vines that grow in the rainforests of Southeast Asia.

<doc id="184942" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=184942" title="Granulating method">
Granulating method

Granulating methods are necessary when the specific surface of fine powders has to be decreased, and its bulk density increased. This will reduce the problems of charging in the loading of the equipment, so that the flow characteristics and accuracy during the pressing of tablets (for example) improve. Solids with low bulk weights are usually heavily ventilated, leading to a strong dust nuisance in the workplace. In addition, segregation of heterogeneous composites is avoided by granulating materials with different average particle sizes that are to be processed together. Fixing of the different particles to each other allows a further processing without significant loss of uniformity with regard to the composition.

There are wet and dry granulating methods.

Wet granulating methods use a binder or adhesive and a solvent. 

Dry granulating methods produce so-called foreign material free compact granulate by applying a compacting pressure.

Roller compacting agglomerates the starting material, followed by crushing to granules. Dry granulating methods produce foreign material free compact granulate by applying a compacting pressure. Depending on the material, the device parameters and equipment, larger or smaller slab segments are produced. These slabs are further processed to produce the actual pellet. Some manufacturers combine the process of roller compacting and the subsequent shredding by a granulating unit in one device. 
These devices are, strictly speaking, compacting - granulators.

General advantages of roller compacting 

The dry granulating technology of roller compacting is an efficient and economically advantageous granulating method, due to the absence of water and solvents, and making it suitable for moisture-sensitive substances. This affects the cost-benefit balance positively.

Thomas Beecham

Sir Thomas Beecham (born St Helens, Lancashire, 29 April 1879; died London, 8 March 1961) was an English conductor. He was one of the most famous conductors of his time. He came from a very rich family and was able to use his money to pay orchestras that he formed. He formed the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He was especially well-known for conducting the music of Mozart as well as that of his friend Delius. 

He often made funny jokes and many amusing stories are told about things that he said.

Beecham was born in 1879 in St. Helens, Lancashire in the north of England. Beecham was self-taught as a conductor. He had some private composition lessons from Charles Wood in London and Moszkowski in Paris. Beecham’s father, Sir Joseph Beecham, had made a lot of money making medicines (the famous Beecham pills) and he also liked music, so he was able to help his son in his career as a musician. 

Thomas was only 20 years old when his father was reinstated as mayor of St. Helens. To celebrate this, his father paid for the Hallé Orchestra to give a concert. It was going to be conducted by the famous German conductor Hans Richter. However, a few days before the concert it was announced that Richter was ill. Thomas immediately said he would conduct the concert. The orchestra at first refused to play for a 20 year old who had only once ever conducted a concert, but in the end they changed their minds and the concert was a great success.

In 1909 Thomas got a group of musicians together to form the Beecham Symphony Orchestra. They gave concerts and played for ballets and operas. Beecham conducted operas in Covent Garden and other London opera houses. He conducted works by composers suc as Strauss, Delius, Smythe and Holbrooke. He also played for Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes when they first came to England.

During World War I he gave money to the Halle Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Society, all of which he conducted. He often conducted these orchestras outside London, giving people opportunity to hear music they had never heard before.

For several years he had financial problems and did not conduct much. Then, in 1932, he formed the London Philharmonic Orchestra and quickly made it into an excellent orchestra. They toured Germany in 1936 and the next year went to Paris. During the 1930s he conducted at Covent Garden where he had control of everything that went on. He conducted several cycles of Wagner’s Ring. When World War II started in 1939 the theatre was closed. He went to the United States where he conducted several orchestras including the New York Philharmonic. He also went to Australia.

In 1944 he returned to Britain. His orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, were now a self-governing body (the members themselves made decisions about what the orchestra should do and play). They decided that they did not want Beecham because he would want to have power to rule the orchestra in the way he wanted. So Beecham formed another orchestra: the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He gave many concerts, toured with them and made many great recordings. He was especially known for his concerts of Joseph Haydn and Mozart. He also conducted Die Meistersinger at Covent Garden in 1951 as well as appearing at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires in 1958. The last concert he gave was on 7 May 1960 when he conducted the RPO in Portsmouth.

Beecham was an enormously talented musician. Because he had a lot of money he did not need to go through the musical education that most other musicians have. He formed his own life, and spent a lot of his energy as well as money creating the right conditions for musicians to work in, conditions that would have been normal in many other European countries, but which were not normal at the time in England.

He was not interested in the music of Bach, though he did conduct Handel. He was famous for his Mozart performances, and particularly enjoyed playing Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Bizet and Dvořák. He was one of the first people in England to conduct the new music of Richard Strauss and Sibelius. He was a close friend of Delius and performed his music as well as editing it so that it could be published.

There are many stories about the witty things that he said. He was knighted in 1916.

A lady told Beecham that she wanted her son to learn to play a musical instrument but did not want to hear the awful sound it made when he was beginning to learn. She asked him what instrument he should learn. Beecham said he should learn the bagpipes because “they sound exactly the same when you have finished learning them as when you start learning them”.

Beecham was rehearsing a very long opera by Wagner. They had been rehearsing for a long time. Beecham took out his watch and said: “My God! We have been playing for two hours and we are still playing this bloody tune!”

Beecham was rehearsing an opera by an English composer. The composer was at the rehearsal, and kept stopping the orchestra and asking Beecham to play it differently. Each time Beecham turned back to the orchestra and said: “The same again, gentlemen, please”.

Beecham once met a lady he knew, but could not remember who she was. He asked her whether she was well.

The Real Ghostbusters

The Real Ghostbusters is an American animated television series based on the 1984 film "Ghostbusters". The series ran from 1986 to 1991, and was produced by Columbia Pictures Television (now Sony Pictures Television), DiC Entertainment and Coca-Cola. "The Real" was added to the title over a dispute with Filmation and its Ghost Busters properties. The series continues the adventures of paranormal investigators Dr. Peter Venkman, Dr. Egon Spengler, Winston Zeddemore, Dr. Ray Stantz, their secretary Janine Melnitz and their mascot ghost Slimer.


The show originally aired on ABC for its full run, except for the third season which ran on syndication at the same time as the second season ran on ABC. Later, reruns of the show appeared on USA Network, Fox Family before moving to Nickelodeon from 1996 to 1999 and on Cartoon Network in 2002. Teletoon aired episodes of the series in the month of October beginning in 1998, but has not done so in recent years.
At the start of the third season in 1988, with the series renaming, it was given an hour long time slot. In addition to the regular thirty-minute "Real Ghostbusters" episode, a half-hour "Slimer" sub-series was added that included 2-3 short animated segments focusing on the character Slimer. At the end of its six season run, 147 episodes had aired, including the syndicated episodes and 13 episodes of "Slimer", with multiple episodes airing out of production order. The segments added several characters as friends of Slimer, including the character Professor Norman Dweeb—mad scientist accompanied by a poodle named Elizabeth who wanted to capture Slimer to experiment on him. The Professor Dweeb also made infrequent appearances in the main series. One of the ghosts from the "Slimer" cartoons, the Sleaze, also reappeared in "The Real Ghostbusters" to be captured a second time.

In 1997, a sequel cartoon entitled "Extreme Ghostbusters", was created by Columbia TriStar Television and Adelaide Productions. It premiered on September 1, 1997 and ran for forty episodes until its conclusion on December 8, 1997. Set several years after the end of "The Real Ghostbusters", the series opened by saying the team has disbanded due to a lack of supernatural activity. Only Egon remains in the firehouse, along with Slimer, to care for the containment system and teaching classes at a local university. When supernatural events begin occurring in New York, Egon recruits four of his university students as a new team of Ghostbusters, and Janine, also one of Egon's students, returns to manage the office. The original Ghostbusters return for the series two-episode finale to celebrate Egon's 40th birthday, leading to them reluctantly working together with the younger generation to solve one last case.

Malcolm Sargent

Sir Malcolm Sargent (born Ashford, Kent, 29 April 1895; died London 3 October 1967) was an English conductor, organist and composer. He was an extremely famous and popular conductor who had a lot of influence on music in England during his life. He conducted many choirs, both amateur and professional, as well as orchestras. He was the main conductor of the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts from 1948 to 1967. He made the Last Night of the Proms into a very popular and joyful concert which today is enjoyed by millions of people worldwide on television. He conducted the music of many British composers, helping them to become known to a wide public.

Sargent was born in 1895 into a working-class family. His father was a coal merchant at Stamford, Lincolnshire, who also played the organ. Sargent grew up in Stamford and became involved in a lot of amateur music making. He learned a lot about music from singing in church and playing the organ. He took his ARCO organ diploma when he was only 16 and became an organ pupil at Peterborough Cathedral. At 18 he got a job as organist at Melton Mowbray church. In the same year he got a music degree from the University of Durham.

After conducting local choirs and orchestras he got the opportunity to conduct his own composition "Impressions on a Windy Day" with Henry Wood’s Queen’s Hall Orchestra, first at Leicester and then at the Proms in the Queen's Hall. Wood encouraged him in his conducting. He started to teach at the Royal College of Music and moved to London. He conducted the Robert Mayer children’s concerts and the Courtauld-Sargent concerts, a series which was aimed at people who had never been to concerts. He conducted for Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes and, in 1928 he became conductor of the Royal Choral Society, a job which he kept until his death.

In 1932 he was very ill with tuberculosis, but he recovered during the next few years. He often conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra which had been formed in 1932 by Thomas Beecham. He did not often conduct opera, but he did conduct at the Royal Opera House: in 1936 with Gustave Charpentier's opera "Louise" in 1936 and in 1954 the first performance of Walton's "Troilus and Cressida".

As an orchestra conductor Sargent was not always popular. He made many enemies with a remark he made in 1936 when he said that orchestral musicians should not have a secure “job for life” but should give their “lifeblood with every bar they played”. Sargent had only just recovered from a long illness himself, during which time the musicians had given him support, so they were very annoyed when he said this.

He was very popular in Australia and nearly took a job there, but when World War II started he decided he should work in his own country. During the war, Sargent conducted the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester (1939-42) and the Liverpool Philharmonic (1942-48) and became a popular radio broadcaster with the BBC. He helped the British people to keep their spirits up during the war by touring and giving many concerts and not asking for much money. During one concert he was playing Beethoven's "Symphony No. 7" when there was an air raid. Sargent stopped the orchestra, calmed the audience by saying they were safer inside the hall than they would be outside, and started to conduct again. The orchestra played extremely well that night. In May 1941 Sargent conducted Elgar's "Dream of Gerontius" in an afternoon concert in the Queen's Hall. That night the Queen’s Hall was completely destroyed by a bomb.

In 1945, Arturo Toscanini invited Sargent to conduct the NBC Symphony Orchestra. He gave four concerts, in which he included mostly British music.

Sargent was chief conductor of the Proms from 1948 until his death in 1967. In 1950 he followed Sir Adrian Boult as conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He held that job until 1957 when he became Chief Guest Conductor. Everywhere that Sargent took the orchestra the audience were wild with excitement. The orchestra became internationally famous.

Sargent was a very popular person at the Proms. He made the Last Night (the last concert of each season) into an exciting celebration in which the audience waved flags and joined together to sing, hum and clap. He conducted music by famous classical composers as well as British music by more recent composers. However, he did not conduct modern experimental music.

During his time at the Proms foreign conductors such as Carlo Maria Giulini, Georg Solti, Leopold Stokowski, Rudolf Kempe, Pierre Boulez and Bernard Haitink were invited to perform. There were also some foreign orchestras.

When the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra nearly had to come to an end after Beecham's death in 1961, Sargent worked hard to save the orchestra. A lot of the players, who still remembered the remark he made in 1936, started to support him again.

By the mid-1960s Sargent was suffering from cancer. He was too ill to conduct the Proms in 1967, but on 16 September, at the Last Night, to everyone’s astonishment, he appeared at the end of the concert to talk to his audience. He gave his baton to Colin Davis who took over his job. Sargent looked very ill, and died two weeks later.

Sargent received many honours. He was knighted in 1947 and received the Royal Philharmonic Society gold medal in 1959. His nickname was “Flash Harry” because he always dressed and behaved in a flashy style. He was often known as “Britain’s ambassador of music”, because he often toured all over the world with his orchestras, conducting British music, especially the works of Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Holst and Walton. If the professional musicians he worked with did not always like him, his audiences loved him and he was especially fond of the Promenaders. At his memorial service in Westminster Abbey the whole of the nave was reserved for Promenade Season Ticket holders

Boyce and Hart

Boyce and Hart were a musical and songwriting duo, who worked together in the 1960s and 1970s. Tommy Boyce (born Sidney Thomas Boyce in 1939 and died in 1994) and Bobby Hart (born Robert Luke Harshman in 1939) wrote and produced hit records for The Monkees ("Last Train To Clarksville", "Valleri"), Jay and the Americans ("Come A Little Bit Closer"), Chubby Checker ("Lazy Elsie Molly"), and for themselves, with "I Wonder What She's Doing Tonight" and other songs.

Their biggest success was with the Monkees, as writers, producers and performers. Many of the early Monkees recordings featured Boyce and Hart's band, the Candy Store Prophets, before the Monkees were even selected from auditions. When the Monkees themselves took charge of their recordings, they still recorded Boyce and Hart's songs, and praised the duo to the public.

Ten years after the Monkees's heyday, two former members, Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones, teamed up with Boyce and Hart, touring and performing the band's hits. They also issued a new album on Capitol Records.

<doc id="185229" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185229" title="Dino Contostavlos">
Dino Contostavlos

Costas Dinos Contostavlos, better known by his stage name of "Dappy", is an English rapper/singer of Greek heritage. He leads the hip-hop group N-Dubz. Contostavlos was raised on a Camden Town council estate, North London by his mother, Zoe Contostavlos and father, Byron Contostavlos. His father was the bassist in 1970s group Mungo Jerry.Contostavlos is from Greek origin but speaks fluent English with a classic North London accent. He does not think of himself to be "English in anyway". At home he speaks Greek. He says he is a "foreign guy that lives in Camden". He wears unusual hats. His trademark is a selection of woolly fleece lined hats with big pom-poms on the top and strings on the sides. These have been called "Dappy hats". He normally turns up one side of the hat.

Dino was born in Camden Town, London. It is said that he grew up in a small council flat with his parents and older brother. He actually lived in a large townhouse because his father was a member of the 1970s band, Mungo Jerry. In an interview he gave to The Sun, he said that the estate he lived on was "rough and lots of the kids I saw got into drugs or fights". Dino showed interest in music from a young age. He started performing around Camden Town at the age of 13 years old. He performed with band members Richard "Fazer" Rawson and Tula "Tulisa" Contostavlos, who is his cousin. At the time they were called the "Lickle Rinsers Crew". Contostavlos and his band-mates studied at Haverstock School. Contostavlos was forced to leave the school when he was 15, for multiple truancies and fighting. He later went back to study at college and received a GCSE A* in English. His father, Byron was, to Dappy, the "inspiration behind the band". With the money he made from his time in the band, Bryon set up a small studio for the band. When Byron died, the song N-Dubz wrote "Papa (Can You Hear Me?)" was played at his funeral. It became the group's best hit at #19, and at #17 in the download charts. Dino later had the words "RIP Dad" tattooed on his neck. He refers to his dad as "B" or "Uncle B". This is also the name of N-Dubz's first album.

N-Dubz were forced to change some of their live shows from the Uncle B tour after Dappy got temporary deafness. He later said that it "was terrible and it has really taught me to take better care of my ears because I wouldn't be the musician I am today if I couldn't hear."

In 2007 Dappy released "Love For My Slum" with fellow UK rap artist Baker Trouble. It was number one on Channel U for several weeks. It did not do as well with the media. It was heavily criticized for a scene in which Dappy is stood outside a block of expensive luxury flats with a "rich kid" who is trying to look like a gangster. "The Independent" wrote "His lyrics combine jealousy with anger: 'You got too much to lose / You're in a great position... You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from / You'd go missing / So appreciate what you got / 'cos I'm still wishing.' And then he grabs the rich kid by his coat, pulls him toward him, and punches him in the face. The silent boy falls instantly to the pavement...", they then went on to put "Do scenes like these suggest that music videos are encouraging their viewers to indulge in criminality?". Other newspapers put that he was "idolising thuggery". When asked in interviews about the single, and these comments he said "these people need to listen to the lyrics, they are about showing appreciation to what you've got".

In December 2008, Contostavlos pleaded guilty to two counts of assault at Chelmsford Magistrates Court, Essex. He spat in a girl's face while drunk on a night out. He got four weeks' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months and 100 hours community service. He was also ordered to pay £50 to the girl and her friend, and £300 costs.

On 29 January 2009, Contostavlos was arrested after he someone said he was saying he would kill someone while he had a gun. He said this was not true. The police searched his Camden home looking for a gun. Three days later (Saturday 31 January) he was taken off a British Airways flight from Edinburgh to London by police after it landed, with fellow N-Dubz performer Fazer, after appearing to be acting disorderly. A source said: "They were swearing at kids on the plane, being foul and threatening passengers. Cabin crew called ahead to the police, who were waiting when the plane landed. They were taken away by armed officers."

Dappy has also had many problems in the media with celebrities such as Alexandra Burke, Elly Jackson of La Roux, and Flo Rida. 

His 2008 drunken problem has caused problems in January 2010 when he applied for a visa to the United States. He has since been allowed a visa.

A cotyledon, or seed leaf, is a leaf that is stored in a seed. When the seed sprouts, the cotyledons are the first leaves that the plant has. Monocot plants have only one cotyledon, and other plants have two. Cotyledons often look very different from the other leaves, so they are not called true leaves.

Plants use cotyledons to make sugars through photosynthesis. They use the sugars to grow true leaves to keep growing. After a while, the cotyledons often die because the plant does not need them anymore.

<doc id="185297" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185297" title="Power Purchasing Agreement">
Power Purchasing Agreement

A Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) is a legal contract between a electricity provider and a land owner. The contract allows the electricity provider to produce power on the land owner's land or roof and the land owner buys the electricity primarily from the electricity provider. This deal is often done using solar technology, where the electricity provider will install, operate, and maintain solar panels on the land owner's roof. Then the land owner will buy the electricity from the solar panels on the roof. Part of the PPA is to set a price for the electrcity (often lower than the previous price the land owner was paying for power line electrcity). If the solar panels do not provide enough electricity for the land owner, then he will buy the rest of his electrcity from the power lines. If the electricity provider creates more electricity than the land owner needs, then he will sell the excess to the power lines.

Schools and government buildings often like to do power purchasing agreements because they do not have the money to install solar panals on their roof. Large department stores also like to do power purchasing agreements because they have large roofs and do not want to deal with the costs of installing and maintaining panels.

Power Purchasing agreements tend to last 5 – 20 years. At the end of the PPA, either the contract is extended, the solar panels are removed from the property, or the land owner buys the solar panels from the electricity provider.

Power Purchasing agreements have been very important to the expansion of solar electricity use in the United States. Investment tax credits from the federal and state governments have helped make the price of solar panels affordable for the providing companies. The tax credit can help pay for significant percentage of the project cost in some cases. 

Some of the electricity providers who offer PPAs are:

Vancouver, Washington

Vancouver, Washington is a United States city, just north of the Columbia River in the state of Washington. It is directly north of Portland, Oregon and south of Vancouver, British Columbia. Both cities were named for George Vancouver, a British explorer and sea captain. Vancouver, Washington, includes the old Fort Vancouver, begun by the British Hudson's Bay Company in 1824. It was made part of the United States on June 15, 1846, as part of the Oregon Treaty. It is the fourth largest city in Washington state.

The Vancouver area was home to Native Americans before the arrival of Europeans. Chinook and Klickitat tribes called this area "land of the mud turtles" before 1775. Disease killed most natives before the Hudson's Bay Company came in the 1820's. The Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Vancouver to trade in beaver skins, which were used to make top hats. Workers at Fort Vancouver came from England, the Sandwich Islands, Scotland and Canada. Many trappers had native wives and lived outside Fort Vancouver.

Americans began to arrive from the Oregon Trail. John McLoughlin was head man at Fort Vancouver and helped the Americans with tools and seed. Fort Vancouver closed in the 1840's. The city of Vancouver was incorporated in 1857 and was over three times as big by 1909. In 1917, the first bridge connecting Oregon to Washington over the Columbia River was built from Vancouver. In 1982 another bridge was built a few miles east for the I-205 freeway.

Columbia Barracks became Vancouver Barracks and was the biggest US military base in Oregon, Washington or Idaho for many years. During World War I the Vancouver Barracks had a lumber mill to cut spruce wood to make biplanes. Another ship yard built ships for World War II. Shipyard workers came and Vancouver grew from from 18,000 to over 80,000 people. Vancouver grew again and in 1997 grew again to almost its present size. About half as many people live just north of Vancouver as live inside the city. About one in three Vancouver workers have jobs in Portland, Oregon.

Vancouver is located at 45°38′1″ North, 122°36′11″ West (45.633743, −122.603011). 

Vancouver is just north of the Columbia River and west of the volcanic Cascade Range mountains and the Columbia gorge. Vancouver is about fifty miles from the Pacific Ocean, which gives it rain. Because it is in a valley between the Pacific Coast and Cascade mountains, there are clouds in winter. When it is clear one can see Mount Hood, the Mount Saint Helens volcano and Mount Adams from Vancouver.

Vancouver is north of Portland, Oregon and shares a similar climate: wet from November through June and dry from July through October. Vancouver has snow once or twice a year, on average. Vancouver has a total area of . Abuout 7% is water, including Vancouver Lake to the west.

The National Register of Historic Places says that Vancouver is a good place to visit. Because it is the oldest city in the area, Vancouver has a wide variety of buildings, including:


Fort Vancouver National Historic Site also has many structures, rebuilt as they were in the 1830's.

<doc id="185435" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185435" title="Radiant heating">
Radiant heating

Radiant heating occurs when a hot surface warms other objects around it. Radiant heating has a long history of use in buildings by the Romans and the Koreans, and is much more efficient than standard ways of heating the air in a building. Underfloor radiant heating is the most common type of radiant heating used in buildings, but wall and overhead radiant heating systems are also used. Radiant heating can also be used to heat outdoor areas. 

The Romans were the first people to use underfloor radiant heating systems. These systems were based on hypocausts, and used warm air for heat. The floor was set on top of many brick piles, leaving room for the hot air and steam produced by a furnace to pass underneath the floor. The hot air then went up chimneys on the sides of the walls, so the hot air and steam never actually went into the living rooms. These systems were very expensive to build and maintain, so only the wealthy could afford them. 

In Korea, radiant underfloor heating has been in use for about 2000 years. Ondol, which means "warm stone," involves the use of stones and underground ducts to help transport warm air from the kitchen to the rooms in the house. Most homes and buildings in Korea still use ondol, although they now use hot water and electric systems. The American architect Frank Lloyd Wright discovered ondol in the early 1900s and used it in many of his building designs. Wright also invented hot water underfloor systems. 

The most common kind of radiant heating is underfloor heating. There are three types of underfloor heating: hot air systems, hot water systems and electric systems. 

Hot air systems use hot air to heat the floor, similar to the Romans' systems. However, air does not hold heat very well, and these systems aren't recommended for residential use. 

Hot water systems are the most popular and cost-effective systems for cold climates. In this type of system, water is heated by a boiler and pumped through pipes laid underneath the floor. Hot water systems can also be combined with solar thermal energy to make them more environmentally friendly. Solar thermal energy uses sunlight to heat water, which can then be used in the underfloor heating system. 

Hot water systems can also be run in reverse by running cold water through the pipes to cool the building. However, this technology is difficult to use properly and can result in condensation on the floor, which can ruin hardwood floors or rugs and make people more likely to fall.

Electric systems are made of electric cables that are laid underneath the floor. Electricity is then used to heat the cables, and this type of system can be turned on or off much faster than a hot water system. However, these systems are often more expensive than hot water systems because of the high prices of electricity, especially if the hot water system includes the use of solar thermal energy. The high cost of an electric heating system can be reduced if the floor can be set to heat during non-peak hours, such as late at night, and is left turned off during the day. Electric systems are also less environmentally friendly because electricity is usually produced by burning fossil fuels, which increases carbon emissions.

Underfloor radiant heating systems can be installed as either wet or dry systems. Wet systems are laid down and then concrete is poured over them. Concrete floors hold heat very well, but can take a long time to absorb the heat. Dry systems run in open air space between the foundation and the floor, but can be less efficient because they have to heat the air too. However, dry systems are much easier to reach if the system breaks or leaks. 

Any kind of flooring can be used with underfloor heating, but ceramic tiles are the most popular floor material because they transfer and store heat well. Materials like wood, carpet, or linoleum tile decrease the heat transfer from the underfloor system and the system must be set at a higher temperature if any of these materials are used.

Wall and overhead radiant heating systems are usually made of aluminum panels hung on the walls or ceiling. Like underfloor radiant heating, these panels can be heated by either hot water or electricity. However, panels heated by hot water often leak, so electric panels are the most common. These panels can't heat as much area as an underfloor system, but they can be quickly turned on and off when a person enters or leaves the room. Electric panels can reduce energy costs if panels are left turned off in empty rooms.

Using radiant heating outdoors is much more practical than heating air because the air is always moving outside. Outdoor radiant heaters are almost always electric devices, and usually portable, although it is possible to have underfloor radiant heating installed under a patio.

Top Gear

Top Gear is a television show on the BBC. The show is all about cars and other vehicles. They test new cars to see how fast they go. They also test really old cars and do crazy stuff with them. They usually rate cars that the normal person wouldn't be able to afford. The show started as a regular car show but has changed over time to what it is now. It uses comedy to attract viewers which are now estimated to be 350 million.
The show often has long distance races. They usually race a fast car against a different form of transportation like trains and boats. They are called 'epic' races.
They also have smaller races where they match up cars of different times to see which one outperforms the other.
The challenge part of the show is about different stunts of the most ridiculous things the show can come up with. One time they jumped a bus over a row of motorcycles (instead of the motorcycle jumping over buses).
Recently, the show has started using the phrase "How hard can it be?" for the challenge segment. They put themselves in different situations that a normal person probably wouldn't get a chance to experience.

Once during every episode (except some specials) they bring a celebrity on stage. They show footage of the celebrity driving an average car around a racetrack. They put the time it took for them to complete a lap of the track on a board with the names of all of the other celebrities who drove the same course.

Power laps are one lap around the Top Gear Test Track. They will take any car that can drive and will see how fast it can make it around the track. The vehicles must be cars and they must be road legal.

Backpacking

Backpacking is the word for hiking in the outdoors with a backpack full of all your food, clothing, water, and shelter. Usually, backpackers hike in groups to stay safer and must think to bring First Aid supplies, sleeping bags, tents, rain gear, stoves, and food. Backpacking may be done on short or long trips. Sometimes, backpacking groups begin at a trail head with a parking lot and hike over a weekend until they work their way back to the vehicle. On longer trips, groups may settle in at a base camp and hike for weeks or even months if they are more experienced and prepared. When following certain rules, backpackers have the chance to leave the outdoors better than they found them. There are certain practices such as Leave No Trace that teach backpackers and hikers to pack out all trash and help conserve nature in every way possible such as not building fires in dry areas, saving water, and protecting the environment. When backpackers use these skills, they help preserve the beauty of nature while getting to explore themselves while outside the influence of the rest of the world.

The Schulze method is a way of voting that is used to fill a single position in an election. It was developed in 1997 by Markus Schulze. It is also known as Schwartz Sequential Dropping (SSD), Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping (CSSD), Beatpath Method, Beatpath Winner, Path Voting, and Path Winner. It is used by several organizations including Wikimedia, Debian, Gentoo, and KDE.

Voters the candidates in the order from the one that they most want to win to the one they least want to win. The same preference (how much voters the candidate to win or lose) can be given to more than one candidate, and candidates can be given no number (they are interpreted as the worst).

Next, for every pair of two candidates, the two are compared: ignoring all other candidates, which of the two in the pair is preferred by most voters? How many voters agree with the majority decision is noted.

More calculations take place. Given two candidates A and K, A is said to beat K with strength "t" if "t" voters prefer A to B, "t" voters prefer B to C, and so on, and "t" voters prefer J to K. The winner W is the one such that for every other candidate X, there is a "t" so that W beats X with strength "t", but X does not beat W with strength "t".

The Man from Earth is a 2007 movie written by Jerome Bixby.

The movie tells the story of John Oldman. All of the movie takes place in a small house and its porch, where Oldman tells his friends that he is a 14,000 year old Cro-Magnon caveman.

The movie begins with the protagonist John Oldman packing up his belongings onto his truck. John Oldman is getting ready to move to a different place to live. This is when his friends come over to give him a farewell party. From their conversations it becomes evident that John Oldman and his friends are all professors in a university. After a bit of conversation, the group of friends moves into John Oldman’s house. John’s friends keep asking why he decided to “run off” so quickly. John Oldman does not answer clearly at first, but gradually becomes drawn to telling his friends what is really on his mind. He begins to tell his friends about who he really is, a 14,000 year old Cro-Magnon caveman who has survived until the present. His friends aren’t convinced, but rather constantly question John Oldman in order to prove him wrong. The talk goes on as John Oldman’s friends try to prove him wrong, in biological, historical, and religious terms. 

The conversations are driven by John Oldman’s claims of his past. His claims include the following:

But through a Mongolian who contacted Islamic culture did this kind of alcoholic beverage and the distillation techniques of making such a drink come about to the East.
As soju became prevalent throughout Won Dynasty of China, it eventually spread throughout Korea Kingdom, where it became so popular that numerous kinds of soju were created. Because soju created at that time were made from pure grains, it was very tasty and clean. It was also not so strong. However, it was very expensive simply because it was distilled.

Nowadays, soju is very popular in South Korea. Koreans enjoy drinking soju as a means of promoting friendship and getting closer to each other. Usually, people drink it with "anju", a side dish, so as to moderate its bitterness.

Jolbon was the capital city founded by Jumong.

The birth myth of the nation is that Jumong was born out of an egg and brought up by King Gumwa(금와왕) of East Buyeo(동부여). The name, Jumong, means a person good at archery. As the name shows, he was good at archery and because of his ability, Prince Daeso(대소왕자) envied him. So, Jumong felt death threats and decided to escape from East Buyeo with three friends of his. He went to Jolbon Buyeo(졸본부여) and married Sosuno(소서노) who was the princess of the nation. Jumong succeeded to the king and changed the nation's name to Goguryeo after his surname.

Since the first king, King Dongmyeong(동명성왕), Goguryeo had been invated by several woes such as Han Dynasty), and Xianbei. But, by 11th king's ruling, Gogurye had succeeded in taking control over Liaoong). Until the 24th king's period, it had had its prime time, expanding the range of the nation and driving away all the attacks from ouside. The famous king, King Gwanggaeto the Great(광개토대왕), was between the periods.

However, when it was under the control of 27th king, Youngryou(영류왕), Goguryeo acted likt it submitted to Tang Dynasty, so the king was killed by Yoen Gaesomoon(연개소문) and the new king, Bojang,(보장왕) succeeded. After Yoen Gaesomoon died, the people did not cooperate with the nation well and while its control got weak, it was annihilated by the allied forces of Silla(신라) and Tang.

Overcharge

Overcharge is an economic term used in legal discourse about price fixing violations. An overcharge is the difference between what a buyer or seller "actually" paid for a good purchased from a cartel and what the buyer or seller "would have" paid in the absence of a price-fixing cartel. The total amount of the overcharges paid by customers of a cartel is the major component of damages that can be recovered by plaintiffs in private antitrust suits. Under U.S. federal antitrust law, buyers injured by cartel overcharges are entitled to triple the overcharges that they are able to prove in court.

The overcharge has a one-to-one relationship to the Lerner Index, the most common measure of market power in economics. Both measures employ the same numerator (PM - PC), where PM is the observed market price and PC is the competitive benchmark price, but use different denominators. The overcharge ratio is (PM-PC)/PC, whereas the Lerner Index is (PM-PC)/PM. Both ratios are zero when a market is perfectly competitive or a cartel is ineffective in raising prices. The Lerner Index has an upper limit of one when the pure monopoly price is charged in a market. The overcharge has no upper limit.

<doc id="185763" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185763" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">
Wikipedia:Conflict of interest

A Wikipedia conflict of interest (COI) is when an editor wants to do something which does not help Wikipedia's goal, which is to produce a , encyclopedia.

Changing pages to promote your own interests or those of other people, companies, or groups, is a COI. Where outside goals are more important to a user than building Wikipedia, that person has a conflict of interest.

COI is not wanted in Wikipedia. When a user's changes harm the encyclopedia by breaking policies such as , , and , the user's account may be blocked. COI editing can also make the person or group look bad outside of Wikipedia.

It is best if users who have COIs say so, both on their and on the of any article they change. This is especially important if other users may disagree with the change that they make. Most Wikipedians will appreciate your honesty. Editors who try to hide their COIs are often exposed. This gives other users the feeling that they, and perhaps their employer, are secretly trying to change Wikipedia articles to support them.

If you think a user has a COI, you must be careful not to them. Wikipedia's is more important than this guideline. COI situations are often discovered when the editor themselves says how they are linked to the subject of the article they are changing. In cases where the user does not say they have a COI, biased editing can be changed back to follow the policy.

Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a place where people can advertise a service, product or person. As such, it should contain only information that follows its policies, and Wikipedians must make sure that following Wikipedia policies are the most important thing when they are changing pages. Any user who changes pages while thinking that other things are more important than making Wikipedia a better encyclopedia has a conflict of interest.

There are no rules to decide whether a conflict of interest exists, but there are warning signs. If a user is adding material to an article that looks like it might be advertising the user, their family members, employer, or business or personal activities, this means they have a conflict of interest. When editors write to promote things they are linked with, their contributions often do not contain things which the general public would find useful or important. If you do write an article on an area which you are linked to, be sure to write in a and cite reliable, third-party published , and be careful in case your changes accidentally make your point of view more important than the others. is one of Wikipedia's .

If other users suggest that your changes are against Wikipedia's standards, take that advice seriously and think about talking about it with the other users. 

Making changes to a subject in which you are an expert does not have to mean a conflict of interest. Using sources you have helped write is allowed but only if they are truly important and fit with the Wikimedia Foundation mission and principles. Using your work as a source should not be done often. When in doubt, follow what the community thinks.

If one of the points underneath applies to you:


then we very strongly encourage you to not make changes to Wikipedia in areas where there is a conflict of interest, because that would make your edits non-neutral (biased). Wikipedia's policy states that all articles must represent views fairly and without bias, and conflicts of interest do stop Wikipedia from being able to do this. If your changes would not be neutral, do "not" post them.

If you are involved in a court case, or close to one of the litigants, you would find it very hard to demonstrate that what you wrote about a party or a law firm associated with the case, or a related area of law, was entirely objective. Even a minor slip up in neutrality in a court-case article on Wikipedia for an active case-in-progress could potentially be noticed by the courts or their parties, and this could potentially cause real-world harm, not just harm to Wikipedia. Because of this, we strongly discourage editing when this type of conflict exists.

It is not recommended that you write an article about yourself. If you are notable, someone else will notice you and write the article. In some cases, Wikipedia users write articles about themselves when the more appropriate action would be to create a . In these cases, the article is normally moved into the user namespace rather than deleted. If you believe you may be notable enough, make your case on the appropriate talk pages, and seek first, both with the notability "and" any proposed autobiography.

Conflict of interest often presents itself in the form of self-promotion, including advertising links, personal website links, personal or semi-personal photos, or other material that appears to promote the private or commercial interests of the editor, or their associates.

Examples of these types of material include:

Editors should not create articles which serve solely to promote their subject. All Wikipedia articles should contain useful information written as if from a . The writing of 'puff pieces' and advertisements on Wikipedia is strictly prohibited. If you contribute to Wikipedia on behalf of clients, you owe it to both them and the encyclopedia to make very sure you understand the standards for content here, and do not insert promotional material.

Activities regarded by insiders as simply "getting the word out" may appear promotional or propagandistic to the outside world. If you edit articles while involved with organizations that engage in advocacy in that area, you may have a conflict of interest.

Friedrich Engels would have had difficulty editing the Karl Marx article, because he was a close friend, follower and collaborator of Marx. Any situation where strong relationships can develop may trigger a conflict of interest. Conflict of interest can be personal, religious, political, academic, financial, and legal. It is not determined by area, but is created by relationships that involve a high level of personal commitment to, involvement with, or dependence upon, a person, subject, idea, tradition, or organization.

Closeness to a subject does not mean you're incapable of being neutral, but it may incline you towards some bias. Be guided by the advice of other editors. If editors on a talk page suggest in good faith that you may have a conflict of interest, try to identify and minimize your biases, and consider withdrawing from editing the article. As a rule of thumb, the more involvement you have with a topic in real life, the more careful you should be with our core content policies — , , and — when editing in that area.
The definition of "too close" in this context is governed by common sense. An article about a little-known band should preferably not be written by a band member or the manager. However, an expert on climate change is welcome to contribute to articles on that subject, even if that editor is deeply committed to the subject.

Wikipedia is "the encyclopedia that anyone can edit," but if you have a conflict of interest avoid, or exercise great caution when:

Contributing signed-in users may use their to publish short autobiographies within the bounds of good taste and compatible with the purpose of working on the encyclopedia. If you wish to write about yourself without working on the encyclopedia, consider starting a website or a blog instead. a free webhost.

Conflict of interest often raises questions as to whether material should be included in the encyclopedia or not. It also can be a cause, or contributing factor, in disputes over whether editors have an agenda that undermines the mission of Wikipedia. Suspected conflict of interest incidents may be reported on the , and users may be warned with the user warning template. Conflict of interest is not a reason to delete an article although other problems with the article arising from a conflict of interest may be valid .

The first approach should be direct discussion of the issue with the editor, referring to this guideline. If persuasion fails, consider whether you are involved in a . If so, an early recourse to may help. Another option is to initiate discussion at , where experienced editors may be able to help you resolve the matter without recourse to publishing assertions and accusations on Wikipedia. Using COI allegations to harass an editor or to gain the upper hand in a content dispute is prohibited, and can result in a block or ban. 

Wikipedia places importance on both the neutrality of articles and the ability of editors to edit pseudonymously. Do not in order to prove a conflict of interest. Wikipedia's takes precedence over this guideline. WCOI situations are usually revealed when the editor themselves discloses a relationship to the subject that they are editing. In case the editor does not identify themselves or their affiliation, reference to the may help counteract biased editing.

All text created in the Wikipedia main is subject to rules covering criteria for articles (); encyclopedic quality ( and ); editorial approach (); as well as the Wikipedia . All editors are expected to stick closely to these policies when creating and evaluating material, and to respect the good faith actions of others who edit content to ensure it complies with these policies.

Who has written the material should be irrelevant so long as these policies are closely adhered to. The imputation of conflict of interest is not by itself a good reason to remove sound material from articles. However, an apparent conflict of interest is a good reason for close review by the community to identify any subtle bias.

For an article about something obviously important, but which was written with too much COI to easily edit, it is often possible to reduce an article to the basic identifying information and then neutral editors can help the article to be improved. 

During debates in articles' talk pages and at , disparaging comments may fly about the subject of the article/author and the author's motives. These may border on , and may discourage the article's creator from making future valuable contributions.

Avoid using the word "vanity" or similar judgmental terms — this is accusatory and . It is not helpful, nor reason to delete an article. , start from the idea that the contributor was genuinely trying to help increase Wikipedia's coverage.

Another case is within disputes relating to , where underlying conflicts of interest may aggravate editorial disagreements. In this scenario, it may be easy to make claims about conflict of interest. Do not use conflict of interest as an excuse to gain the upper hand in a content dispute. When conflicts exist, invite the conflicted editor to contribute to the article talk page, and give their views fair consideration.

There is a little drama that is enacted more often than it should be.






In reality, Act Five often ends up cycling back through Acts One through Four. This is a Bad Thing.

Remember: an editor with a self-evident interest in the matter turning up on the talk page is an indication that they are "playing it straight". Even if the changes they advocate are hopelessly biased, treat them with respect and courtesy, refer to policy and sources, and be "fair".

This section of the guideline is aimed at editors who may have a conflict of interest. In keeping with Wikipedia's policy, edits in mainspace where there is a clear conflict of interest, or where such a conflict can be reasonably assumed, are strongly discouraged. Significantly biased edits in mainspace are forbidden.

Editors who may have a conflict of interest are allowed to make certain kinds of non-controversial edits, such as:


To determine what is controversial, use common sense. If another editor objects, then it's controversial.

Some editors declare an interest in a particular topic area. They do this in various ways. Many Wikipedians show their allegiances and affiliations on their user pages. You may choose to reveal something about yourself in a talk page discussion. 



This disclosure note shows how a user who wishes to edit on behalf of a topic where they are closely connected can request help from other editors.

In a few cases, outside interests coincide with Wikipedia’s interests. An important example is that unsupported defamatory material appearing in articles may be removed at once. Anyone may do this, and should do this, and this guideline applies widely to any unsourced or poorly sourced, potentially libelous postings. In this case it is unproblematic to defend the interest of the person or institution involved. An entire article that presents as an attack piece or hostile journalism can be nominated for and will be removed promptly from the site. Those who post here in this fashion will also be subject to administrative sanction. gives details on how biographical articles on living persons should be written.

On the other hand, the removal of reliably sourced critical material is not permitted. Accounts of public controversies, if backed by reliable sources, form an integral part of Wikipedia's coverage. Slanting the balance of articles as a form of defence of some figure, group, institution, or product is bad for the encyclopedia. This is also the case if you find an article overwhelmed with correctly referenced, but exclusively negative information. This may present a case of , for example, when 90% of an article about a particular company discusses a lawsuit one client once brought against it. In such a case, such material should be condensed by a neutral editor, and the other sections expanded. One of the best ways to go about this is to request this on the talk page. 

The intermediate territory will naturally contain some grey areas. In many articles, criticism tends to collect in a separate section. There you may find properly referenced reports of well-publicised debates next to vague assertions that "Some people say X, while others think Y." Treat everything on its merits. Ask for reliable sources. Before removing a whole criticism section or article and distributing its parts over other sections of the article, which may be the best way ahead, consult other editors on the Talk page. Use crisp, informative edit summaries to detail what you have done, an excellent way to establish your reputation as a diligent editor. Raise any less obvious reasoning as a note on the talk page, with any additional links that support your edits.

An editor with a conflict of interest who wishes to suggest substantive changes to an article should use that article's . When making a request please consider to avoid misunderstanding.

To request a new article, you can present your idea on the talk page of a relevant article or .

"People who might have a conflict of interest should read this part. Administrators should not use this part as a reason to block somebody." If you read somebody's edit history and all their edits are making a person, company, product, service, or group look good, and it seems like they are breaking this guideline, you should warn them and show them this guideline. If they do the same thing again, they may be blocked.

Binary form

Binary form (or AB Form) is a type of form of music pieces. The term Binary means "in two parts", while Form in music acts as a kind of guideline for composers to design or shape a piece of music. When "binary" and "form" join together, you will get a basic definition of "An outline in two parts". A musical piece in binary form is a musical piece with two sections.
Binary form was popular in the Baroque period and often used to structure movements from sonatas for keyboard instruments.

Generally, a piece in binary form will compose of two parts, which are roughly the same in duration and tones. There are only a few differences between the first part(A) and the second part (B).

Binary form was most commonly used in the Baroque era for short dances called minuets. The minuet's two parts are usually labeled as "A" and "B." In the A section of a minuet, the exposition is stated. This section almost always is repeated a couple times. The beginning part of the B section develops a slightly new musical idea, usually going to the dominant key, to add variation. Then it returns to the home key for the finish. Some famous composers of minuets include Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel.

Bubble tea

Bubble tea, also called pearl tea, is a drink which comes from Taichung, Taiwan. It is made by mixing black tea with non-dairy creamer or milk and adding round "pearl" tapioca. There are many flavors other than the original one. Green tea can be used instead of black tea. Extra items such as honey, coffee or cocoa can be added. Pudding or coconut cubes can be used instead of pearl tapioca.

When it was first invented, not many people were interested in it. But after a bubble tea maker was interviewed on a Japanese TV program, it became popular among people of all ages. The popularity of bubble tea can be seen not only in Taiwan but also in other countries such as Japan, Hong Kong, Mainland China, Southeast Asia, Australia, Canada and the USA.

Foot binding

Foot binding is an old Chinese custom of binding women’s feet with cloth strips in order to keep them from growing more than about three inches. Although some Chinese legends say the practice started during the Shang dynasty(1700-1027 B.C.), written evidence indicates that foot binding began at the court of the Song dynasty(960-1279 A.D.). It continued until the early 20th century when, it was outlawed by the People's Republic of China, a time when the influence of western fashion was increasing. There had been several anti-footbinding attempts before it was outlawed. When the Manchuria established the Qing dynasty, the Manchurian emperors wrote a number of laws banning foot binding, but with little success. In 1874, the first anti-footbinding committee was held in Shanghai by a British priest. Chinese authority continued its efforts to abolish foot binding after the collapse of the Qing dynasty by imposing fines on those who still had their feet bound after 1915. Though not very successful, the People's Republic of China eventually outlawed foot binding. According to the Chinese Xinhua News Agency, the last factory to make shoes for bound-feet women in Harbin, China, had ended production in 1998. 

The practice of foot binding was originally a status sign of the higher class women who were free from manual labor. However, it gradually spread to the lower classes as a means of upward social mobility and by the 17th century Chinese girls, regardless of their social status, all had their feet bound. Because some drastic measures were taken from time to time to attain desired feet size, foot binding usually resulted in lifelong impairments of its victims. According to a UC San Francisco study issued in November 1997, the physical consequences of foot binding had lingered in Chinese society until very recently, especially for women who are in the 70s and 80s age groups. There is also a view that Chinese women were forced to bind their feet so as to maximize the sexual pleasure of their husbands. Foot binding may also be seen as female subjugation. However, this view is often refuted by opponents because they believe that the view is biased against a specific culture with contemporary western standards.

Scott Young

Scott Young (April 14, 1918 – June 12, 2005) was a Canadian journalist, sportswriter, novelist and the father of musician Neil Young. Over his career, Young wrote 45 books, including novels and non-fiction for adult and youth audiences.

Born in Cypress River, Manitoba, Young grew up in nearby Glenboro where his father, Percy Young, owned a drug store. His mother, Jean Ferguson Paterson, had been a schoolteacher before her marriage. After his father went broke in 1926, the family moved to Winnipeg but were unable to afford to stay there. His parents separated in 1930, and Young went to live with an aunt and uncle in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan for a year before moving back to Winnipeg to live with his mother. He left high school at 16 and began working for a tobacco wholesaler. 

Young began writing while in his teens, submitting stories to various publications, most of which were rejected. At the age of 18, in 1936, he was hired as a copyboy at the "Winnipeg Free Press" and was soon made sports reporter. He met Edna "Rassy" Ragland in 1937, and the two were married in 1940.

Unable to get a raise at the "Free Press", Young moved to Toronto in 1941, covering news and sports for the Canadian Press news agency. His first son, Bob Young, was born in 1942 and five months later, Young was sent to England to help cover World War II for CP. He came back a year later and joined the Royal Canadian Navy, where he served until his release from the service when the war ended in 1945. Young returned to CP and soon joined "Maclean's" magazine as an assistant editor. His second son, Neil Young, was born in Toronto in November 1945.

Young began to sell fiction to publications in Canada and the United States including the "Saturday Evening Post" and "Collier's". He quit his job at "Maclean's" in 1948 to write short stories full-time.

In 1949, Young bought a house in Omemee, Ontario near Peterborough. The family's finances would vary with Young's success in selling his stories and he began taking assignments from "Sports Illustrated." His first novel "The Flood" was published in 1956. Young moved to Pickering, Ontario and spent a year working in public relations for a jet engine company before joining "The Globe and Mail" as a daily columnist in 1957 and moving back to Toronto. In 1959, Young met Astrid Read while on assignment in British Columbia and, soon after, he and his wife separated. Following Young's divorce in 1961, he and Read were married. They had a daughter, Astrid Young, in 1962. 

He was also a host on Hockey Night in Canada until getting on the wrong side of Toronto Maple Leafs co-owner John Bassett. The Leafs threatened HNIC's sponsor and advertising agency until they agreed to fire Young.

In 1988, Young received the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame as selected by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association, and was also inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame. Young and his wife sold the farm in the late 1980s and moved to Howth, Ireland, a suburb of Dublin. In 1990, Young received an honorary doctorate from Trent University and donated many of his papers to the university's archives. The Youngs returned to Peterborough in 1992 and repurchased their old farm, which Young owned for the rest of his life. Scott Young Public School in Omemee was named in his honour in 1993. His autobiography, "A Writer's Life", was published in 1994.

He and Margaret moved to Kingston, Ontario in 2004, where Young died the following year at the age of 87.

Canning Town station is a major inter-modal transport interchange in East London. It is served by London Underground's Jubilee Line and the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), as well as being served by local buses operated on behalf of London Buses. It is in Travelcard Zone 3.

The North London Line platforms will be redeveloped as part of the extension of the DLR from Canning Town to Stratford International via West Ham, which would see a more frequent service to Stratford, although passengers to NLL destinations beyond will have to change.

On the DLR City Airport extension there is a station planned south-east of here called Thames Wharf, depending mainly on the regeneration of the area.

Critical thinking

Critical thinking is "thinking about thinking." It is a way of deciding if a claim is true, false, or sometimes true and sometimes false, or partly true and partly false.
To find out if someone is telling you the truth, one needs evidence. Information is found in libraries, online, and by asking people. Professional librarians can help research library sources. Cybrarians can help research using computers. Professional interviewers are good at finding people who are experts in their fields, and they know how to ask the right questions.
To solve a problem, questions can be written as clearly and simply as possible, making certain that all terms are well understood by giving definitions if necessary. Then, this Critical thinking can help one judge how true this information is. Critical thinking tools are taken from many fields of study: statistics, logistics, semantics, experimental research methodology, psychology, sociology.
Research sources should be of good quality: up to date, thorough, well informed, and impartial.

<doc id="185978" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185978" title="Waxing">
Waxing

Waxing is a method of removing hair from the body. Waxing removes the whole hair including the root. Both men and women engage in waxing, as do female children as young as eight. Any area of the body can be waxed but the more common areas are the legs, underarms, genitals, torso and face. There are health concerns about waxing such as pain, inflammation, infection and physical damage to the skin. At least two women have been hospitalized due to bikini waxing. The waxing of young girls has been criticized and concerns over emotional problems have been raised by parents and by doctors and psychologists. Although it is known as "waxing" not all treatments of this kind use wax. Some waxing treatments use a sugar mixture in the same manner as wax. 

Any area of the body where hair grows can be waxed. The most commonly waxed areas are;


Women in Ancient Egypt removed unwanted hair with a sticky mixture of honey and oil. Women in the Middle East have used a sugaring mixture which is made up of a paste of warm sugar, lemon juice, and water. In 1922 Sears started selling razors to women and the ability for them to remove unwanted hair began. Pubic hair removal began during World War II when the US government ordered less material to be used in making women's bathing suits and the bikini was invented causing some women to have hair stick out the sides of the bikini bottom. In the 1960s waxing products became available.

Waxing rips the hair out of the skin and often causes pain. The pain increases in areas such as the genitals, especially for people who haven't waxed before or don't wax often. Redness and swelling also often occurs at the waxing site. Waxing is itself a safe thing, but there are times when it is not safe to get waxed. When skin is sunburned it is not good to get a wax treatment. Allegic reactions can also happen with waxing. People with medical problems such as diabetes, chronic kidney or liver disease, skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis, or weakened immune systems are advised not to get wax treatments at all. At least one woman, with diabetes, almost died due to getting a bikini wax and becoming infected and another woman was hospitalised after being waxed in her genital area. In 2007 the New Jersey State Board of Cosmetology and Hairstyling came close to banning genital waxing based on health concerns. There is also concern about the trend to remove all or most of the pubic hair from a person's genitals. Dr. Linda K. Franks, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the New York University School of Medicine, says "Pubic hair is there for a reason—to protect the sensitive skin and mucous membranes in the genital region, getting a wax literally strips away that layer of protection." Waxing can pull small pieces of skin off the body. This is usually minor and is not usual. Skin infections can also occur such as staph, folliculitis (infection of the hair follicles). Ingrown hairs are also quite common and can become infected.

Young children also get waxing treatment with children as young as eight receiving wax treatments such as eyebrows, legs and genital waxing. Such genital waxing on young girls has been called "virgin bikini" waxes, and is aimed at either reducing the girl's need for pubic hair removal in the future or stopping hair growth permanently with as few as five or six treatments as long as the child has never shaved before. The increase demand for preteen waxing is being met by spas, with some 10,000 spas in offering services only for young girls and early teenagers in the United States of America alone. The International Spa Association has reported that 16% of teens who have had spa treatments have had waxing done. The association has not been able to give figures for younger children because it is illegal to survey them. 

Both parents and children say that young girls feel pressure from television shows and other children to look pretty and sexy and say that peer pressure, magazines, pop stars like Britney Spears and TV shows like Miley Cyrus' Hannah Montana increase children's demands to have spa treatments such as waxing, microdermabrasion and chemical peels. Such pressure has been reported to cause intense stress and emotional problems in young girls. The opinions of boys about girl's beauty is also a pressure to look their best with reports of boys rating girls on a scale of 1 to 10 at school.

Dr. Diane Levin, professor of education at Wheelock College in Boston and co-author of the book "So Sexy So Soon: The New Sexualized Childhood and What Parents Can Do to Protect Their Kids" (a book critical of the sexualization of children), believes child waxing to be bad because it tells girls to “keep your bodies like little girls’ because that’s what men like.” This is backed up with surveys that show that 93% of men want women to, at least, remove some hair from their pubic area. Dr. Doris Pastor, a pediatrician, feels that the problem is not whether young children get wax treatments but that such events might encourage young children and preteens to take part in risky behaviour. Pubic hair waxing of children has caused concern with doctors. Dr. Janice Hillman, of the Penn Health System, a specialist in adolescent medicine, when checking for pubic hair on young girls as a sign of development has said she often has to ask the girls if they wax because it has become so common.

Concern has also been raised by the cost of such treatments, making regular waxing often only available to children with well paid parents, leaving girls from poorer families unable to compete for beauty and so being made fun off by those who can afford them.

Vinoba Bhave

Vinoba Bhave (1895-1982), was a philosopher and revolutionist of India. He was a pupil of Mahatma Gandhi (1869~ 1948), who was called "Mahatma", meaning a great sage. Vinoba Bhave also lived following the doctrine of ahimsa, which means nonviolence. His ideas were also influenced by his grandfather, father, and mother. His grandfather taught him about the purity of spirit. He got the Bharat Ratna award by Indian government in 1983. His father, who was yoga ascetic, taught him how to think scientifically. His mother taught him what a faith is.

There are a lot of accomplishments he made. The most famous thing is "Budan", which is an idea of sharing lands with the poor. He argued that land is not something that can be occupied. He insisted that land owners should donate their one sixth of their land to people who do not have land. He campaigned to give rice to hungry people. And he also did a campaign of self-supporting and self-sufficient. These worked successfully and he became a great man of India.

Kikuyu

Kikuyu is the largest tribe in Kenya. They are 22% of Kenya's population and are of Bantu ethnicity.

There are two theories explaining where the Kikuyu came from. First, it is believed the Kikuyus came from Central Africa, where all the Bantus once lived. They then moved south towards present day Tanzania where the migrating group separated again and the Kikuyus moved towards Mount Kenya, where they settled. The second theory is that they came from a mythical place called Shungwaya, which is present day Somalia. 

According to Kikuyu creation stories, Ngai (their God) made a man, called Gikuyu, and his wife, Mumbi, and settled them on Mount Kenya. Gikuyu and Mumbi had nine daughters who form the major groups of the Kikuyu people. Due to the fertile soil on Mount Kenya and the hard work of the Kikuyu people, they grew more than they needed and started trading with their neighbours, the Maasai (a Nilotic tribe). The Kikuyus swapped their farm produce and crops for the animal products from the Maasai, who kept livestock. It is also believed that the Maasai are the ones who married the nine daughters of Gikuyu and Mumbi.

Members of the Kikuyu tribe speak the Kikuyu language. The Kikuyu greeting is "Atiriri, wimwega?" which means "Hello, are you okay?". The Kikuyu language is similar to other languages like Meru, Mbeere, and Embu which are believed to have been once part of the Kikuyu tribe but moved away and formed their own tribes. Even though tribalism is dying down, the Kikuyu language is still spoken a lot today as a sense of cultural pride.

Famous people from this tribe include: Jomo Kenyatta (the first president of Kenya), Mwai Kibaki (the current president) and Wangari Maathai (the first African female Nobel Peace Prize winner.)
The proper Kikuyu spelling of the greeting should be: "Atiriri, wi Mwega", meaning "by the way, are you fine". The other forms of greeting include "Wakia Maitu" greeting an elderly female, "Wakia Awa" greeting an elderly male, and "Wanyua" for agemates.

Incheon International Airport

Incheon International Airport is the largest international airport in South Korea where all international flights depart and arrive everyday. Gimpo Airport located near city Seoul used to be the international airport of Korea. However as the population grew and needs for accommodation increased in the area, Gimpo Airport no longer could expand its capacity to hold the growing demands for international flights. In order to solve the problem construction plan for new airport that can run 24 hours and meet the growing needs was initiated in 1992. Incheon International Airport is located in Incheon City Jung-gu Unseo-dong (37°27′5″N, 126°26′4″E). Incheon International Airport Railroad (A'REX) and Incheon International Airport Highway were built to increase the accessibility to Seoul. The airport is operated by Incheon International Airport Corporation (IIAC) and it is owned by the government of South Korea.

Incheon International Airport first opened on March 29th, 2001. It was built on the reclaimed land between Yongjongdo and Youngyudo. First phase of construction started in 1992 and it took eight years and four months for completion, costing 7.8 trillion Won. After the completion of Phase 1 construction plan Incheon International Airport could hold up to 170,000 flights, 27,000,000 passengers and 1,700,000 tons of cargos per year. Phase 2 construction plan began in 2002 and was completed on June 20th 2008. After the completion of Phase 2 the airport has the capacity of holding 410,000 flights, 44,000,000 passengers, and 4,500,000 tons of cargos per year. After the final construction phase completed in 2020 the airport will have two passenger terminals, four satellite concourses, 128 gates, and four parallel runways. With the expansion, the airport will be able to hold passengers up to 100 million people, and hold cargos up to 7 million tons per year. The Incheon International Airport has its ultimate goal of transforming into one of the top ten busiest airports in the world by year 2020.
Incheon International Airport consists of passenger facilities (main passenger terminal, passenger concourse A), cargo terminal complex (A, B, C terminal), and operation facilities (control tower, runways, and meteorological facilities).

Sukiyaki

Sukiyaki is a very popular one-pot meal in Japan. The main ingredient is thin sliced beef, and it is simmered in a skillet or pan in the sukiyaki sauce with many vegetables and other ingredients. The word "yaki" means "sautee" or "grill" in Japanese. The word is used because the beef in sukiyaki is sauteed in the hot skillet.

In Japan, because of religious beliefs people were forbidden to eat beef, venison, horse, mutton and other meat from Asuka era to Meizi era. issue of religion. Cattle and horse were also work animals, therefore if people eat cattle and horse meat, people were punished. This is a commandment of Buddhism. But difficulty in making a living meant that people secretly ate boar and venison meat. Over time people ate beef secretly. 

The first sukiyaki store opened in Kyoto at the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The Meiji emperor ate beef. He liked taste of sukiyaki. After that, the emperor lifted the ban on eating beef. People were allowed to eat beef publicly. In the west it is called “Sukiyaki”, in the east it is called “Gyunabe”. It is popular all over Japan. Sukiyaki’s contents do not change now. It is thinly sliced beef cooked in an iron pot, with bean curd, sliced onion, mushroom and other kinds of seasoning. Then the beef and vegetables are picked directly from the pan by chopstick and eaten by dipping them into a small bowl containing raw egg. Sukiyaki became symbol of cultural enlightenment. 

Each Japanese region has preferred way of cooking sukiyaki. Japan can be divided into two regions. The big variation is between "Kansai" (western Japan) and "Kanto" (eastern Japan). In the Kanto (Tokyo) region, sukiyaki is based on "Gyunabe" that was in fashion in "Meiji" period. Before cooking sukiyaki, people prepare the soup stock mixing a seasonings (soy sauce, sugar, "sake" and "mirin") together. They then stew beef in it.

In the "Kansai" region, people grill meat in the pan greased with lard. After that, they put the other ingredients over these, and the liquid is poured into the pan. They do not grill meat and the ingredients that make the meat tough, and they do not grill the meat and watery vegetables at a same time. This is the" Kansai" style of cooking sukiyaki.
The border between the styles of cooking sukiyaki is becoming unclear. Some people say that the border between eastern and western is in Aichi. But recently, ready-made stock, pre-mixed with seasoning used to flavor sukiyaki is sold all over Japan, so the border is no longer clear.

Like the modern oboe, the shawm was played by blowing into a double reed. It was usually made from one piece of wood, with a flare at the end (like a trumpet). It sounded very loud, and was mostly used out-of-doors.
In German the shawm is called "Schalmei" or "Pommer". The first word may have come from the Latin word "calamus" meaning "reed or stalk". There were many kinds of shawm over the centuries in Europe and they had a variety of names. There were also several different sizes.

Ripley is a town in the English county of Derbyshire.

Ripley existed in 1086 when it was held by a man called Levenot. In 1251 Henry III said there could be a weekly market here and two annual fairs. In 1291 there were "two water-mills with fish ponds" in Ripley.

The Ripley area has been industrialized since the late 18th century. 

One of the earliest companies to take advantage of mineral resources around Ripley was the Butterley Company in 1790. One of the early, and most well known, examples of the work of the company includes the graceful arched roof of St. Pancras Station in London, recently restored as an international rail terminal. A recent Butterley achievement was the design and construction of the Falkirk Wheel which lifts large canal boats.

After the war, Jacka went back to Australia and started a business, "Roxburgh, Jacka & Co. Pty Ltd", importing and exporting electrical goods. He was later elected to the local council, and became the mayor of St Kilda, Victoria. Jacka never fully recovered from the many wounds he got in the war and died at the age of 39.

Albert Jacka was born on a dairy farm at Layard, near Winchelsea, Victoria on 10 January 1893. His parents were Nathaniel Jacka and his English wife, Elizabeth Kettle. The family moved to Wedderburn, Victoria when he was five years old, where he went the local school. He began working with his father transporting goods. He was working for the Victorian State Forests Department when the First World War broke out.

He joined the AIF, the Australian Imperial Force, on 18 September 1914. His battalion was sent to Cairo Egypt for training. They landed at Gallipoli on 26 April, 1915, the second day of the Gallipoli campaign. On 19 May the Turkish army started a large attack to push the ANZACs back into the sea. The Turks were able to capture a small section of a trench at Courtney's Post. Jacka jumped into the trench by himself and killed most of the Turkish soldiers in it. For this he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

Ladakhi people

The people of the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir have Turanian (Central Asian) features. People of this region have a cheerful disposition and are peace-loving. 45% of this area are Buddhist by faith and the rest are Muslims. 

They are sincere and honest, and traditionally lead a nomadic pastoral life. About 90% of them depend on agriculture based on the Indus River for their livelihood. Barley, wheat, buckwheat, peas, rapeseed and beans are the main agricultural products. Apples and apricots are grown in warmer regions of low altitude. 

Another occupation of the people is sheep-rearing. The herdsmen are called Chang-pas. They rear long-haired goats and sheep from whose under-fleece the famous Kashmiri Pashmina shawls are made. Chang-pas live in tents and are nomadic, going from place to place in search of pastures. The people are keenly interested in trade. Wool, in raw form is their chief commercial product. The men travel long distances, seeking favourable prices for their wares, which consist of salt, dry fruits and cultured pearls and semi-precious stones. In return they get tea, tobacco, grain, sugar and other essential goods. 
Playing polo on fast-racing ponies is the most popular entertainment in Ladakh. The horse is not changed with each chukker (chukka) as in western style polo, but each player carries on with the same sturdy pony. Primitive wooden balls are still used for the game, played on a rough, uneven pitch whose popularity persists in Ladakh. 

Ladakh offers the hunters exotic hunts of the national animal of Pakistan, ibex, red bear, state animal of Pakistan, wild sheep, antelope, gazelle and marmot. Ladakh is also rich in minerals like gold, copper and semi-precious stones.

International Union for the Conservation of Nature

The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) is an international organization set up to protect plants, animals and habitats. It was first called the "World Conservation Union." It was started in 1948, with its main office in Gland, Switzerland. The IUCN brings together 83 states, 108 government agencies, 766 Non-governmental organizations and 81 international organizations and about 10,000 experts and scientists from countries around the world.

IUCN's purpose is to influence, encourage and assist countriess around the world to conserve the quality and diversity of nature. It also has to make sure that any use of natural resources is fair and sustainable without harming the earth.

The first Director General of UNESCO, (Sir Julian Huxley) wanted to give UNESCO a more scientific base. He set up a meeting to start a new organisation to protect nature.

At the first meeting at Fontainebleau, France, on 5 October, 1948, 18 governments, seven international organisations, and 107 national nature conservation organisations agreed to form the International Union for the Protection of Nature.

From the start the most important task has been to explore and develop arrangements that can allow development as well as helping people and nations to better preserve their flora and fauna. The ICUN has always argued that needs of local communities, people and nations have to be the main part of a conservation plan. Areas needing protection and threatened species would be best protected:

The IUCN now has offices in many of the nations around the world. It is able to provide the services of a large group of mainly voluntary specialists, providing local level advice and conservation services.

Street dance

Street Dance is term applied to dances that were invented by the general public in the 18th century and later in (largely African-related) urban cultures. The term itself comes from the fact that the dances were made in urbanised cities. There aren’t any rules to “street dance” as improvisation and freestyle is emphasized. It is hard to define, but it is basically freely expressing music with one’s body.

There are many different genres of street dance. It is often divided into Old skool and New skool, with 1984 as the dividing year (due to technological effects on the world's cities and youth cultures). In the old skool section, there are categories like tap, locking, popping, and breakdancing. In new skool, there is hip hop, house, and techno.

Red-collared Lorikeet

The Red-collared Lorikeet is a species of Lorikeet, sometimes called a separate species, "Trichoglossus rubritorquis", or a subspecies of the Rainbow Lorikeet as "T. haematodus rubritorquis". It is found living in northern Australia. It has similar habits to its cousin, the Rainbow Lorikeet.

The Red-collared Lorikeet is found in Northern Australia, as far west as Broome, Western Australia, right through the Kimberley region, across the "Top End" of the Northern Territory to the bottom of the Cape York Peninsula.

It is about long with brightly colored feathers. It is the largest of the Australian lorikeets. The head and the face are blue, and it has an orange to red chest which narrows to a thin colored band around the neck, like a collar. Its wings and tail are green, with some yellow tips on the feathers. The feathers on its abdomen are dark blue to black. It has a red beak, and grey to brown legs and feet. The female is the same as the male but smaller. They can live up to 15 years.

The bird is nomadic and moves about in large flocks. They feed on eucalyptus flowers, as well as nectar from other flowering plants such as grevilleas, and seeds from grass trees. It is described as being a restless and noisy bird, making a shrill shrieking noise when flying. It builds nests in hollows in eucalyptus trees, usually near a creek. They lay two dull white eggs in the breeding season from May to December.

The player’s goal is surviving in the historical flood of WW2 and conquering the world (if you can do it). In order to survive in the game, the player has to develop his/her nation’s technology level and organize the nation’s economy for war. And, because each political regime has different characteristics in the process of war, a political statement can be important too. However, because this game is a war game, the most important thing is making the army, navy, and air force, and controlling them to make your nation larger.

Concave lens

For centuries, human beings have been able to do some pretty remarkable things with lenses. Although we cannot be sure when or how the first person stumbled onto the concept, it is clear that at some point in the past, ancient people (probably from the Near East) realized that they could manipulate light using a shaped piece of glass. Over the centuries, how and for what purpose lenses were used began to increase, as people discovered that they could accomplish different things using differently shaped lenses. In addition to making distant objects appear nearer (i.e. the telescope), they could also be used to make small objects appear larger and blurry objects appear clear (i.e. magnifying glasses and corrective lenses). The lenses used to accomplish these tasks fall into two categories of simple lenses: Convex and Concave Lenses.
Take a look at these cool and amazing telescopes from Amazon.com.

A concave lens is a lens that possesses at least one surface that curves inwards. It is a diverging lens, meaning that it spreads out light rays that have been refracted through it. A concave lens is thinner at its centre than at its edges, and is used to correct short-sightedness (myopia). The writings of Pliny the Elder (23–79) makes mention of what is arguably the earliest use of a corrective lens. According to Pliny, Emperor Nero was said to watch gladiatorial games using an emerald, presumably concave shaped to correct for myopia.

After light rays have passed through the lens, they appear to come from a point called the principal focus. This is the point onto which the collimated light that moves parallel to the axis of the lens is focused. The image formed by a concave lens is virtual, meaning that it will appear to be farther away than it actually is, and therefore smaller than the object itself. Curved mirrors often have this effect, which is why many (especially on cars) come with a warning: Objects in mirror are closer than they appear. The image will also be upright, meaning not inverted, as some curved reflective surfaces and lenses have been known to do.

The lens formula that is used to work out the position and nature of an image formed by a lens can be expressed as follows: 1/u + 1/v = 1/f, where u and v are the distances of the object and image from the lens, respectively, and f is the focal length of the lens.

We have written many articles about concave lens for Universe Today. Here’s an article about the telescope mirror, and here’s an article about the astronomical telescope.

Cell biology

Cell biology is the study of how living cells work. This includes the structure and function of the cell organelles, and the carbon-based molecules which cells produce. The most important molecules are DNA, RNA and proteins.

The most important structures in the cell are the nucleus and the chromosomes, but there are many others. The structure of eukaryotic cells is much more complex than prokaryotic cells. This is because endosymbiosis has occurred: some or all of the eukaryote organelles are former prokaryotes. Examples are mitochondria and plastids.

The most important function of cells is to divide by mitosis or meiosis. Cells in a multicellular organism also specialise in different functions, and the different types may look quite to each other.

Lee Min Ho (Korean name 이민호) is a South Korean actor, born on June 22nd, 1987 in Heukseok-dong, Seoul as a second and last child to a family of a father, mother and one elder sister. Though with only few years of filmography, he is one of the most popular actors among the South Korean youth. 
He made his debut in 2006 through a EBS drama "Secret Campus". In the same year, he received a serious leg injury from a car accident and had to close down all his activities. These seven months in hospital and inevitable aftereffects from the accident set limitations in his acting life, making vigorous movement and action scenes impossible. He nevertheless continued his activities in various TV drama and films, but it was not until "Boys Over Flowers" that he received widespread popularity and recognition. With popularity of the drama, his fame also rose, making him the hot issue of 2009. His acting has also gained recognition, and he was named Best New Actor for the 45th PaekSang Arts Awards. Even after "Boys Over Flowers" has ended, he continues to actively participate in various fields, such as CFs and music albums.

Jacques-Louis David (30 August 1748 – 29 December 1825) was both a politician and an artist who lived during the French Revolution. As a politician, he is most famous for being one of the handful of leaders that governed France during the most violent part of the French Revolution. David believed that France should not have a monarchy and instead it should be a Republic. He voted to have the King of France Louis XVI killed with the guillotine. When the French Revolution began to fail, David was happy that Napoleon Bonaparte became Emperor of France.

As a painter, Jacques-Louis David wanted artwork to be political. He often painted heroes from myths or history that he believed represented good ideals such as strength, brotherhood, and virtue. His paintings are very realistic and often portray heroes from Ancient Greece and Rome. This is called the Neoclassical style of painting. 

One of David's most famous paintings is of his best friend Jean-Paul Marat who was killed during the French Revolution. David's painting helped make Marat into a popular martyred hero.

Popsicle

The Popsicle is an American brand name of ice pop. In British English it is called an ice lolly. It refers to a type of snack that is made of flavored ice on a wooden stick. It comes in many different tastes, colors and textures. The brand name includes more than 30 different versions of the snack.
The Popsicle ice pop was accidentally invented in 1905 by 11-year-old Frank Epperson. Epperson left a mixture of powdered soda and water and a stirring stick in a cup on his porch. That night San Francisco went through surprisingly low temperatures, and Epperson awoke the next morning to find a frozen pop that would eventually become a favorite American snack.

At first, Epperson named his frozen snack the "Epsicle," and it became popular with his school friends. In 1923, while running a lemonade stand at an amusement park in Oakland, California, Epperson realized that he could earn money from his invention. Epperson changed the name of his treat to "Popsicle," after his children always asked for "Pop’s ’sicle," and signed up for a patent. The patent for frozen ice on a stick was issued August 19, 1924. Around 1925, Epperson sold the rights to the brand name Popsicle to the Joe Lowe Company in New York. By 1928, Epperson had earned royalties on more than 60 million Popsicle ice pops.

Sexual fetishism

Sexual fetishism, or erotic fetishism, can be sexual arousal caused by any object, situation, or body part. Usually, it is caused by items that are not normally sexual. Sexual fetishism may be thought of, in psychiatric medicine, as a disorder of sexual preference, It may also be thought of as a better way to a relationship. The sexual acts as fetishes are normally not personalized and objectified, even when they involve a partner. Body parts may also be the subject of sexual fetishes (also known as partialism). This is where the body part preferred by the fetishist takes a sexual precedence over the owner.

Photo booth

A photo booth is a vending machine that takes instant-photos. After you pay, usually in coins, a computer based screen and often a recorded voice will tell you when the picture will be taken, how many shots will be taken and when the photo is developed.

Anatol Josepho invented the first self-automated photo booth in 1925. Photo booths began as black and white, film based machines to fully coloured, digitalised machines.

There are many types of photo booths today that offer different sizes and kinds of photos such as passport photos and photos for national ID. Also, some photo booths give you a number of tools you can use to create different features for your photos. Sticker photos are a good example. Sticker photos are instant photos printed on sticker-based material. After you take your picture, you can change backgrounds the tone or the color of the photo and insert letters and symbols. Invented in Japan, photo sticker booths are especially popular in Asian countries among teens and grown-ups alike.

Nowadays, the term ‘photo booth’ also refers to Apple's photography program that features editing tool such as black & white, pencil and comic book.

John Barbirolli

Sir John Barbirolli CH, (born London, 2 December, 1899 ; died London 29 July 1970), was a British conductor and cellist. Barbirolli was particularly remembered as the conductor of the Hallé Orchestra, Manchester, which he conducted for nearly thirty years, turning it into a world famous orchestra. He was conductor of other great orchestras including the New York Philharmonic and the Houston Symphony, and also conducted orchestras including the London Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic, and the Vienna Philharmonic. He often played the music of English composers such as Edward Elgar and Ralph Vaughan Williams.

Barbirolli was born into a musical family. His father and grandfather had come from Italy and moved to London. His mother was French. His father and uncle were violinists.

Barbirolli won a scholarship to study at Trinity College of Music, and later studied at the Royal Academy of Music. In 1916 he joined the Queen’s Hall Orchestra where he was the youngest member. The next year he gave his first solo recital. He spent two years in the army where he got conducting experience with a voluntary orchestra. In 1919 he was again playing in orchestras and twice appeared as soloist with the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra. 

Between 1929 and 1933 he conducted opera at Covent Garden. From 1933 to 1936 he conducted the Scottish Orchestra in Glasgow.

In 1927 he took over a concert that Thomas Beecham would have conducted with the London Symphony Orchestra. He conducted other English orchestras including the Hallé Orchestra and was becoming very well known. He could learn music very quickly. In the 1930s he made many recordings with the London Symphony Orchestra and London Philharmonic, accompanying concertos with famous soloists such as Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz and Arthur Rubinstein.

In 1937 Barbirolli was invited to take over from Arturo Toscanini as conductor of the New York Philharmonic. To follow such a great conductor was a very great honour. He conducted there for five years with great success, although there were some critics who supported Toscanini and were always criticizing Barbirolli. It was a difficult time for him as a new orchestra had just been formed in New York, the NBC Symphony Orchestra which was conducted by Toscanini and they paid their musicians more money. When he was invited, in 1942, to stay on with the New York Philharmonic he decided not to, partly because he would have to become a US citizen.

The Hallé Orchestra, based in Manchester, England, had been famous under the conductor Hamilton Harty. However, in recent years they had been sharing half their players with the BBC. This had saved the orchestra in the difficult years when the economy was bad and during the early war years, but the orchestra was not as good as it had been. Barbirolli was invited to become the conductor of the orchestra, so he moved back to England in 1943.

The first thing he had to do was to rebuild the orchestra. It had not had a permanent conductor since 1933 when Hamilton Harty left. Only four of the shared players with the BBC chose to join the Hallé in Manchester, so Barbirolli auditioned many musicians. The “new Hallé” made several recordings including symphonies by Arnold Bax and Vaughan Williams.

Barbirolli conducted the orchestra for 25 years. In 1958 he became “conductor-in-chief”, so that he could share the work with others. In 1968 he was given the title “conductor laureate” for the rest of his life.

As well as his work with the Hallé he conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra and other London orchestras, and made many recordings. From 1961 to 1967 he was also principal conductor of the Houston Symphony Orchestra in Texas. He was also made guest conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic.

During his last years he had serious health problems His last two concerts were held in the St Nicholas Chapel, King's Lynn, as part of its 1970 Festival. Although he collapsed during the Friday afternoon, he managed to conduct Elgar's "Symphony No 1" and "Sea Pictures". The last piece he conducted was Beethoven's "Symphony No 7" on the Saturday before his death.

Barbirolli is remembered for his great interpretations of Romantic music and of early 20th century English music. He was not interested in very modern music although he did conduct Benjamin Britten’s "Violin Concerto" and "Sinfonia da Requiem" in New York. He is remembered for his performances of Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Gustav Mahler, as well as Franz Schubert, Beethoven, Jean Sibelius, Giuseppe Verdi and Giacomo Puccini. Vaughan Williams gave him the nickname “Glorious John”. He was a great supporter and friend of the great cellist Jacqueline du Pré.

He was knighted in 1949 and made a Companion of Honour in 1969.

His first marriage was to singer Marjorie Parry. His second marriage from 1939 to his death was to the British oboist Evelyn Rothwell who died at the age of 97 in January 2008.

Sasuke Uchiha

Sasuke Uchiha is a fictional character from the manga series Naruto, which depicts a world of ninjas. He is a notable character in the manga due to the fact that the story basically revolves around Naruto, the main character, and Sasuke, Naruto's rival. Readers have considered Sasuke as one of the highly popular character as can be shown on several popularity polls. Merchandise based on Sasuke has also been released, ranging widely from action figures to plush dolls and even to his ninja equipment. Sasuke has also appeared in Naruto related video games and OVAs.

Sasuke is a member of the Uchiha Clan, one of the strongest clans of the village of Konoha. When Sasuke was a little boy, he saw his older brother kill their parents. Itachi Uchiha, Sasuke’s older brother, told Sasuke that he had also killed all of the other clan members to see if he was a strong ninja but that he will save Sasuke’s life because it was not even worth killing. From then on, Sasuke lived a lonely life full of hatred and destined to walk a path of an “Avatar of Revenge” and kill his brother. However, these feelings seemed to be alleviated when he befriended Naruto Uzumaki after graduating Ninja Academy. As they were working together in a team as “Genin" (which means rookie ninja), Naruto showed him what friendship and companionship were.

This ended with Sasuke's encounter with his brother. After battling Itachi, Sasuke realized that he lacked both the strength and intelligence to kill him. Later Sasuke leaves Naruto and Konoha to go to Orochimaru, one of the main antagonists of the series, to learn advanced ninja techniques and to be trained as a stronger ninja. Through mastering “Level Two of the Cursed Seal,” a restricted ninja technique, Sasuke obtains extraordinary power, thanks to is former master. Eventually, Sasuke defeats and kills his older brother only to find out that the order to massacre the Uchiha Clan was made by the elders of Konoha because the clan was destroying the peace of the entire village. However, Itachi could not kill his little brother because he loved Sasuke too much. In order for Sasuke to become able to protect himself, Itachi told Sasuke to live a life of anger and revenge which would stimulate Sasuke’s progress and allow him to become a strong ninja. After hearing about his brother, Sasuke turns his anger toward Konoha and decides to destroy the village.

Naruto is a weekly cartoon and has not ended even to this day. The adventures of Sasuke continue. The story now focuses on the reunion of the two rivals, Naruto and Sasuke. The two friends' goals conflict in that Naruto wants to protect Konoha, whereas, Sasuke plans to destroy it.

Exclusive Economic Zone

Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is an area in the ocean where only one country gets to look into and do economic activity, such as mining underwater resources and fishing. In the case of islands far from the mainland, EEZ stretches from coasts of the islands. Normally, EEZ stretches up to 200 nautical miles (370 km), unless EEZs of two or more countries overlap. In fact, many EEZs actually overlap; many countries argue over where their outermost boundaries of EEZ should be.

It is different from territorial waters in that ships and submarines from other countries can freely travel without any permission. However, this is under the condition that they are just passing by and not taking any resource home.

Baskin-Robbins

Baskin-Robbins is a global chain of ice cream parlor that has franchises in more than 30 countries. Out of 5800 locations, 2800 are based in the United States. It was founded in 1953 by the merger of two separate ice cream ventures of Burt Baskin and Irv Robbins, who were brothers-in-law. Before the merger, the two separate ice cream ventures were called Burt’s Ice Cream Shop and Snowbird Ice Cream. Snowbird Ice cream had 21 flavors at the time, which was praised as novel and fresh. 

After the two ventures were combined into Baskin-Robbins, which would later become a world-famous ice cream parlor, pushed the slogan of ’31 flavors.’ Baskin-Robbins was creative in its approach to put forward the sampling system—letting people taste the different flavors of ice cream with a pink spoon until they find the flavor that they want. Also, Baskin-Robbins was the first to introduce the ice cream cake to the public.
The original flavors when Baskin-Robbins first opened in 1945 were:


Classic Flavors

Seasonal Flavors

Regional Flavors

Bright Choices

Strike zone

The strike zone is the area over home plate through which a pitch must pass to be called a strike, roughly between the batter's armpits and knees. The Strike Zone shall be determined from the batter's stance as the batter is prepared to swing at a pitched ball. The strike zone in baseball is a tricky subject as the strike zone changes with each batter. Accordingly, there is no "automatic" strike zone and much of what is a strike or not a strike is left to the judgement of the home plate umpire.

In short, the strike zone extends from the batters' knees to the letters across the front of his uniform.
To be called a strike, the pitcher must throw the baseball across home plate, an area 17 inches wide (0.4318 meters), and between the knees and letters as indicated.
In professional baseball, a player who stands 5' 6" tall (1.67 meters), for example, will have a much smaller strikes zone that will a 6' 4" (1.93 meters) homerun hitter.
Moreover, the focus is not on where the ball is caught by the catcher, but rather where the ball is as it passes the front of home plate.

Changdeokgung

Changdeokgung is one of the five grand palaces in South Korea. They are Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung, Deoksugung, Changgyunggung, and Gyeonghuigung. The five grand palaces were not built at the same time. Changdeokgung was built as the secondary palace next to Gyeongbokgung. The construction began by King Taejong, the Third King of the Joseon Dynasty, in 1405. Taking 7 years to complete, it was finished in the year 1412. 

In the word Changdeokgung, Changdeok means 'Prospering Virtue', and gung means 'palace'. So the word Changdeokgung means 'the palace of prospering virtue'. Due to the meaning of the name of the palace, the kings of Joseon Dynasty chose mostly Changdeokgung to reside in. 

The palace had been the home of 14 kings of Joseon Dynasty until it was totally destroyed by the Japanese army in the year 1592. After the Japanese were driven back by the combined forces of Korea and China, Changdeokgung was rebuilt in 1612. After the reconstruction, the palace had suffered little damage and became the primary royal court of the Joseon Dynasty. This was because Gyeongbokgung was also destroyed by the Japanese but the Joseon Dynasty did not rebuild it for some reason and the Changdeokgung became the biggest palace in Korea.

However, Changdeokgung had suffered some damage for 350 years after the reconstruction. As a result a large scale restoration took palace from 1990 to 1999. This restoration shows how much the Korean people loved Changdeokgung. Apparently, the UNESCO saw its value as well. Seeing Changdeokgung as a vital global asset, UNESCO listed it as a World Cultural Heritage. The UNESCO said that Changdukgung 'was outstanding example of Far Eastern palace architecture and garden design'.

Changdeokgung is currently located in a park in Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. There are total of 13 buildings remaining in all and the area is designated as Historical Site No. 122. Tourists from all around the world visit this historic site. Changdeokgung is also an enjoyable park for families to spend their weekends.

Earthship

An Earthship is a type of house that is built with natural and recycled materials with energy conservation in mind. Designed by Earthship Biotecture, It is built to produce water and electricity for its own use, made of earth-filled tires and takes advantage of natural heat insulation and ventilation to control its temperature. Since it does not require many public utilities such as gas and electricity, it can be considered as an off-the-grid housing, meaning that it is a housing that can live away from public utilities.

Earthship does not require much external support to sustain itself. Instead, it is built to use resources available from its surroundings. For example, windows are placed so that sunlight is shone inside the house to be used as heating and electricity source. Also, the roofing collects rainwater that is to be used for various household activities such as cooking and washing, and used water is reused as toilet water or processed for further uses.

Modern dance

Modern Dance is related to ballet, but aims at different types of performance, instead of the classical ballets. Many of its dancers have been trained in ballet, and modern dance companies are rather similar to ballet companies. 

The phrase 'Modern dance' is also applied to Ballroom dance of the English (now 'International') style. However, this page uses "Modern dance" as a term to describe 20th century concert dance, on stage. The modern dance style does not have set rules. Modern dancers often create their own dance routines using their emotions and moods, but on the other hand, many performances are choreographed.

Modern dancers prefer a more relaxed and free style of dancing. While ballerinas try to be light on their feet, modern dancers use body weight to increase movement. 

Also modern dancing does not require specific costumes. So modern dancers often dance barefoot and choose whatever they want to wear. Modern dancers try to show their innermost emotions through dancing, often trying to get closer to their inner-selves. This is why many modern dancers choose a subject that is close to their hearts and attempts to express the subject to the audience. 

Modern Dance was developed in the 20th century, mainly in the United States and Germany. In the early 1900s, several female dancers began rebelling against the strict rules of classical ballet.
The pioneers of Modern Dance in the United States were Isadora Duncan, Loie Fuller, Ruth St. Denis and Martha Graham. The pioneers of Germany were Rudolf Von Laban and Mary Wigman.

Optional from ():

Q: Optional in the way of, I won't hold it against you if you don't answer. Here is are my questions... As far as blocking, how tolerant are you for mistakes... and are you apt to giving chances to editors? For example... if an editor who is indef blocked for vandalism and generic disruption comes back 4 months later, requesting unblock, admitting the misdeeds and promising not to recur, would you consider unblocking?

A: I'm not certain. I've indef-blocked (or modified an indef-block of) eleven users at EN (the twelfth was my - a test of the tools), but none of them have asked me to unblock that I recall. Possibly I'd pass it up to for discussion. --""  04:27, 29 June 2009 (UTC)

Q: With regards to protecting pages... How do you decide to protect a page? In what circumstance, if any, would you find it acceptable to protect a page you are involved with?

A1: You see if it is highly vandalized or highly likely to be vandalized, or being edit warred over. Then you check . Then you decide whether to protect. 

A2: You only protect a page you are involved with if it is receiving a lot of vandalism that is clearly "not" related to a content dispute. When in doubt, find one of the other online admins and have them resolve the issue.

Q: Do you "have" to provide administrator assistance to all who asks?

A: Technically? No. Should you? Yes. Though sometimes the assistance will have to be "I can't do that/It wouldn't be a good idea for me to do that because of "x"", as (the article was after many recreations; a similar article was salted after an ). The (hopefully rare) exception would be trolls, whom you should . --""  04:27, 29 June 2009 (UTC)

Q: I know there a a few questions here, and I think you for taking time, if you could do one more... CAn you give me a one liner about trust, in the context of a request for adminiship?

A: It's good? Sorry, one liners aren't my strong point. Instead, how about an ? "I can still recall that one time when I was helping combat a vandalism bot over at EN and my browser kept crashing because of the crazy stuff the bot was putting on the pages..." --""  04:27, 29 June 2009 (UTC)

Bungee jumping

Bungee jumping is an extreme sport in which people jump from higher ground such as a bridge and have a rope tied around them to stop them from hitting the ground. When people jump, they strap themselves with safety equipment like harness the rope is designed to stretch, not break.

It started as the coming-of-age ceremony in a small village on South Pentecost Island in Vanuatu. The young men jump from the top of a 30 meter high tree to demonstrate their courage as an adult. They tied jungle vines around their ankles so that they would not hit the ground.

Modern bungee jumping began when four British men jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. In 1987 A.J.Hackett became world famous when he jumped from the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Later he set up the Kawarau Bridge in New Zealand, with a height of 47 meters, as a commercial bungee jumping area.People could pay money for the fun of jumping. The idea quickly spread around the world.

Bungee jumping has several dangers. The rope has to be the right size for your weight, or it may break. The safety harness has to fitted properly or the force of the drop could cause a person's bones to break. The rope has to be the right length or a person could hit the ground before being stopped by the rope.

Osechi

Osechi is Japanese food made to celebrate the coming of the New Year, called "Shogatsu". It is one of the most important annual events in Japan. "Osechi" food is packed in colorful lacquer boxes called "jubako". Each dish and ingredient in "osechi" has a meaning, such as good health, fertility, good harvest, happiness, long life, and so on. The kind of "osechi" foods eaten in Japanese homes varies from area to area. It is a Japanese tradition to eat "osechi" dishes during the New Year's holidays which go from January 1 to January 3.

One year there was not much food. People did not have enough rice to cook in their rice cooker. Emperor Jintoku knew about this and it worried him a lot. He said that he would lower the taxes in years when people did not have enough rice for New Years Day. After that the taxes were lowered but the House of Emperor Jintoku became poor. Japanese people celebrated this custom on New Years Day. "Osechi-ryori" is a dish that is cooked before New Years Eve to eat on New Years Day.

On New Years Day, the God of the Year, named "Toshigami" comes to the world and the world starts a new year. The god came through a special gate, a "Kadomatsu", into our world. He is god of agriculture. In Japan when agriculture was the main activity of life, people welcomed "Toshigami" and hoped for a rich harvest. A special decoration, a "shimekazari" was put up to welcome the god. Another decoration, a "wakazari", was put up to make sure that nothing would go wrong during the next year. "Osechi" is a meal to give to "Toshigami". In Japan people gave the first part of the crop to god. The rest of the celebration was a feast, called "naorai". 

The beginning of "osechi" starts in the "Yayoi" period. This went from 1000 BC to 300 AD. People at that time were starting to grow rice. As part of a harvest festival, called "Sekku", people made food gifts to please the gods. "Sekku" foods are eaten to thank the gods for the blessing of nature, a good harvest and big catch. This is the beginning of "osechi". This idea came from China.

In the "Heian" period, from 710 to 1185, this event became more common in Japan as the influence of China became more important. There were five seasonal festival days or "sekku", January 7 ("Jinjitsu" or "Nanakusa no sekku"), March 3 ("Joshi" or "Momo no sekku"), 5 May ("Tango" or "Shobu no sekku"), 7 July (T"anabata no sekku") and 9 September ("Choyo" or "Kiku no sekku"). An offering table was set up for the gods. The foods offered to the gods were dry foods, not processed for people to eat. Modern "osechi" comes from the Edo period (1603—1867). These days many Japanese people buy their "osechi" in shops instead of making it at home.

There are many different "osechi" foods, and each has a special meaning. The shape, the color, and the name of each food has a meaning which might bring good luck, happiness or long life. One type of "osechi" is made from black soybean and herring roe. Black is a color which brings youth and long life. The name of the black soybean means that people can live a long life without sickness. Herring roe symbolizes the prosperity of descendants, because there is a lot of roe in each piece.

Chestnuts are rolled into an omelet mixed with fish paste and steamed fish paste Chestnut means a mass of gold and it represents the wish that people get ahead in business and become rich person. A rolled mixed with fish paste mean the culture and diligence because it is a symbol or a scroll from the meaning of dressing up. And red steamed fish paste means removing evil and white means a pure mind. Kelp is a symbol of congratulation and longevity and is auspicious food endowed happiness.

<doc id="186471" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186471" title="Enma">
Enma

Enma is the god of hell in the Buddhist religion. He is often called Yama. He is the god who judges whether the souls of people go to heaven or hell. 

Enma is the god of hell who judges right and wrong after a human dies and falls into hell. Enma gives many kinds of dreadful punishments. The word "Enma" comes from "Yama" in Sanskrit and Pali, a language for Buddhist writings in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand. He is said to be a human ancestor in the "Rigveda" (an ancient Indian sacred book). He is a god of the Indian Veda myth and he is said to be the incarnation of the "Jizo Bosatsu", the stone statue which is the god of help in Japanese Buddhism. 

Believers in Buddhism think Enma comes from the start of the world. He was linked with death at first. People thought he was king of paradise for the dead, the god who ruled people when they lived in heaven. People thought he tied up souls of the people with the rope that he held in the hand. He became a feared god. Then he was treated as just the god of death. Because he is also an incarnation of the god of help, it is said that he can come and go freely between heaven and hell.

The appearance of Enma is really scary. Enma is always shown wearing Chinese traditional clothes from the Sung era (AD 960–1279). Why he wears Chinese traditional clothes is unknown. Usually, his dress is red. He has a square crown on his head and a mace in his right hand. His eyes are open wide and he looks angry. His eyes and eyebrow slant upward. He has a red face. 

However in other countries and at different times in history, Enma is pictured differently. For example, in old pictures from India, Enma has a crown and is riding a water buffalo. He has a club and a big rope. Another Enma from ancient India has a flag and steps on water buffalo with one leg. Enma is well built, with thick arms and a very big chest. He seems authoritative. His looks are really scary. Because of his appearance, it is easy to understand why people fear Enma.

Enma was the first person in the world to die. He went to paradise, called "Gokuraku Jyoudo" (極楽浄土). He lived in paradise and his job was looking after the dead. People believed Enma was the god of paradise. Over time people became scared of Enma. His job was changed from looking after the dead to judging them. Enma used a club and a big rope to tie up the souls of dead people. He ruled the lower world and judged the dead. He decided if a dead person went to heaven or hell. He made his judgment on what they had done in their lives. People who had behaved well went to heaven. People who had behaved badly go to hell.

The stories about Enma are very mysterious. The most famous story is how Enma will pull someone’s tongue out if they did a bad thing. Japanese parents teach their children to be honest by using this story. Enma can also bring dead people back to life. "Abe-no-seimei", a famous person in Japanese history, died and was revived by Enma. He also can decide when life should end. This is the strangest story; an actor died and met Enma. The actor went to hell because he plays other people – it means "lying". He told Enma all about himself his life and Enma started to be interested in his acting. He said “I would like to see you act.” The actor agreed and said "I need a costume, so please give me yours." Enma gave it to him and the actor played as Enma, saying "Ogres! Ogres! Take this bad man away!" Enma was taken away and punished. The actor became a new Enma instead of the real Enma.

There are a number of books and movies about Enma in Japan and even in other countries. Enma has been written about by many Japanese novelists. "The First Love of Enma, Bungeisya", by Hideo Watanabe, is about escaping from hell and falling in love with a beautiful dead woman along the way. Another side of Enma is shown in "Enma’s sword, Syodensya and Hiraiwa" by Koshihiro Igawa and "The Worship of Enma" by Yumie. Enma is not fearful or strong at all. In comic books, like "Dragon Ball Z", Enma is shown as kind and calm. Enma in "Ojarumaru" is funny. In the American movie called "Heaven Can Wait" (1943), a dead man talked with Enma about his whole life before his death. This Enma is not kind but strict. This movie was nominated for best picture. Some writers write about his power and the fear he causes and others write about his opposite side, kind, and calm.

Futon

Futons are traditional Japanese bedding. A futon is a padded mattress, called a "shikifuton", a quilt, called a "kakefuton", and a pillow filled with beans, called a "makura". The futon was put on the floor at night for sleeping. They could be easily rolled up during the day when they were not needed. The word "futon" has come to mean a lot more than this. Although many Japanese people sleep in a bed, they say "I sleep on futon"; it means to go to bed. Futon now means things that Japanese people sleep on, including beds.

Many companies make futons, and there are many kinds of futons. Futons help you sleep comfortably so people choose futons that suit them. Futons are made from chemical fibers like polyester, natural fibers like cotton, feather, down and wool. Japanese quilts usually contain feathers and Japanese mattress usually contain wool.

The Japanese quilt can keep in heat and moisture, depending on what it is made from. Usually, a futon that includes over 50% hemp or cotton is called a "Menfuton". This is popular all over the world. Futons made from down are called quilt down. This retains heat, so this is a high-class futon. Futons made from feathers are called comforters. This is cheap and is common around the world. Futons made from chemical fibers are called chemical fiber futons. This is cheap so this is popular. Futons made from wool are called "Yomo futon". These are warm.

In winter, people generally use "Hadafuton" like a blanket to keep warm. In summer, people generally use "Towelket" like a big towel or Seer quilt which are cooler.

Futons are generally used with a futon cover, because these make it easy to keep the futon clean. People generally use futons so they can sleep comfortably, stay warm and support their bodies while asleep. People usually sweat during sleep, so futons absorb sweat and collect moisture. Futons have to be hung out in sunlight to keep them dry, this is called "futon-hoshi". If this is not done, ticks and mold could grow on the futon and it will become dirty and insanitary. Futons need to be looked after properly.

In the 13th century, most people slept on straw mats, but the nobles slept on "tatami". These were not as soft as futons are now. It was said that they were hard and uncomfortable. For a very long time, people covered themselves with their clothes to keep warm. Most people slept nude. Rich people never did such things.

In the 17th century, bedclothes were made. People made it by stuffing cloth with cotton and wool. These bedclothes are the original form of the futon.

In the 18th century, futon production started because there was more domestic cotton available. At that time, futons were too expensive to buy for average people. They could cost 1,200,000 yen. Futons were important gifts and many men gave them to women in order to seduce them. Prostitutes were sometimes presented with futons by rich men. Prostitutes could be ranked by counting the futons; the higher ranks of prostitutes received more futons.

In those days, futon meant a mattress, not a quilt. Bedclothes were common. In the Kansai area, they used a square thing like a blanket, a "fusuma". The quilt is said to have evolved long before it.

In the 19th century, most people were able to buy futons. The import of the raw cotton began, and many factories were built. Because of industrial development, making futons was easier and more efficient than before. This made the price become down and people were able to afford them.

The manufacturer "Nishikawa" is the most famous. This company is in Kyoto and Tokyo. They make everything for the futons, for example, pillows, sheets, and quilts. This brand has history of 440 years.

In old days, people thought any futon was good as long as they could sleep. But now people want better futons. Today, people like a futon which they can relax on and recover from fatigue. Futon makers have developed futons that can adjust to the human body. This is called "Seiatsu Futon" in Japan. There is some advantages to this new type of futon. Since ventilation is good, they are cool in summer and warm in winter. Since it can adjust to ideal posture when you sleep, it improves blood circulation while sleeping. And they are easy to look after. Also a futon of "low repulsion" is popular among Japanese people. This is said to fit the body of the user. Some users who are troubled by bedbugs on futon like "tick guard" futons.

Yoo Young Chul is a serial murderer in South Korea. He had murdered 21 women from September 2003 to July 2004 in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. The victims were only women, including a would-be bride who was going to get married the next day. After he was arrested on July 18th 2004, he claimed that he had killed 26 people. However, according to investigation done by The Korea Public Prosecutor’s Office, it was found that he murdered 21 people. The judge sentenced him to death on December 13rd, 2004 instead of life imprisonment because of the cruelty of his murders. The judge considered Yoo Young Chul’s statement that if he wasn’t arrested, he would have chopped even 100 people into pieces. Then the crime would have been and the crime was a case of torso murder. The chief judge said “considering the pain the victims’ family suffered and panic prevailed in the society, he cannot avoid the top penalty.” As of now, June of 2009, he is in death row.

He said that he started murdering because of hatred toward women caused by his divorce. He got a score of 38 on psychopath test where the maximum score is 40. The closer the score is to 40, the more likely that the test-taker is a psychopath. But, psychiatrists made a diagnosis that he was normal and that he could act according to his own true will. So, the fact that he was psychopath couldn’t justify the crime he committed. This shocking event made many people in Korea pay attention to psychopath and this criminal case was made into a movie named ‘Chu-Gyuk-Ja’ which means ‘The Chaser’ in English.

Men at Work

Men at Work is an Australian reggae-influenced rock band that formed in 1979 in St. Kilda, a suburb of Melbourne. Men at Work often used woodwind and brass instruments. In 1986, they disbanded, but in 1996 they reformed and are still playing. Their biggest success they had in the 1980s. Their biggest hit song was "Down Under" which went to Number 1 on the charts in the USA and UK. They are the only Australian band to have both a single and an album on top of the US charts at the same time.

Ji Kang Hun

Ji Kang Hun (1954~October 15th 1988) was an escapee from prison in Seoul. 

Ji became well known to Koreans, along with those who escaped with him, as their hostage taking was broadcast live all over Korea. Ji became famous for his saying “If you have money, non-guilty. If you don't have money, guilty.” The phrase criticized social and income inequality of the 1980s Korean society. Also, it raised the issue of “Preventive Custody Policy,” which separated prisoners from the society for a while even after their prison term was over in a preventative approach to potential crimes.

On October 8, 1988, 12 prisoners from Youngdeungpo Prison escaped into Seoul city during their transfer to Kongju Prison. Although they were known to Koreans as cruel and inhumane criminals, they were actually accused of robbery and other small crimes. They escaped because they were enraged by the idea of “Preventive Custody Policy,” and that trials were conducted unfairly to the poor. Their prison term for stealing 5,000,000 won was longer than that of Jun Kyung Hwan, brother of the former Korean president, who had embezzled approximately 60,000,000,000 won.
Among the 12 escapees, 4 out of 5 managed to stay unarrested until the very end. They are Ji Kang Hun (35 years old), An Kwang Sul (22), Kang Young Il (21), and Han E-Chul (20). They moved in search of shelters from houses to houses in Seoul. On October 15th, they smuggled into Ko’s house in Seodaemungu Bukjakadong and took hostage of his family. This hostage taking was broadcasted live on television. Ko managed to sneak out from the house at 4:00 AM in the morning and informed the police. The house was surrounded immediately by more than 1000 police force. The standoff between the escapees and the police started from 4:40 AM. At about 12:00 PM, Kang Young Il came out of the house in an effort to negotiate with the police. He tried to get back to the house, but was stopped by Ji who shot a gun before Kang’s feet. Ji stated that this was his last gift to Kang. Then, two of other escapees, An Kwang Sul and Han E-Chul committed suicide in the other room. Ji asked the police for a cassette tape, Holiday by Beegees. He shouted out to the reporters, policemen, and those who were at the scene, “If you have money, non-guilty. If you don't have money, guilty.” He tried to kill himself by stabbing his throat with a piece of glass that he had shattered from the window while listening to Holiday. During the process of rescuing the refugees, Ji was shot two times by the Special Squad in the house. He died the same day at the hospital for excessive loss of blood.

To this day, the phrase “If you have money, non-guilty. If you don’t have money, guilty” is used to criticize politicians or elites in corporations who get away with bribery and embezzlement. 

A movie based on his escape, “Holiday,” was made in Korea in 2006. The title was named after a song by Beegees, which Ji Kang Hun asked for at the hostage taking scene

I was pointed out talk page on IRC. Is that really the best way to be treating an expert on the subject? Blocking them? I personally feel that they were treated a little too harshly. COI is all very well, but when the subject is "improving" our project, we shouldn't be driving them away. That's another potential editor lost. 23:01, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

I would unblocking with alternative measures. This, even if was to this project. Very respectfully, () 23:06, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

I disagree actually. Strongly. If he was making an improvement, then why was his version deleted through community consensus at RfD? He was asked twice on his talk page to not edit the article. COI was cited in the RfD, by many editors. He did not feel it was wise to discuss his actions, and he made a choice to ignore the warnings. In doing so, he was blocked for his edits to that article. As admins, you are able to view the deleted revisions of the article. If you notice, not one inline citation existed in his version. This is a clear conflict of interest, and it was handled appropriately. I have since been in e-mails with an intermediary (noted on my talk page; from the foundation) over this, and Markus Schulze will know exactly why he was blocked. It was not bitey, nor was it punitive in any way. Best. 18:24, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

I have made a new article for Schulze method. I hope I have made it more in line with our needs here at simpleWP. I understand the method but may have messed up the wording. I'd like to invite all editors to review it. I am willing to work on it until it is right. 00:45, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

Is there a consensus to keep the editor blocked? I would support unblocking at this point. () 03:14, 3 June 2009 (UTC)



<-- Perhaps this topic has exhausted itself? I'd suggest a nice cup of tea for all involved. (imho) 13:32, 3 June 2009 (UTC)


I'm yet again, displeased at how things are handled by way of overturning admin actions. I was never notified about this thread, and was never given a chance to speak about it before it was overturned as being "stupid". Regardless, the block was done after two warnings, both of which received no responses (as well as a notification on en.wiki back in oct. 08, also with no response). I believe Goblin is picking and choosing his methods here. I have placed a block on Markus for COI and this is perfectly acceptable given that we are to follow the norms of en.wiki when in doubt (in other words, if it has never happened here before and we do not yet have a guideline/policy, we are to follow en.wiki). COI on en.wiki, if read properly, will tell you a block can be placed on an editor in this situation. Now, I ask you all here and now, what is the justification for unblocking? Why is Goblins comments aloud to stand? His remarks in the block log are far from what I would expect an admin to be making. 17:42, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

I've created new articles that are avaliable in other languages in Wikipedia. Should I link it to them manually or the bots will take care of them ?! Specially there are some unicode languages and I think the bots won't be able to recognize them. All the best :). () 15:20, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

For a while now (and in the past also) there has been on-wiki and off-wiki discussion regarding the usefulness of anonymous editors and if they should edit here at all. As such, I think it's probably time that the community discuss whether or not we wish to continue to permit editing by anonymous editors or whether we want to disable it. Some smaller WMF projects do prohibit anonymous editing and the MediaWiki interface allows this to be implemented with ease. I'd like to invite all editors to hold a rational, and polite, discussion about this topic. All editors are invited, named and anon alike. 


I'd like to see that anons cannot create pages and edit certain articles, but I don't see why we should ban IP editing. Think of how many one edit accounts could stuff up the server. -- () 01:00, 27 May 2009 (UTC)
Is this not a Foundation issue? Unless the Foundation give approval, wouldn't Simple have to leave the WMF umbrella? () 14:30, 27 May 2009 (UTC)
This isn't a good solution to stopping vandalism. If the vandalism problem is that bad we should install flagged revs or . -- 11:54, 28 May 2009 (UTC)
Seems with all the commotion about Oversightship, this conversation died. However, I think it's an important issue we need to resolve as a community. My impression is that the vandalism:good edit ratio for IPs is about 5:1 (or worse). I wish this were not the case, and we could continue to allow IP edits, but I'm leaning toward blocking them. That said, I think it is much more important for us to have a better system of edit patrolling. Blocking IP edits may help in the short term, but eventually (I hope) this Wiki will become increasingly popular and the current haphazard edit patrolling will be insufficient. 13:23, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

Please see . 19:58, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

I believe I speak for all those involved when I say the onslaught of oversight requests were extremely rushed and unecessary. Would anyone object if they were quietly archived? 19:06, 3 June 2009 (UTC)


Hello team,

As i'm sure you know, there's been some gaps in recently, for various reasons, but we're going to get back to the bi-monthly updates hopefully :).

The latest Issue is just about ready to go and will be out on Monday. If anyone has anything they want to add, either feel free to add it it or let myself, Kennedy, Yotty or Shappy know if you're not sure how to.

Regards, 

Hello,

As this is a Wikipedia for people learning English and for students; should we not be trying out hardest to write each article with the best grammar possible? A small vocabulary with good grammar is what will help people learn. Articles like Red Ring of Death have terrible grammar. Even myself, a person with English as his first language have a hard time following that article; and many others like it. I think this is a problem that needs to be addressed. -- () 22:16, 8 June 2009 (UTC)

... Is happening with DYK? There are multiple hooks that have received but have been moved to Stale/Expiring section. Surely this is incorrect? If they've been approved, how can they be "dead"? Could another editor who works on DYK please review this? Thanks!! :-) 01:22, 9 June 2009 (UTC)

Hi all! 

I know that an ARBCOM has been proposed before and been shot down, but I'd like to get some discussion going on what people would want to see in an ARBCOM if one were to be set up. We have regular issues between editors here and a trawl through the archives of ST, AN and various talk pages will show that this is nothing new. One issue that seems to occur over and over (since 2004 at least) is editors leaving because of a lack of enforcement in behavior disputes and also in content disputes. We're often trying to think of ways to attract new editors but one thing we tend to miss the boat on is how to stop good editors leaving because they just can't take behavioral problems anymore. One of the problems, I think, is that we currently have more active admins than we have active non-admins. Another issue we have is no means of resolving disputes between editors. Now it is my hope that we can propose an ARBCOM being set up, but before that I'd like to invite people to discuss what one would do and how it should be structured. 

Thanks for your time! 02:03, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

"Please discuss what you'd like to see in an ARBCOM (if you'd like to see one at all); what you think it should be able to do, what it should be able to solve, what it would be structured like and how it'd be run. Discuss also what it would not do, and what it's limits would be."

I'd like to see nothing out of an ARBCOM. I think we complain about having too many conversations that direct us away from working on the project, and I think that this discussion will only further waste all of our times. () 02:04, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

I'd like to say that having an ArbCom "would" help us focus on the Encyclopedia more. We often have full-blown, over-dramatic discussion that prevent "all" of us from working on the Encyclopedia. With an ArbCom, it would be just a few trusted administrators so the rest of us can work in other areas of the project. 10:39, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

My Thoughts on this are:

Having recently been involved in a (still ongoing) Arbcom case on en.wiki, I can guarantee that we get a heap "more" drama with an Arbcom. () 11:10, 6 June 2009 (UTC)
I'm for an Arbcom ONLY if I will be the benevolent dictator. PS: . 14:13, 6 June 2009 (UTC)





I don't edit at en much, I'd like to know exactly what ARBCOM is. Thanks, 14:46, 7 June 2009 (UTC)

I happened to be at the italian wikipedia, and I decided to go to their recent changes. They only get 50 edits every 48 hours, and they are a much larger project, so I think we are doing a great job here. () 04:02, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

I've created Rice Riots of 1918 which is the (well, actually last week as it's flipped over now. Please feel free to create redlinks. :) 23:47, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

I'm very interested in seeing Candidiasis as a good article. Take a look, maybe comment on talk or edit? Thanks, () 17:03, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

I made a suggestion on . It would be easier for me and others to welcome users if we had a welcome template (something that explains what simple is, and where to start) so that we can get this information out. I would rather click a link then to have to type the template in, this gadget offers simplicity. Thank you for your consideration, () 17:20, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

There's often been debate as to how many active users there are on Simple English Wikipedia. A simple way of finding out how many users we actually have is to, quite simply, organise a list. So? How many active users actually are there? Please add your name , and we'll get a nice number. We can then break that down into statistics, e.g. % admins &c;. 

Note, the article is now located at 

I made the mistake as well. I did not even check any other wikipedia(s) for this article. Perhaps we should include into the criteria or process a check for other versions from enWP, to ensure the articles or not mirrored in part or whole. So that we don't do what happened again. Barras et al, good catch. I and others missed it. Regards, () 17:07, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

Pmlineditor wanted the article Wijerd Jelckama removed. He added the Quick Delete template - I was strongly against this, having written the article myself. So I removed the template - twice, I believe. Then I thought it was over and done with, but Barras re-added the template. As a result, the article has been deleted. Because it was still a GA nominee, ex-DYK article and had 96 revisions, it was moved to my user space. I was told to inform some admins (Chenzw or Barras) when I had the article ready, they'll move it back once it no longer looks like the EN version and then I'll take it to DYK again. I'm hoping for some help (the article had potential, as I was told), and I'm no native speaker of English. () 17:21, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

Since I am not entirely familiar with all the rules (there so damn many, afterall), I did not understand at first why the tag was placed. I was like: come on, don't you guys have something better to do? And using didn't cross my mind. I was really angry at the moment: after all the time I have been working on the article, I hated the idea of seeing it get deleted. () 17:37, 13 June 2009 (UTC)


(outdent) Apologies, my assumption. block action. I think about the only thing that could be done is to explain nicely on the user's talk page, what 3RR is. The editor clearly wants to contribute, lets not discourage him, but gently reinforce that we do have rules. Best, () 18:02, 13 June 2009 (UTC)ce

I would note, since this is a common misconception that doing something 3 times is a violation of 3rr. It actually takes a 4th time to violate 3RR. - () 00:29, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

About my query regarding the PGA process? :) () 18:27, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

...that is still active but hasn't been edited in the last 3 days? Please feel free to drop by, nominate an article, approve a hook, or just comment on what you like. 01:42, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

Crosspost... Discussing a change to the Recent changes over here --> () 14:35, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

I would also like to draw some attention to this proposal. Regards, () 14:56, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

I've been hearing some talk from people who only edit Simple about how certain users here are turning us into a "New EN". Let me just point out and say than EN's formula works, EN is one of the top ten most viewed websites. I'm not quite sure ours is. Our articles are of poor quality, and we're looked down upon by other wikis as a dumping ground for immature users. What are people's thoughts on this? 20:32, 5 June 2009 (UTC)
I think this is a great project. Coming from EN this project isn't as harsh. It is a great place to start. If we could get more people aware of this wiki and get more people from EN helping out this project could turn out great. Of course Wiki's are always a work in progress and there is always something to do!-- () 01:52, 7 June 2009 (UTC)

Truthfully, Simple has drifted away from its purpose and beginnings. Under , it is said that, "Simple English is not the right place to put the same articles again. Instead, we write about the most common subjects so that people from every language can read the pages easily." This is no longer true. Hitting "Show any page," articles like The Fortress of Solitude come up when important articles such as Country are stubs. What needs to happen on Simple is that Notability guidelines need to be a lot tougher to weed out articles that are not "the most common subjects." Otherwise, simple is not much different than EN. () 00:47, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

Pardon, I am a newly registered user an I saw this discussion. I just want to say that Wikipedia (Simple English) is perfect! Big changes are not necessary. The only problems are that the Simple English articles are too short, and we also have to prevent people giving false information or changing articles for fun. Other than that, Wikipedia (all) is perfect! There is always an article for my curious mind! From Alpha to Omega, that is! I really would like to help financially but since I am just 13 years old, I can't/don't have a credit card. And now that I have a Wikipedia account, I would do everything just to improve it! Long live, Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia! () 01:54, 20 June 2009 (UTC)Tar the Mouse : June 20, 2009

I have noticed that on this Wikipedia there are few or no references on articles. Would it be possible for a group of editors to come together and begin to select one article a week and fully reference that article. Just a thought, 00:40, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

Hi there! I want to propose clear rules for de-adminship of inactive sysops. Actually, we don't have a policy. At the moment, we creat for every de-adminship an extra page with a request. I think it would be helpful to have a policy. So, we don't have to vote for every de-adminship. We could remove the tools easier. My thoughts:


Any thoughts? () 19:39, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

I've created a new template to replace the traditional typing of "None currently" or "None at this time" at . Your edits and comments are appreciated.    12:58, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

Does QD A3 cover the copying of the entire article or of parts? For example, if an article was created here at seWP containing the first paragraph from enWP without a change, will it be QDd? Does A3 mean copying of the entire article?    16:29, 19 June 2009 (UTC) 

Should be archived? Should we put a notice there for people who want to propose changes to the policies post them here (at Simple talk) instead? -- () 06:07, 20 June 2009 (UTC)

Hey all,

Final call for any Simple News Articles or Announcements - please send in anything you have as it's looking quite sparse at the moment.

Regards,

What are your thoughts on creating talk pages with talk headers (like enWP's system)?    09:38, 18 June 2009 (UTC)
Sorry, I was on wikibreak far away from thew net; A "Talk header" in the style of "This is the talk page of foo.." Only makes sense for very big talk pages, which change very often; we do not have them (Other than the generalised WP:ST, and WP:AN; And talk pages that only consist of said header kinda look silly. This is of course only my opinion, you are free to disagree with it. -- () 08:24, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

Hello all,

I have enjoyed my Wikibreak far away from all the evil inventions of mankind. I enjoyed my holidays in the sun, on a beach, somewhere in France. Coming back I am refreshed, I also have new "ideas" where Simple could be, in a few months from now. Or most serious problem is a general lack of editors; almost all of our editors are admins (which is not a problem for now). However, I'd like to propose to "focus" the project to some extent.

What we now need is not so much the articles on starlets, or rock bands, but articles about what I would like to call "hard science". With this I do not only mean what you would call the natural sciences, but also other scientific topics, touching history, philosophy, "the arts", and to some extent politics. If you look at the news of today, there will be some topics which are likely found all around the world. Certain world leaders, nations, or organisations will be mentioned; Making articles, or extending the ones we have about those topics might be worthwhile. I know their "lifetime" is limited (next week, the media will talk about other things), but such articles might help us attract casual readers who read the article in their own language and then find out about a new "language" that they might even understand. 

I know that I do not need to convince those already convinced. Sorry, back to noise now. -- () 17:49, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

Hello. Most people voted against the old proposal of addition/changes to the deletion policy concerning talk pages. However, we need an official policy, because some of the current administrators blank such pages, while others delete them. What do you think that should be done to new talk pages unrelated to the improvement of their corresponding main articles? 







I think you need to define useless. That is what the problem most people had with it. If the page falls under one of the other QDs then yes they should be deleted. But a talk page should almost never be deleted unless they are only vandalism. Blanking probably shouldn't happen either as you are not supposed to alter others comments. In otherwords this is why we choose admins, to make these kinds of calls on a page by page basis. There is no need to legislate it. When it comes down to it, I think in the other proposal most people actually said we already have policy covering these situations so why write more. - () 06:26, 20 June 2009 (UTC)

Valya Balkanska

Valya Mladenova Balkanska (born January 8, 1942) is a Bulgarian folk music singer. She is most famous for performing the song "Izlel je Delyo hajdutin", which was sent to space on board the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes in 1977.

Valya Balkanska was born in a hamlet consisting of seven houses near the village of Arda in the Rhodope Mountains. Since her childhood years she has been singing Rhodopean folk songs, which she learned from her mother and grandmother, as well as at work-bee parties. In 1960 she became the main soloist of the "Rhodopa" State Ensemble for Folk Songs and Dances. She was only 18 years old at that time. Up to this day Balkanska has performed more than 300 folk songs, having been accompanied by the bagpipe player Petar Yanev for the last 14 years.

The most important moment in Balkanska's career came with the folk song "Izlel je Delyo hajdutin", which she recorded together with the bagpiper Dimitar Petkovski. In 1972 it became part of the Voyager Golden Record, a collection of songs, sounds and images from our planet, which also contains works of famous composers such as Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, and Stravinsky. NASA put copies of the record in the "Voyager 1" and "Voyager 2" space probes and launched them on August 20, 1977. According to Carl Sagan, one of the creators of the Voyager Golden Record, only advanced alien civilizations would be able to play it. 

In 2004 Balkanska released an album called "Glas ot vechnostta (Voice from the Eternity)", comprising some of her most popular songs such as "A bre yunache ludo i mlado, Goro le goro zelena", and "Maychinko stara maychinko".

Balkanska received numerous awards throughout her career as a folk music singer. One of her favourite recognitions is a golden statuette from the Art Olympiad in Los Angeles in 1997. In 2002 the Bulgarian president honoured her with a "Stara Planina" medal, considered the highest national award. In the same year she also received the "Golden Lyre" award by the Union of Bulgarian Musicians and Dancers. Balkanska became an awardee of the "Golden Phenomenon" prize for helping the popularization of Bulgarian folk music and culture and for the same reason she was the first Bulgarian to be honoured by UNESCO as a "citizen of the planet".
According to "Time Magazine" she is one of the people symbolizing the future of Europe, stating that apart from being "a legend in her own country, Valya Balkanska is very much a legend in space, too". Since December 2005 she has her own star plate on the Bulgarian Walk of Fame. In 2005 Balkanska was also one of the nominees for the "St. Paisiy Hilendarski" national award for notable artists and performers. In May 2009 the Bulgarian Association of Regional Media chose her as "The Most Exceptional Bulgarian Woman". 

In 2008 "Standard", a Bulgarian daily newspaper, conducted a survey on what Bulgarians consider as their most important symbol of national pride. Nearly 22 thousand readers of "Standard"'s online edition from more than 10 countries around the world took part in the poll. Among the 23 possible choices, Valya Balkanska came in first with 9.46% of the votes. She ranked higher than the inventor of the computer John Atanasoff, the world record holder in the women's high jump Stefka Kostadinova, and even the declaration of independence of Bulgaria in 1908.

Korean commerce code

The Korean Commerce Code (KCC) was originally enacted on the 1st of January, 1963 . 
It currently consists of 5 major chapters: General Provisions, Commercial transactions, Company, Insurance, and Maritime Commerce. Amendments were made in 1963, 1984, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2008, and 2009. The code faced the most dramatic changes under implementing IMF mandates during Korea’s foreign currency crisis in 1998. 

After when the generally-revised KCC mainly containing new amendments concerning stock companies, went into effect on October 1, 1996, there were follow-up amendments of the KCC in October 1998 to comply with the IMF-mandated program. These amendments were commentated to support corporate restructuring and enhance managerial accountability and transparency through efficient monitoring. 
The concept of directors' fiduciary duty of loyalty was introduced into the statute in the KCC and was imposed as statutory obligation on directors of stock corporations. The KCC also newly included the concept of de facto directors liable for damages under certain circumstances. This enabled the KCC to enhance managerial accountability by holding “owners,” who do not hold any official corporate directorship, liable for mis-management and misconduct. Additionally, through the introduction of the shareholder proposal rights, the status of minority shareholders improved, securing the opportunities of minority shareholders to propose certain issues to the board of directors and the general shareholders' meeting.

Dilatation and Curettage

Dilatation and Curettage is a surgical procedure to remove tissues from the inside of a woman's uterus. It was, in former times, considered a type of abortion. In such cases, the baby is removed by use of a "curette" (looped, steel knife). The "curette" is inserted up through the cervix, into the uterus. The "curette" is then used to cut apart the baby and placenta. The remains of the baby and placenta are then scraped into a basin.

He spent his most childhood with his maternal grandparents, which he later mentioned as "the blessing in his life" for its carefree environment. He entered Hitkarini College in Jabalpur at his age of nineteen. Asked by the principal to leave the college, he transferred to D.N. Jain College and completed his B.A. in philosophy in 1955. After obtaining his M.A. in philosophy in University of Sagar in 1957, he started teaching at Raipur Sanskrit College and became a professor at Jabalpur University in 1960. While teaching at colleges, he accumulated the fame as a public speaker travelling throughout India and giving out public speeches. He later was deemed to be as Indian mystic by public. He ended his life in 1990 at his ashram in Pune. The exact cause of his death still remains questionable.

One of his strong hopes was creating what he called "new man", who embodies characteristics of Gautama Buddha and Zorba the Greek (from the novel by Nikos Kazantzakis) at the same time. Through this concept, Osho tried to reject neither science nor spirituality, but embrace them both. According to him, “New man” is not subject to one’s sex and does not belong to institutions such as family, political ideologies, or religions. Claiming the idea of “New man” publicly, Osho were often compared with other counter-culture gurus, and postmodern and deconstructional thinkers by people.

Visual kei

Visual kei (aka visual rock) refers to the huge musical movement among Japanese musicians since the late '80s. They were mostly influenced by glam rock of the Western music market, in a sense that they use striking fashion and theatrical performance to highlight their music.

Early visual kei bands were strongly influenced by glam rock and heavy metal. Over years, visual rock music has gone under considerable changes to meet the consumers' taste for music. Today, visual rock music encompasses goth, industrial, J-pop, and hip hop. With this revitalization, visual kei has earned more public awareness and the new title, "neo-visual kei".

While visual kei is rather an obscure theme as a music genre, it is credited as a major spur to the Goth lolita fashion trend. Visual kei bands are generally perceived as rock artists with flaboyant dress, androgynous looks, jewelry, hair dyed and sprayed, and thick make-up. Most Goth lolita dressers cite that they are inspired by their favorite visual kei bands.

X Japan, a legendary Japanese rock band, is widely recognized as the pioneer of visual kei. Other renowned bands that contributed to boost visual kei's popularity include Malice Mizer, Luna Sea, and Dir en grey.

Marketing mix

The marketing mix is the combination of elements necessary to the planning and execution of the total marketing operation. The total marketing operation mainly consists of three 
processes : Analyzing the situation of companies, STP, Marketing mix. Marketing 
managers first analyzes the situation of the company and then conduct STP : Segmentation, 
Targeting, Positioning. In STP, they segment the market, choose the target market in which 
the company can have competitive advantages and determine what is to be their products' 
position in the market, and then they design the marketing mix. In the process, marketing 
managers should design an internally consistent and mutually supportive marketing mix.

It was specifically divided into the 4Ps : Product, Place, Price and 
Promotion by E.Jerome McCarthy in 1960, and from then it has been dealt with various 
variables. These variables include not only goods and services but usage, 
value, image and so on.

In devising the marketing strategy : the total marketing operation, it is usually said that getting a competitive advantage should be considered importantly than any other factors. Thus, product and price is firstly determined because in the case they could be seen more related to the competitive advantage. In that case, decision-making about place and promotion is considered relatively later after determining the strategic position of the products by comparing rival products and then giving relative quality of products, price of products to the market. However, it is usual way of using marketing mix, and the relative importance of each mix can be different in many cases in terms of the situation of the market, the characteristic of the product, the characteristic of the company and so on. Thus, place or promotion can be the highest priority in any cases. In conclusion, marketing managers must pursue the most appropriate marketing mix with a bid to achieving competitive advantage using minimum effort.

Infiltration tactics

Oskar von Hutier was one of Germany's most successful and innovative generals of World War I.

After rising to army command early in 1917, Hutier began to apply the lessons learned from his three years of commanding troops, along with his study of tactics used by other armies. He devised a new strategy for the Germans to break the stalemate of trench warfare. These tactics were to prove so successful in 1917 and 1918 that the French dubbed them "Hutier tactics", although the more commonly used term today is "infiltration tactics".

The first of five planned offensive operations was called Michael. At the beginning on 21 March 1918, they took three armies, for a total of 42 divisions. The aim was to break through the salient at the junction point between the French forces (south) and the English (north), with operations between Bapaume and Saint Simon, intending to then create a wedge between the two contingents, pushing the British Expeditionary Force out towards the sea. On the first day the defensive lines were already smashed against both Allies, and the Germans completely succeeded in advancing 65 kilometers long into a salient of approximately 80 km. In their sweeping advance the German troops met greater resistance against the English than the French. But although the Germans were successful at first, after a few days the German offensive was suddenly exhausted, and beginning March 27, when the French began to engage their strategic reserve near Amiens, the Germans had no more substantial territorial gain. So the Germans failed to achieve a strategically important victory, and indeed, it had lengthened the battle line and created a salient exposed to Allied counter-offensives.

One of the most famous conductors the orchestra had was Hans Richter who was music director from 1899 to 1911. During this time the orchestra gave the first performance of "Symphony No. 1" by Sir Edward Elgar.

The orchestra suffered during the economic crisis of the 1930s and when World War II started. At that time it was sharing many of its players with the BBC. There were only 30 players left. A new conductor was appointed in 1943: John Barbirolli. He was the musical director for 27 years. During this time the orchestra rose to international fame. 

Kent Nagano was principal conductor of the orchestra from 1992 to 1999. The orchestra moved from the Free Trade Hall to the Bridgewater Hall in 1996.

The Red Queen

The Red Queen is the name of an evolutionary theory of Leigh Van Valen and, later, a book by Matt Ridley. 

The term is taken from the Red Queen's race in Lewis Carroll's "Through the Looking-Glass". The Red Queen said, "It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place." The Red Queen principle can be stated as follows:

The hypothesis is used to explain two different phenomena: the advantage of sexual reproduction at the level of individuals, and the constant evolutionary arms race between competing species.

The book takes Van Valen's idea, which is about co-evolution, and extends it into a discussion about sexual selection in humans. It argues that few aspects of human nature can be understood apart from sex, since human nature is a product of evolution, and evolution in our case is driven by sexual selection.

Sex is an evolutionary puzzle. In most sexual species, males make up half the population, yet they bear no offspring directly and generally contribute little to the survival of offspring. This latter point is of doubtful validity in many birds and mammals. In human paleolithic populations, males were no doubt vital for hunting and protection. Many bird species rear the young jointly. However, most invertebrate species are not raised by parents at all, with larvae developing amongst the plankton. In addition, males and females in many vertebrate species spend resources to attract and compete for mates. Sexual selection may appear to favor traits that may reduce the fitness of an organism, such as brightly colored plumage in birds of paradise, which makes them more visible to predators. Thus, sexual reproduction appears to be highly inefficient. 

The book begins with an evolutionary account of sex itself, defending the theory that sex flourishes, despite its costs, because a mixed heritage confers to each generation a defensive "head start" against parasites and disease. The basic reason for this is the way sexual reproduction increases the genetic variety in a population. This greatly increases the chance of at least some individuals surviving the onslaught of predators, parasites and diseases. This much is common ground amongst evolutionary theorists.

Ridley then argues that human intelligence is largely a result of sexual selection. He argues that human intelligence far outstrips any need for survival. He says our intelligence is like the peacock's tail, a product of sexual selection. Human intelligence, he suggests, is used primarily to attract mates through prodigious displays of wit, charm, inventiveness, and individuality. This view of intelligence is also treated at length by Geoffrey Miller. The history of ideas on sexual selection and the evolution of sex is treated by Helena Cronin.

FIDE

The word FIDE means Fédération Internationale des Échecs. It is the world chess organisation, connecting all national federations. It decides matters like World Championships and changes in rules of the game.

FIDE was founded on 20 July 1924 in Paris, France. However, it had little influence until the end of WW II. The reigning worldchampion at that time, Alexander Alekhine, did not want to have anything to do with it. He regarded the worldtitle is personal property. This only changed when he died in 1946. Another event was the strong Soviet chess federation joining the FIDE in 1946. It had a lot of influence and many young strong players.

In 1948 a tournament was organized to determine which of the world top players was entitled to call himself World Champion. The death of Alekhine had left a vacuum. One of his challengers before the war, José Raúl Capablanca from Cuba, had also passed away. 

The six players chosen by FIDE were:
In the end, Reuben Fine dropped out, and the other five contested the event. Mikhail Botvinnik won the tournament and became the new world champion.

In 1950 the FIDE awarded its first IM ("International Master") and GM ("International Grandmaster") titles. However it was not until 1957 that FIDE formulated clear criteria to award these titles. In 1970 a new ranking system, the Elo-rating, was introduced.

With the collapse of the Soviet Union FIDE lost a powerful partner. This resulted in a long period of trouble. In 1993 worldchampion Gary Kasparov and his challenger Nigel Short left FIDE. They founded their own organisation for professional top players, the PCA ("Professional Chess Association"). So now there were two worldchampions: one from FIDE and one from the PCA. 

It was not until 2006 that the dust settled down and a re-unification match between Vladimir Kramnik and Veselin Topalov took place. In 1999 FIDE was recognised by the International Olympic Committee. In 2001 FIDE played by anti-doping rules, trying to make chess for like a candidate for the Olympic Games.

Chess master titles

A Master in chess is a player who is awarded a master title by the world chess organisation FIDE, or by a national chess organisation. The term was used for a long time to describe someone who is an expert player, but it now has an official meaning. 

Grandmaster is a chess title for even stronger players. The title comes from the word in Middle French: "Grand maistre" was the title given to the head of an Order of Knights, such as the Knights Templar or the Teutonic Knights. Its first use in chess is a comment in the periodical "Bell's Life" (18 February 1838) referring to William Lewis as "our past grandmaster".

FIDE titles were first awarded in 1950.<ref name="H/W">Hooper, David and Whyld, Kenneth 1992. "The Oxford companion to chess". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-866164-9</ref> There are four levels of mastery. There are detailed rules as to the number of games played at a given level, and the full rules are quite lengthy. Some countries go with this system entirely, but others have their own system as well. 

Once awarded a title, the player keeps it for life. 

In order of merit, with official abbreviations, they are:

There are also women-only titles:

It can be seen that a woman grandmaster is a lower standard than an international master. The purpose of women-only titles is to encourage female players, because there are few female players in the game.

A Grandmaster is the highest title that a player can get, except becoming a world champion. It is given by the world chess organisation, FIDE.

Meeting the demands is not easy. To become a grandmaster is very difficult. To become a grandmaster, a player has to play at least 27 games with at least two grandmaster-results. In practice this means achieving at least three grandmaster-results or "norms". The tournament rating must be 2600 at least. Besides this, a player's own FIDE rating must be at least 2500. Men and woman can earn the GM-title by meeting the demands.

A chessplayer who is already an IM (international master) will simply become grandmaster, but it is not necessary to get the IM title first.

As chess became more popular in the latter half of the 19th century, the term began to be given out by organizations. For example, in Germany, there arose an annual sponsored tournament, the "Hauptturnier", the winners of which were awarded the title of "Meister". Emanuel Lasker, who later became World Champion, first earned a master title in one such tournament. The Soviet Union had a system of national candidate masters, masters and grandmasters before World War II, and the satellite countries in eastern Europe followed suit after the war. 
In the United States, the title of "National Master" is awarded for life, regardless of whether his rating goes below 2200 later. In August 2002, the USCF (United States Chess Federation) decided that "Any USCF member, who has had a normal post-tournament rating of 2200 or higher, has demonstrated a significant level of chess ability and thought, and is automatically awarded the lifetime title of National Master".

Pungmul

Pungmul is a Korean traditional music that includes drumming, dancing, and singing. Most performances are outside, with tens of players, all in constant motion. Pungmul is rooted in the dure farming culture. It was originally played as part of farm work, on rural holidays, at other village community-building events, and in shamanistic and Buddhistic rituals. Pungmul performers wear very gorgeous costumes. A flowery version of the Buddhist kkokkal is the most common head-dress. Advanced performers sometimes wear sangmo, which are hats with long ribbon attached to them that players can spin and flip in intricate patterns by moving their heads.

Drumming is the most importalnt element of Pungmul. Each group is led by a kkwaenggwari (small handheld gong) player, and includes at least one person playing janggu (hourglass drum), buk (barrel drum), and jing (gong). Wind instruments (t'aepyongso and nabal) are sometimes played along with the drummers. Following the drummers are dancers, who often play the sogo (a small drum that makes almost no sound) and tend to have more elaborate choreography. Finally, japsaek (actors) dressed as caricatures of traditional village roles wander around to engage spectators, blurring the boundary between performers and audience. Minyo (Korean traditional chants) are performed in Pungmul sometimes, and audience members enthusiastically sing and dance along. Most Minyo are set to drum beats in one of a few jangdan (rhythmic patterns) that are common to Pungmul, Sanjo, P'ansori, and other traditional Korean musical genres.

Afro

The afro is a type of hairstyle that is noted for its large size. The hair is curled out, forming a ball shape. For some people, this is how their hair grows, because it is naturally curly. Not all beauty salons can offer this hairstyle though.

An afro can be any length, short or long, but it is different for everyone, especially depending on the person's race and ethnicity. Europeans and Asians will tend to have wavier, looser curls, while those of African descent will have stronger, tighter curls. Some Jewish people also can naturally grow afros, because of their curly hair. These hairstyles are often called "Jewfros." 

The afro requires more looking after than other hairstyles, but there are many ways to style the afro. There is a special comb called the Afro pick/comb that helps get rid of tangles and smooths the hair's texture.

Palmengarten

The Palmengarten is one of two gardens in Frankfurt am Main. It is located in the city area Westend-Nord.

The garden was privately paid for and built by the architect Heinrich Siesmayer. Work was done in 1871 and the garden opened to the public. One special visit was from the American entertainer Buffalo Bill. Buffalo Bill performed his Western show at the garden in 1890. In 1931, it was placed in the care of the city of Frankfurt. The garden was later moved to the occupation after World War II. When the Palmengarten was returned to the city's control in the 1960'a, a major rebuilding started. The halls that were destroyed in the war were redeveloped and expanded. In 1992 the reconstruction finished and the Palmengarten showed in its new form.

Next to the area of the Palmengarten is the Frankfurt Botanical Garden, which belongs to the biology department of Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt.

The botanical exhibits are placed according to their start in free-air or climatized greenhouses, which also contain numerous tropical and subtropical plants.

With 29 hectares, it is the biggist garden of its kind in Germany.

Jeju-do

Jeju-do (translated Korea for Jeju Province) is the largest island of South Korea. The island was created as a result of a volcanic eruption. Jeju-do is located in the southern part of South Korea. Many people visit this island on a honeymoon or to sight-see. Because Jeju-do is located in the southern part of South Korea, it's warmer than the rest of South Korea.

Jejudo has exotic views and fruits compared to other places in South Korea. A few things it is famous for are Jeonbokjuk (a kind of congee made of abalone), Dekopon and Hallasan which is one of the highest mountains in South Korea and placed at the center of Jeju-do. The Natural World Heritage Site Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes is also present on the island.

From ancient times, Jeju-do has been said to have plenty of women, winds, and stones. Because Haenyo is the professional job of getting seafood, women have been an important part of family economics in Jeju-do. People on Jeju-do tie some ropes over their roof so that it can withstand strong winds. Jeju island is based on basalt. Because basalt has many holes, people had trouble with getting water to drink. As a result, they used Heobeok to carry water.

<doc id="186880" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186880" title="Gravitational lensing">
Gravitational lensing

Gravitational lensing is caused by a massive body between a distant object and ourselves. It can create the appearance of two or more objects where there is really only one. The light from the object gets bent round the massive body in between.

The massive body, such as a galaxy or black hole, creates a very strong gravitational field in space. The exact nature of the effect depends on:

Albert Einstein predicted the possibility of gravitational lensing. The discovery that our Sun bends the light of distant objects when their light passes close to it was evidence that the general theory of relativity was correct.

There a three types of lensing:

Strong lensing betrays itself by producing multiple images from the same object. A well-known example is "Einstein's Cross" (Q2237+0305) at a distance of 8 billion lightyears. Here, the gravitational lens produces four images from the same object (a quasar), although it is only one object. The light of the quasar does not travel in a straight line to earth. Instead, it is bent along the gravitational field of a galaxy in front of it. This galaxy is at a distance of 400 million lightyears.

The first discovery of this kind (except the Sun) happened in 1979. Two quasars were close to each other. They both had the same spectrum and proved to be two images of the same quasar (Q0957+651). In 1980 scientists found out which group of galaxies functioned as the lens.

Weak lensing does not produce multiple images of the same object. Instead it produces a highly deformed or stretched image from an object far beyond the lens. In 1986 this was discovered in cluster Abell 370. Later it was understood that this was a greatly deformed image of a galaxy far beyond the cluster. 

The object can appear larger or smaller, as is shown in the table. Weak lenses allow us to observe very distant galaxies, which we would be unable to observe without such lens. By bending the light, the amount of light (magnitude) from the source increases. This way a very distant and faint galaxy can become visible, while we normally would not be able to observe it.

In cases of microlensing, there is no distortion in shape. However, the amount of light visible from an object changes periodically. This can be used to detect exoplanets. Light from a distant star is bent and enhanced by the gravitational field of a closer star. The presence of an exo-planet rotating around that closer star bends the light of the star farther away periodically. Object OGLE-2005-BLG-390-Lb, discovered 25 January 2006, is the first exoplanet detected by using microlensing.

Glen Hansard

Glen Hansard (born 21 April 1970 in Dublin, Ireland) is the principal songwriter and vocalist/guitarist for Irish rock group The Frames. He is also known for starring in the film Once and co-writing its Academy-Award-winning song, "Falling Slowly."

Hansard quit school at age 13 to begin busking on local Dublin streets. He formed The Frames in 1990, and they've been staples of the Irish music scene ever since. Their first album, "Another Love Song", was released on Island Records in 1991, and their most recent, "The Cost", was released in 2006.

Hansard first came to international attention as guitar player Outspan Foster in the 1991 Alan Parker film "The Commitments", after attending the New York Film Academy School of Acting. He has often stated that he regretted taking the role, because he felt it distracted from his music career.

In 2003, he presented the television programme "", which showcased Irish music talent on RTÉ. 

On 22 April 2006, he released his first album without The Frames, "The swell season", on Overcoat Recordings in collaboration with Czech singer and multi-instrumentalist Markéta Irglová, Marja Tuhkanen from Finland on violin and viola, and Bertrand Galen from France on cello. Hansard also spent part of 2006 in front of the cameras for a music-infused Irish film "Once", in which Hansard plays a Dublin busker, and Irglová an immigrant street vendor. The film had its American premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007 and received the Festival's World Cinema Audience Award. During the promotional tour, he and Irglová began dating. Said Hansard about his relationship with Irglova: "I had been falling in love with her for a long time, but I kept telling myself she's just a kid". One of the songs they wrote together for the film ("Falling Slowly") won an Oscar for Best Song in February 2008. Hansard became the first Irish-born person to win in that category. Hansard and Irglová also recorded a version of Bob Dylan's "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" for the film "I'm Not There" in 2007. In 2009, Hansard said that he and Irglova were no longer romantically linked, and that they are now "good friends."

Aside from his projects with The Frames and Irglová, Hansard also appeared as part of the band on the 2006 Oxfam charity album, "The Cake Sale". In addition, Hansard has recorded a few cover songs, both alone and with band member Colm Mac Con Iomaire, for the Today FM discs "Even Better than the Real Thing". Songs that he has recorded include Justin Timberlake's "Cry Me a River" on "Vol. 1" and Britney Spears' "Everytime" on "Vol. 2".

Outside music, he appeared on a "Simpsons" episode as a street musician in Ireland.

Hansard has remarked about his musical influences: "In my house, when I was a kid, there was the holy trinity, which was Leonard Cohen, Van Morrison and Bob Dylan with Bob sitting center."
Hansard and The Frames toured as the support act for Bob Dylan in Australia and New Zealand in August 2007 and Hansard often performs Van Morrison's songs in concert. "Into the Mystic" and "And the Healing Has Begun" were included on the collector's edition of the soundtrack for the film "Once".

MacBook Pro

A MacBook Pro is a type of laptop computer made by "Apple Inc." It replaced the PowerBook G4 and was the second Intel model to be released. It runs Mac OS X and comes with a built in webcam and microphone and a power adapter that is attached by magnets. MacBook Pros are currently housed in aluminum metal and are currently available in 13", 15" and 17" models.

The Macbook Pro was first introduced on January 2006 at the Macworld Expo.

The first MacBook Pro was the 15" model, but a 17" inch model was released later that year. New models were released in late 2006, late 2007, early 2008, late 2008, and early 2009. In June 2009, a 13" model was added and the other sizes were also updated. The next updates happened in April 2010 and February 2011.

The new MacBook Pro has several features:

The aluminum unibody case makes the MacBook Pro lighter, polished, and stronger. On the left side of the computer, there is a button next to many indicator lights. This button will turn on the lights. They say how much battery power the computer has left. More lights on means more battery.

A built-in battery gives around seven hours of power to all models of the computer. This battery can be recharged up to 1,000 times, whereas typical notebooks can only be recharged 200 to 300 times.

The new keyboard has curved and backlit keys.

The entire trackpad is a button, adding more space to the trackpad. Right-click can be done with two fingers or using a right-click area. Some gestures are:


Hard drive sizes range from 320 to 750 GB. One can use a Solid State Drive with a capacity of 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB to help improve battery life and performance.

The CPUs in the computers are either dual-core or quad-core Intel "Sandy Bridge" core i5 or i7 chips. A SD card slot in the 13" and 15" MacBook Pros can be used to quickly import photos from a camera or camcorder. The 17" MacBook Pro has an ExpressCard slot instead.

The GPU is part of the CPU and is called Intel HD Graphics 3000. The 15" and 17" models also have either a separate AMD Radeon HD 6490M or AMD Radeon HD 6750M.

The MacBook Pros have the following environmentally-friendly features:

Joan Geraldine Bennett (February 27, 1910 – December 7, 1990) was an Emmy-nominated American film actress who appeared in more than 70 Hollywood films from the silent era to talkies, from color to the advent of television and epic films. She may be best known and loved for her film noir femme fatale roles in films by director Fritz Lang. 

Joan Bennett had three distinct phases to her long and successful career, first as a winsome blonde ingenue, then as a brunette femme fatale and, finally, as a warm-hearted wife/mother figure.

Born in Palisades, N.J., she was part of a famous theatrical family with a lineage dating back to traveling minstrels in 18th century England. Her father was actor Richard Bennett, her mother, actress Adrienne Morrison, and her sisters, actress Constance Bennett and dancer, Barbara Bennett. Joan first acted onstage with her father at age 18 and by 19 had become a movie star courtesy of her roles in such movies as "Bulldog Drummond" (1929) and "Disraeli" (1929). She moved quickly from film to film throughout the 1930s, appearing with John Barrymore in his version of "Moby Dick" (1930) and playing Amy to Katharine Hepburn's Jo in "Little Women" (1933). Of the three Bennett sisters, Joan would achieve the greatest fame.

Contracted to 20th Century Fox, Joan Bennett appeared as a blonde ingenue in several films including "Puttin' on the Ritz" in 1930 and "Me and My Gal" in 1932, before leaving this studio to appear in "Little Women" (1933). The latter film brought Bennett to the attention of producer Walter Wanger, who signed her to a contract and eventually (in 1940) married her. 

Wanger managed Bennett's career, and with director Tay Garnett convinced her to change her hair from blonde (her natural color) to brunette. With this change her screen persona evolved into that of a glamorous seductive, femme fatale and she began to attract attention in a series of highly acclaimed film noirs by director Fritz Lang. During the search to find an actress to play Scarlett O'Hara in "Gone with the Wind", Bennett was tested and impressed producer David O. Selznick. She was briefly considered to be a front runner for this part but Selznick eventually turned his attention to Paulette Goddard, who was then rejected in favour of Vivien Leigh.

In the 1940s Bennett appeared in four films directed by Fritz Lang with whom she and Wanger had formed their own film company. Three of these films, "Man Hunt" (1941), "The Woman in the Window" (1945), and "Scarlet Street" (1945) established her as a film noir femme fatale and leading Hollywood actress. She also worked with noted directors Jean Renoir in "The Woman on the Beach" (1947) and Max Ophüls in "The Reckless Moment". Other highlights of the more mature phase of her career include the role of Spencer Tracy's wife and Elizabeth Taylor's mother in both "Father of the Bride" (1950) and "Father's Little Dividend" (1951).

In 1950, Bennett changed agents. In 1951 Wanger shot and injured Bennett's new MCA agent, Jennings Lang (1915-1996), with whom she had allegedly begun an affair. The resulting scandal hurt her career much more than Wanger's, according to the double standards toward women of the time. Wanger's attorney, Jerry Giesler, mounted a "temporary insanity" defense and Wanger served a four-month sentence at the Castaic Honor Farm two hours' drive north of Los Angeles, quickly returning to his film career to make a string of intelligent hit films. Bennett, meanwhile was forced to flee to Chicago to appear in theater, and later in television because the scandal was too great a stain on her film career and the film studios were already floundering in the 1950s as it was. Though Humphrey Bogart, a longtime friend of Bennett's, pleaded with the studios on her behalf to keep her role in "We're No Angels" following the shooting scandal, that film proved to be one of Bennett's last. Wanger and Bennett remained married until 1965. 

Bennett continued to work steadily in theatre and television and was a cast member of the television series "Dark Shadows" for its entire five year run, from 1966 until 1971, receiving an Emmy Award nomination for her performance therein. Bennett also appeared in a few more films, most notably the cult horror thriller from Italian director Dario Argento's "Suspiria". In the last decades of her life, she was married to David Wilde, a Yale graduate and film critic. Bennett died from a heart attack in Scarsdale, New York at the age of 80, and was buried in Pleasant View Cemetery, Lyme, Connecticut.

Joan Bennett was survived by 4 daughters (Diana Fox, Melinda Markey, and Shelley and Stephanie Wanger) and 13 grandchildren.

Bennett has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for services to Motion Pictures, at 6310 Hollywood Boulevard.

Rice Riots of 1918

The were riots where many of the citizens of Japan became upset and rebelled against the government that happened between July 1918 to September 1918. They caused the ending of the Terauchi Masatake government.

A very big rise in the price of rice caused very bad economic "(money)" problems, especially in rural areas "(outside of cities)" where rice was the main food of daily life for people. Farmers, became angry at the government (who set the amount of money the farmer's made) and the rice merchants when they learned that they were making much less money for growing the rice than it was being sold for to the public. They blamed the government and the merchants for letting the price of rice rise so high. The rise in the price of rice happened just at the worst point in the rapid rise in prices in many things such as food and rents that was happening just after World War I. This caused problems for the people of Japan. The Siberian Intervention made things worse because the government themselves bought lots of rice to feed their soldiers who were outside of Japan. This made the price of rice rise even more. The government didn't do anything to stop it and it spread to the towns and cities. 
The Rice Riots were the biggest, most violent and wide spread in modern Japanese history. The first protest happened in the small fishing town of Uozu, Toyama Prefecture, on 23 July 1918. Starting with peaceful petitioning, the protest quickly grew into riots, strikes, looting, incendiary bombings of police stations and government offices and into armed fights. By mid-September 1918, over 623 protests and or riots had happened in 38 cities, 153 towns and 177 villages, with over 2 million people taking part in them. 25,000 people were arrested, and 8200 were convicted of crimes. Punishments were given including minor fines and up to the death penalty.

Prime Minister Terauchi said he and his cabinet were to blame for the riots and they all on 29 September 1918.

People studying this part of Japanese history think that the riots and so the need for rice in some way may have caused the Japanese to grow their occupation of other countries. Evidence of this is thought to be the increase in rice production in Taiwan and Korea.

Hinduism in Bangladesh

Hinduism is the second largest religious affiliation in Bangladesh, covering over at least 14% of the population. In terms of population, the indpendent nation-state of Bangladesh is the third largest Hindu state of the world after the Republic of India and Nepali states, and hosts the world's largest minority population of Hindus of Bengali ethnic origin.

In nature, Bangladeshi Hinduism closely resembles the forms and customs of Hinduism practised in the neighbouring Indian state of West Bengal, with which Bangladesh (at one time known as East Bengal) was united with that country until the Partition of India in 1947. The river Ganges is a scared holy river which flows into the country from Bharat.

Partition of the Punjab

The Indian province of Punjab was created in 1947, when the Partition of India split the former Raj province of Punjab between the Republic of India and the new State of Pakistan. The mostly Muslim western part of the province became Pakistan's Punjab Province; the mostly Sikh and Hindu eastern part became India's Punjab state in 1966. Many Hindus and Sikhs lived in the west, and many Muslims lived in the east, and so the partition saw many people displaced and much intercommunal violence. Lahore and Amritsar were at the center of the problem, the British were not sure where to place them - make them part of India or Pakistan. The British decided to hand both cities to India, but because of a lack of control and regulation for the border, Amritsar became part of India whilst Lahore became part of Pakistan. Areas in west Punjab such as Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Gujrat, had a large Sikh population and many of the residents were attacked or killed by radical Muslims. On the other side in East Punjab cities such as Amritsar, Ludhiana, and Gurdaspur had a majority Muslim population in which many of them were wiped out by Sikh guerrillas who launched an all out war against the Muslims.

British Pakistani community

British Pakistanis (also Pakistani Britons) are people in the United Kingdom of Pakistani ancestry. The UK has the second largest overseas Pakistani population after Saudi Arabia. 

Pakistan came into existence in 1947, so documentation of the life of Pakistani Britons technically can only start from that year. However, Muslim immigrants from the part of British India now known as Pakistan, entered the British Isles as early as the mid-seventeenth century.

Following the Second World War and the break-up of the British Empire, Pakistani migration to the United Kingdom increased, specifically during the 1950s and 1960s, as Pakistan was a part of the Commonwealth.

The majority of the immigration began in the mid-1950s when manual workers were recruited to fulfil the labour shortage which resulted from World War II. Many people began immigrating from Pakistan-administered Kashmir after the completion of Mangla Dam in Mirpur in the late 1950s as well, that destroyed hundreds of villages and stimulated a large wave of migration. Up to 5,000 people from Mirpur (10% of the displaced) left for Britain.

In the years to come, many from Punjab began immigrating in the 1960s; they worked in the foundries of the English Midlands and a large number worked at Heathrow Airport as well. During the same time, medical staff from Pakistan were recruited for the newly formed National Health Service. Over 7,000 Pakistani doctors currently work for the NHS.

During the 1970s, a large number of East African Asians, who already held British passports, entered the UK after they were expelled from Kenya, Uganda and Zanzibar. The Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 and Immigration Act 1971 largely restricted any further primary immigration, although family members of already-settled migrants were still allowed.

Kacchu

Kacchu is a Japanese traditional armor. Japanese swords and scabbards are higher quality than swords from other countries. Therefore, Kacchu also needed to develop to protect the body from attack. "Kacchu" was also made to be worn by horses. It was made of leather, bronze and iron.
Among the "samurai" it was used only for protection. "Kacchu" is now often used in feasts, entertainment and festivals. It has become colorful, simple and luxurious. Because Japanese people are becoming interested in the samurai, "kacchu" is becoming more popular. "Kacchu" has a high popularity among couples on the birth of the boy. In marriage, a bridegroom wears a tuxedo or "hakama" but, recently there have been more men wearing "Kacchu". "Kanetsugu Naoe"’s(直江 兼続) "Kacchu" is especially popular. He was a strategist in the Warring State Period in Japan. He is also called the general "Kanetsugu Naoe" of Uesugi. "Kanetsugu Naoe" only loved one woman, "Osen"(お船) and did not have another wife in time of polygamy. Therefore, couples think they swear to love forever by wearing his "Kacchu". In fact, the "Kanji" for "love"(愛)　sticks out from his helmet. This "Kanji" has four different meanings: “personal grace of love”(仁徳愛), “people of love”(民衆愛), “"Aizenmyouou"”(愛染明王), and “"Atagoshinkou"”(愛宕信仰). “"Aizenmyouou"” means the hero who realizes sexual desires and “"Atagoshinkou"” means the religion of gods from Atago temple. 

When a boy is born, "Kacchu" is decorated on “"Tango no sekku"”(端午の節句), called “Children’s day”, is the festival which celebrates boy’s growing and children’s health. As charms, "Kacchu" and "Katana"(刀) are decorated on the inside with symbols which are meant to protect a boy’s body and soul.

Mad cow disease

Mad cow disease is the common name of "Bovine spongiform encephalopathy". It's a disease that affects a cow's nervous system. It comes from the chemistry structure of prion protein. When cattle get this disease, they have holes forming in their brains. The brain becomes spongy and begins to waste away. The cattle become very violent and show signs of mental disorder and have trouble when they move. It has a long incubation period, about 4~5 years. Cattle that are 4~5 years old can get the disease very easily.

It was not a common disease, but in 1996 the Minister of Health and Welfare in England said that it could be contracted by humans. Mad cow disease has damaged the cattle industry. Some food was made from cattle that had the disease. In the England, the nation that worst affected, more than 179,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million were killed in an attempt to get rid of the disease.

Last year, Korean President Lee's negotiations about the import of beef from the USA made the public angry. Many people went to the square in front of city hall and protested. It caused a lot of trouble, and the approval rating of the president sharply decreased. The government is working hard to protect people from the disease.

Galen

Galen of Pergamum (AD 129 – 199/217) was a prominent Roman physician and philosopher from Greece. He was an important medical researcher during the time of the Roman Empire. His theories influenced Western medical science for over a thousand years.

He came up with the 'Theory of Opposites' based upon Hippocrates' 'Four Humours' theory, which helped develop medicine in the Roman and again in the Middle Ages to include more natural based medicine (rather that just religious medicine). Also, in the Middle Ages, after the Dark Ages, Galen was upheld as the 'Official Doctor of the Church', due to a 'Creator' being mentioned in his books.

Some of his observations in his books were wrong, as he could only dissect animals and compare them to humans, so later on in the Renaissance period people such as Vesalius challenged his theories and observations with his own books.

Galen was vital in the beginnings of natural medicine, and is often known as the 'Father of Anatomy'.

The Deoksu Palace(Deoksugung ; 덕수궁, 德壽宮), is one of the five grand palaces of the Korean Joseon Dynasty.

When the Japanese invaded Joseon in 1592, King Seonjo escaped from Hanyang (present-day Seoul) and fled to Uiju. When the war finished, he returned to Seoul.
But there was no place for him to stay, because all of the palaces(such as Gyeongbok Palace, Changdeok Palace, Changgyeong Palace) had burned down during the war.

So, he lived in this place, which was originally the home of Prince Wolsandaegun who was King Seongjong's elder brother.

King Gwanghaegun who succeeded King Seonjo renamed this palace Gyeongun Palace (Gyeongungung ; 경운궁).
The palace became a secondary royal residence after the king moved to Changdeok Palace.
Queen Dowager Inmok was confined to the palace, and it was renamed West Palace(Seogung ; 서궁).
After he was overthrown by King Injo, it was returned to itsoriginal owners.

After two years, King Gojong returned to power and he chose to reside in this palace.
He renamed this palace Gyeongun Palace again.
An electrical system and fencing were installed at the palace, and the name of the palace was changed to Deoksugung Palace: meaning the palace of virtuous longevity.
He remained at the palace even after he had relinquished the throne to his son, Emperor Yunghui (or Emperor Sunjong ; 융희제, 순종)

From 1910 until 1945, when Korea was under the colonial rule of Japan, the palaces's buildings were destroyed and made into a public park.

Suwonhwaseong means "Hwaseong Fortress" in Korea, Suwon-si. Hwaseong Fortress was constructed as an act of filial devotion by Jeongjo, the 22nd king of the Joseon Dynasty (1392~1910), and to strengthen his power, eradicate party conflict, and fortify the southern area of the capital. Construction was started along Mt. Paldalsan in January 1794 and completed in September 1796 under the supervision of Chae Jae-gong, a former minister and the magistrate of Yeongjungchubu County. During construction, equipment such as the Geojunggi, a type of traditional Korean crane, and potters’ wheels were developed and used to transport and assemble large stones. 

The fortress suffered partial damage during Japanese colonial rule and the Korean War, but most of its original features have been restored with the help of the Hwaseong Seongyeokuigwe, the construction archive published in 1801 after the fortress was completed. 
The fortress sprawls over both flat and hilly terrain, something seldom seen in neighboring China and Japan. It is designed to serve political and commercial as well as military functions and is a fine example of oriental fortresses.

There are some stories about the origin of tteokguk. Some say that "The first day of year should be solemn and clean, so people eat white colored food". And others suggest "People hope for pureness and longevity by eating tteokguk." There is also a popular saying that "eating tteokguk on New Year's day makes you grow one year older" - the Korean equivalent of "a pinch to grow an inch!" perhaps.

Nail art

Nail art is a creative activity that draws pictures or designs fingernails. It a type of art. These days fingernails and toenails are seen by some as important points of beauty.

Also, it is a type of fashion activity, related to manicuring. There are commercial shops ('nail bars') where nails are worked on to make them attractive. The main product is acrylic nails with ready-made designs which can be stuck on top of natural nails. 

The artificial nails are not a replacement, but an extension for natural nails. There are two main approaches to creating artificial nails—"tips" and "forms". 

This is a mixture of a powder and a liquid. The mixture starts to harden in 30-40 seconds after application and gets to its final hardness in fifteen minutes. Powder and liquid acrylics can be removed by using a variety of solvents (usually acetone is used). Usually it takes 15 to 20 minutes to remove the nail.

Another material, commonly called "UV Top Coat" (in correct terms a polymer resin), hardens under ultraviolet light. These can show a wider range of properties (flexibility, strength, etc.) but may be more expensive. They cannot be removed by organic solvents, but only by filing (or left to grow out with the natural nail).

Another popular alternative to acrylic or gel preparations are fiberglass or silk wraps. They are done by cutting pieces of actual fiberglass or silk fabric to fit on the surface of the nail or tip and then it is sealed down with a resin or glue. These are an alternative for those who are allergic to chemicals used in the acrylic or gel process. Other materials can be used, as well as combinations of them. There are also temporary, cheaper flexible tips that can be quickly glued at home without help from a professional.

Acrylic nail powders are available in a variety of colours and can use "special effects" such as contours, sparkles and the very popular "French manicure" (pink and white appearance).

Guitar players, if they don't use their fingertips, use their nails, or a 'pick' (piece of metal) to play. If they use their nails, the nails must be in perfect condition, and kept to the same length all the time. Alternatively, he may use acrylic stick-ons. Every guitarist has his own way.

The players of many ancient Chinese instruments, like the guqin, pipa, and ruan, also commonly used artificial nails.

Gyeongju (경주) is a coastal city in the southeastern corner of North Gyeongsang province in South Korea. It is the second largest city in the province (Andong is the first largest city). It is large, with 269,343 people living in the city, according to the 2008 census. From southeast, Gyeongju is away from Seoul, and from the east, away from the provincial capital, Daegu.

Many low mountains are around the city. They are part of the Taebaek range.

Gyeongju was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla (57 BC – 935 AD). Silla ruled most of the Korean Peninsula between the 7th and 9th centuries, and many archaeological sites from that time are still in the city. This is why Gyeongju is often called "the museum without walls".
For example, Gyeongju Historic Areas and Yangdong Folk Village were made World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. The many important historical sites have helped Gyeongju become one of the most popular places in Korea for tourists.

In 1995, the city of Gyeongju and Gyeongju County were put together. There are 53 other small and medium-sized cities with about 300,000 or less people in South Korea. Today, Gyeongju is not only influenced by its history—it is influenced by the economic, demographic and social changes in South Korean culture. Its economy is mostly based on tourism. Manufacturing has also developed because Gyeogju is near large industrial cities such as Ulsan and Pohang. It is also connected to railways and highways that are often used by tourists.

Coco Chanel

Gabrielle Bonheur "Coco" Chanel (19 August 1883 – 10 January 1971) was French fashion designer. She was a founder of the House of Chanel. She was a leader of women's fashion in the 20th century. She was the only fashion designer to be named on TIME Magazine's 100 most influential people of the 20th century. 

In her youth she had been a seamstress (sewed clothes) and a night-club singer. After opening boutiques in Paris and Deauville, Coco eventually became a licenced "couturiere" (dress designer & maker) in 1919.

Her styles were simple, practical, and expensive. They included beautifully-made suits for women, and classic dresses. Her 'litttle black dresses' from the 1920s were famous, and are still copied today. She also designed accessories, such as a handbag with a shoulder strap that left the wearer's hands free.

A short-list of triumphs which are taken for granted today:

She was the mistress of a number of rich men, and reputedly turned down marriage to the Duke of Westminster. When asked why she did not marry him, she said: "There have been several Duchesses of Westminster. There is only one Chanel". She never married. 

Coco lived at the Hotel Ritz, Paris, for over thirty years. She was there during World War II, when the Germans occupied Paris, and her shops were closed. Her affair with a Nazi officer put her in an awkward position after the war, when she was accused of being a collaborator. Apparently, the British Royal Family intervened to get her released. She promptly moved to Switzerland, and gave up fashion. Coco did return to Paris and the fashion world, in 1954. The French ignored her, but she was still a star to the Americans and British, who bought steadily almost everything she designed. Her fame rests not just on her dress sales, but on the many design styles which influenced other designers, and were copied by many of them.

Her life has proved fascinating to theatre, film and television:

The House of Chanel is still in business, and still a member of the "Chambre syndicale de la haute couture", the top fashion clique in Paris. They do modern versions of many of Coco's best ideas.

Sejong the Great

Sejong the Great (May 6, 1397 – May 18 1450) was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty. He is one of the only two Korean kings called "great" (the other is Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo). He picked out young scholars and tried to fix the prejudice of classes by helping intelligent but low-class prodigies. In 1442, he had Jang Young-Sil, a scientist in Joseon, invent the 'Chuk-Oo-Gi (測雨器)'. This was a kind of tool to help measure the rain and how much it fell. Also, he expanded the territory of Joseon. 

One of the best works and the biggest reason why Sejong was called great was because he created the Hoon min jung um (訓民正音). It is called in modern days as 'Han-gul (한글)'. Because of the creating of Hoon min jung um, Joseon (now Korea) had now its own letters. And many of the people can use letters more easily than before.

Sejong was the third son of King Taejong. When he was twelve, he became grand prince and married Shim On of Cheongsong. When he was young, he was very good at studying. His father liked him more than his other brothers.

His older brothers, Yangnyeong and Hyoryeong, thought they were not fit to be king and that it was their duty to make Sejong the king, even though he was younger than them. So they acted rudely and badly in front of the court and were soon . Yangnyeong became a traveler who wandered in the mountains, and Hyoryeong became a Buddhist monk. This later became a heartfelt and traditional legend in South Korea.

<doc id="187186" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187186" title="Kabuki">
Kabuki

Kabuki is the traditional Japanese classical drama which started about 400 years ago. It is known for its very stylized acting and the elaborate makeup worn by the actors. The word kabuki means "singing and dancing". It also means strange and different, to be outside what is normal. Kabuki is not meant to look like real life. People from around the world are now interested in Kabuki. It was recognized by UNESCO in 2006 as an important part of Japan's cultural history.

Kabuki theater started during the Edo period (1603—1868), but it really developed into what we now know as kabuki during the "Genroku" (1688—1704). Kabuki was started by a woman, Izumo no Okuni, who performed in the dry river bed in Kyoto in 1603. It was very popular, especially because many of the stories and dance moves were about sex. Many of the women performers were probably prostitutes. Women were banned from performing in Kabuki plays in 1629 because it was thought to disturb discipline. They were replaced by beautiful young men to play the female roles, but in 1652 they were banned for the same reasons as the women. Kabuki was allowed to continue with adult men playing all the roles, Yaro kabuki, which is the style that has became famous.

After the "Genroku" era, Kabuki became popular in Japanese cities, growing rapidly as proper theater due to great authors and actors. "Ningyo Jyoruri" (the puppet theater) also influenced the stories, directions, content and rich style. Ballet and theater music, such as "Nagauta", "Tokiwadubushi" and "Kiyomotobushi" were also influences on the development of kabuki. After the restoration of the emperor in 1888, kabuki was influenced by foreign culture, and it was stimulated by new theater such as rise of new drama. 

In "Showa" period, from 1926 to 1989, performances began in other countries. Also the Empire Theater was reconstructed, and called the National Theater. In 1954, East Side Theater was made, and Kabuki stage relied on TV. In 1965, Kabuki was seen as an important cultural heritage. After World War II, the Japanese came to see that Kabuki as an important part of their culture. Many famous actors became famous people in Japan.

Kabuki theaters are very unique. In the Genroku era, kabuki was influenced by "nou" or "kyougen" which were the theater styles made before "kabuki". In this period there was no roof for audiences, so that if it rained, actors could not perform. In the Edo period, all seats were covered with a roof. 

"Mawari-butai", a revolving stage, began in the Kyōhō era (1716–1735). Scenes are built on the revolving stage and when a new scene is needed they simply rotate the stage; it makes progress of plays move quickly and easily. Foreign theaters have copied this kabuki invention. 

Other unique system is "hanamichi" or "flower path". This is a walkway which crosses the auditorium at the same height as the stage. Actors can use this walkway to enter or leave the stage. During a play it can become many kinds of places. For example, it can be a river, a road, a corridor and so on.

The most famous theatre in Japan is the "Kabuki-za". It was built in Tokyo in 1889. It was built as western-style theater. The interior decorations were Japanese style but the outside was brick walls and it was a three-storied theater at first. The interior decorations and outside changed many time. Kabuki theaters have long histories and these were so unique.

Woman kabuki actors are rare though there was "onnakabuki". The "onnakabuki" is woman’s kabuki. But women performing kabuki was believed to corrupt public morals. The shogunate prohibited the woman from performing in 1629. And kabuki actors became only the men in 1652. Now the men play both male and a female roles.

There are a lot of famous kabuki actors in Japan such as Danjuro Ichikawa, Ebizo Ichikawa and Koshiro Matsumoto. Danjuro Ichikawa is especially famous kabuki actor. He started "aragoto" at the age only of 14. The "aragoto" is a kabuki genre dealing with a brave warrior, a fierce god, or a demon. He also wrote kabuki plays under the name of Hyogo Mimasuya.

The name of a kabuki actor usually is passed on from one generation to the next. Therefore the name of an actor is passes to the next generation. Kabuki actors do not perform only kabuki but also act in TV drama and movies. Koshiro Matsumoto often appears on TV.

Famous authors of kabuki plays include Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653—1724), Tsuruya Nanmboku (1755—1829), and Kawatake Mokuami (1816—1893). 

Kabuki plays can be put into three main groups "Jidaimono", "Sewamono" and "Shosagoto". The "Jidaimono" are plays which show the world of samurais or court nobles before the Edo period. The government banned performances that showed the history of the Edo period. "Sewamono" are plays about the lives of the town people in the Edo period. "Shosagoto" are plays that feature dance.

"Gidayu kyogen" or "Maruhonmono" are kabuki plays that were first written as puppet plays. They were turned into kabuki plays when they became famous. "Shin kabuki" are plays which were written by writers who did not normally write kabuki plays.

Kabuki makeup helps audiences understand each character's role. It is special and emphasizes beauty of form. If an actor plays the role of a daughter or a man in love, he must apply makeup. First, he rubs grease, which is made of canola oil and perfume, into his face. Second, he paints out eyebrow with grease. Third, he rubs face powder on chest, neck, long hair and spreads powder with sponge. Next, he rubs face powder on face with sponge. Also, he puts rouge on nose, eyes cheek and the outer corner of the eye. He paints his eyebrow from red to black and he rubs lip with red lip stick and traces the outline clearly. 

If the actor is playing a brave man, called "Aragoto", he paints on rouge with red and black lines, "Kumadori", to show brave feelings. "Kumadori" is a type of kabuki's make up. It was started in 1673 by Danjyurou Ichikawa. It shows the character's role, for example, "Sujiguma" is one of the "kamadori" showing a super hero.

Modern Japanese has a lot of words that came from kabuki wordss. For example, there are three famous words; the first is an "ohako". "Ohako" means skillful things. Japanese often say the "ohako" is own good tune with karaoke. The "ohako" is derived word from Danjuro Ichikawa. He kept the kabuki plays of his good kabuki in a box. The "ohako" originated in there.

The second is a "nimaime". The "nimaime" means a good-looking man. The "nimaime" was written secondarily from the right in the signboard of the kabuki. Therefore it came to be said so.

The third is a "sanmaime". The "sanmaime" means a comedian. The origin of this word is the same as "nimaime", "sanmaime" was written third from the right in the signboard of the kabuki. 

Now Kabuki actors often perform for foreign audiences. The group "Heisei Nakamuraza" directed by Nakamura Kanzaburou have become famous for their performances in foreign countries. They were the first traditional style kabuki group to perform in New York in 2004, with actor Nakamura Kankuro V. Using a tent as a playhouse near opera house, with the audience seated on tatami (Japanese mats), they performed "The Summer Festival: A Mirror of Osaka" with Japanese actors. In July 2008, "Heisei Nakamuraza" again performed in New York and they played in English. It was a historical and splendid achievement.

In Australia, the Za Kabuki group at the Australian National University has been performing a kabuki drama each year since 1976; the single longest regular kabuki performance outside of Japan.

Karl Böhm

Karl Böhm (born Graz, 28 August 1894; died Salzburg, 14 August 1981) was an Austrian conductor. He was one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, especially famous for his conducting of the music of Mozart, Wagner and Richard Strauss.

Böhm was born in Graz, Austria. He wanted to be a musician, but his father said that he should study law first, because musicians did not make much money, and if he was not successful as a musician he could then always have a job in law. So he studied law at the university of Graz, and got a doctorate on this subject. He also studied music privately in Graz, and then in Vienna with Eusebius Mandyczewski and Guido Adler. Although he learned to play the piano and to compose, he just wanted to be a conductor. He started his career by helping singers at the Graz Opera to learn their roles. Böhm became very interested in the operas of Wagner and Mozart and learned a lot from great conductors like Carl Muck and Bruno Walter who invited him to the Bavarian State Opera in 1921. In 1927 he became Generalmusikdirektor (music director) at Darmstadt. He often conducted modern operas, including Berg’s "Wozzeck". In 1931 he moved to Hamburg. In 1933 he conducted the Vienna Philharmonic, both in opera and concert performances. He became conductor at the opera house in Dresden when Fritz Busch lost that job because he said he did not like the Nazis. Böhm worked there for nine years. He became a great friend of the composer Richard Strauss and conducted the first performances of two of his operas there: "Die schweigsame Frau" and "Daphne". In 1943 got the very important job of conductor at the Vienna State Opera eventually becoming music director. He also conducted the German seasons at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires from 1950 to 1953.

In his later years Böhm spent his time as guest conductor. He was invited to conduct many of the leading world orchestras. He often performed at Salzburg, Bayreuth, Vienna, Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Milan, Paris and New York.
In 1957, he made his first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, conducting "Don Giovanni". He was very popular there and conducted many operas, especially those by Mozart, Wagner and Richard Strauss.

Late in life, he was a regular guest conductor with the London Symphony Orchestra. He was given the title of LSO President for the rest of his life.

During his last years his sight was not very good. He died in Salzburg in 1981.

Böhm was praised for his clear, energetic conducting. He did not have exaggerated mannerisms but got his orchestras to play with a warm, romantic sound which was never sentimental. Besides his favourite Mozart, Wagner and Richard Strauss he conducted many works by Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Bruckner, Brahms and Berg.

He was given many honours, including first Austrian Generalmusikdirektor. On his 80th birthday a big party was held, at which Herbert von Karajan gave him a clock.

It is a string instrument and is played by bowing or plucking the strings. It has a body made out of a solid piece of wood, with straight sides and a round back. The belly of the rebab is made of skin. The pegs used to tune the strings are like those on a violin, and are pushed into holes on the side of the peg box. The peg box is made from a separate piece of wood.

Sackbut

The sackbut is a brass musical instrument from the Renaissance which by the 1750's was developing into the modern trombone. It has narrower tubing, does not have a water key, a slide lock or a tuning slide that are found on trombones. It is played by buzzing the lips into a mouthpiece. The length of the instrument could be changed by the use of a sliding tube which meant it could play a full chromatic range of notes. The earliest instruments come from the 1500's. The sackbut was popular because it could be played loudly or softly, and it could also be played in tune. They were made in a range of sizes, a descant (rarely used), alto, tenor and bass. They were often played to accompany a church choir.

Boeing 727

The Boeing 727 is a medium sized airplane that used to be built by the North American company Boeing. It was built from 1963 to 1984; 1,831 of them were made. It first flew on February 1, 1963.

In August 2008, there were 81 Boeing 727-100 planes and 419 727-200 planes still flying.

The design of the 727 was thought up as a compromise between United Airlines, American Airlines, and Eastern Air Lines and their requirements for a jet plane to fly to smaller cities, many with shorter runways and less passenger demand than the 707, a bigger plane that was the only jet airplane made by Boeing at the time. United Airlines wanted a four-engined plane for flights to high-altitude airports, especially its hub at Stapleton International Airport at Denver, Colorado. American, which was flying the four-engined Boeing 707 and 720, wanted a two-engined aircraft to save gas. Eastern wanted a third engine for its overwater flights to the Caribbean, since at that time twp-engined commercial flights were limited by regulations to routes with 60-minute maximum flying time to an airport (see ETOPS/LROPS). Eventually, the airlines agreed on a trijet, which became the 727. The third JT8D engine, which is located at the end of the fuselage, or body of the plane (called engine 2), gets air from an opening at the front of the tail of the plane from an S-shaped duct that brings the air to the opening of the engine. The 727 design included high-lift devices on its wing, giving the plane more lift, which makes it fly. This made it one of the first jet planes able to be able to take off from shorter runways. Later models of the 727 were stretched to hold more passengers, and they ended up replacing earlier jet airliners, such as the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, on shorter flights.

The PowerBook was a type of laptop computer built by Apple Computer, Inc. from 1991 to 2006. The PowerBook was changed many times in the time that it was made. Many times, the laptop was the first to have features that would later become common in other laptops. The PowerBook line was made for professional people. It got many awards. Examples are the 2001 Industrial Design Excellence Awards "Gold" status, and Engadget's 2005 "Laptop of the Year".

Before the PowerBook, Apple made the Macintosh Portable. At that time, third-party laptops that ran Macintosh software were also available, such as the Outbound Laptop. In 1999, Apple started making the cheaper iBook model. The PowerBook and iBook lines were discontinued (Apple stopped making them) and replaced by the MacBook family in 2006.

Kertész was born in Budapest. His family were Jewish. His father was director at a leather factory. When his father died of appendicitis in 1938, his mother had to go out to work to earn money. It was not easy at the time for women in Hungary to find work, but she was successful. István started to learn the violin when he was six, and after a few years he started learning the piano as well.

When the Nazis invaded Hungary during World War II his family had to hide. Most of them were found and taken to Auschwitz where they died.

After the war he graduated from school and went to the Royal Academy of Music (now the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest, where he studied violin, piano, and composition. Zoltán Kodály was one of his teachers. He soon became interested in conducting, and learned a lot from Bruno Walter, and Otto Klemperer, then the director of the Budapest Opera.

From 1953 to 1955, István Kertész conducted at Györ, and the Budapest Opera orchestra. After the 1956 uprising in Hungary he and his family left their country and went to Germany. He settled there and took German nationality.

Kertész became conductor at Augsburg (1958-1963) and then at Cologne. He first appeared in Britain in 1960 with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and then with the London Symphony Orchestra. He first conducted in America in 1961, touring with the Hamburg RSO. He conducted at Covent Garden in 1965, and then took over from Pierre Monteux as conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra.

Kertész had a very large repertoire and conducted nearly all of the world’s great orchestras. He conducted many operas, and was especially fond of the music of Bartok, Henze, Stravinsky and Britten. He gave the first Vienna performance of Britten’s "War Requiem" and the first performance in Germany of his opera "Billy Budd". He made many recordings.

The Fall of Constantinople was when the Ottoman Empire took over Constantinople, the capital city of the Byzantine Empire, on Tuesday, May 29, 1453. Many historians consider this event to be the end of the Byzantine Empire, although some places, like the Morea Despotate and Empire of Trebizond were not defeated by the Ottomans until several years later. The Fall of Constantinople had important results, because the Ottoman Turks finally had stable power in the Balkans and then nothing could stop them from their campaign on Europe, which did not stop until after the Battle of Vienna in 1683. After the fall of Constantinople and the Byzantine empire, many people escaped to Western Europe and helped create humanism and the Renaissance in Europe.

Wikipedia:Subpages

Except in "main" (=""), where the has been disabled in English Wikipedia, subpages are pages separated with a "/" (a slash) from their 'parent' page. 

Making a new "<nowiki>link</nowiki>" that begins with a / (slash) is the common way to start a subpage. The page to which this link points is considered "subordinate" to its host page, and is titled and linked as "<nowiki>Parentpage/Subpage</nowiki>". It is possible to create a subpage of a subpage (or a sub-subpage). At the top of each subpage or sub-subpage, you can find a backlink (aka breadcrumb) to the higher levels of the page.




To get a list of all subpages of a page, use and type the parent page name followed by a slash. For example, for all subpages of , type codice_1 in the search box and hit Go: .

The MediaWiki software supports selectively allowing or disallowing the creation of subpages in various . In namespaces where subpages are supported, you can create a subpage simply by linking to the name of the subpage, prefixed with a slash (e.g. <nowiki>/Archive</nowiki>). For Wikipedia, the User, Talk, and Wikipedia namespaces have subpages turned on; the main (article) namespace "does not" have this feature turned on, as strictly hierarchical organisation of articles is discouraged, and other distinctions are better made by placing pages in other namespaces (e.g. discussions go in "Talk:", and templates in "Template:").

Some topics have a slash in the name — "e.g." GNU/Linux naming controversy or OS/2. This is not a problem. If that's what the thing is called, use the slash. In article namespace this doesn't define a subpage.

Subpages were originally used on Wikipedia to differentiate between subjects to create topical hierarchies of articles, but this proved unworkable because articles tend to belong in more than one hierarchy. The present system of was adopted instead, and the "Wikipedia:Do not use subpages" policy had to be rigorously enforced, as well as retroactively applied. As of mid-2004, the supports hierarchical organization while still allowing an article to belong to multiple categories.

"Note that older discussions of subpages are generally concerned with articles named as subpages of other articles; this is no longer done."

The zones are also used for pricing London Underground and Docklands Light Railway single journeys, but not single journeys undertaken entirely by bus or tram, for which a system-wide flat fare applies.

Cyclone Tracy

Cyclone Tracy was a tropical cyclone that destroyed the city of Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia, from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day, 1974. It is the most compact tropical cyclone on record in Australia, with the gale force winds reaching out only from the centre. It is the second most compact cyclone in the world. Tropical Storm Marco of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season had gale-force winds reaching only from the centre. After forming over the Arafura Sea, the Tracy moved south and hit the city with Category 4 winds on the Australian cyclone scale. It is possible that it had reached Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale when it made landfall.

Tracy killed 71 people, caused $837 million in damage (1974 AUD) and destroyed more than 70% of Darwin's buildings, including 80% of the houses. Of the 49,000 people who lived in Darwin, 20,000 people were left homeless. More than 30,000 people had to leave the city. Most of Darwin's population were moved to Adelaide, Whyalla, Alice Springs and Sydney. Many people never returned to Darwin. The city was rebuilt using modern materials and updated building methods. Bruce Stannard of "The Age" stated that Cyclone Tracy was a "disaster ... without parallel in Australia's history."

<doc id="187866" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187866" title="Spearman's rank correlation coefficient">
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient

In mathematics and statistics, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is a measure of correlation, named after its maker, Charles Spearman. It is written in short as the Greek letter "rho" (formula_1) or sometimes as formula_2. This means that it is a number that shows how closely two sets of data are linked. It only can be done on data that can be put in order, highest to lowest.

The general formula for formula_2 is formula_4.

For example, if you have data for how expensive different computers are, and data for how fast the computers are, you could see if they are linked, and how closely they are linked, using formula_2.

To work out formula_2 you first have to "rank" each piece of data. We are going to use the example from the intro of computers and their speed.

So, the computer with the lowest price would be rank 1. The one higher than that would have 2. Then, it goes up until it is all ranked. You have to do this to both sets of data. 

Next, we have to find the "difference" between the two ranks. Then, you multiply the difference times itself, which is called squaring the number. The difference is called formula_7, and to show when you square formula_7, you write formula_9. 

Count how much data we have. This data has ranks 1 to 5, so we have 5 pieces of data. This number is called formula_10. 

Finally, use everything we have worked out so far in this formula: formula_11.

formula_12 means that we take the total of all the numbers that were in the column formula_9. This is because formula_14 means total.

So, formula_12 is formula_16 which is 4. The formula says multiply it times 6, which is 24.

formula_17 is formula_18 which is 120.

So, to find out formula_2, we simply do formula_20.

Therefore, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is 0.8 for this set of data.

formula_2 always gives an answer between −1 and 1. The numbers between are like a scale, where −1 is a very strong link, 0 is no link, and 1 is also a very strong link. The difference between 1 and −1 is that 1 is a positive correlation, and −1 is a negative correlation. A graph of data with a formula_2 value of −1 would look like the graph shown except the line and points would be going from top left to bottom right.

For example, for the data that we did above, formula_2 was 0.8. So this means that there is a positive correlation. Because it is close to 1, it means that the link is strong between the two sets of data. So, we can say that those two sets of data are "linked", and go "up" together. If it was −0.8, we could say it was "linked" and as one goes up, the other goes down.

Sometimes, when ranking data, there are two or more numbers that are the same. When this happens in formula_2, we take the mean or average of the ranks that are the same. These are called "tied" ranks. To do this, we rank the tied numbers as if they were not tied. Then, we add up all the ranks that they would have, and divide it by how many there are. For example, say we were ranking how well different people did in a spelling test. 

These numbers are used in exactly the same way as normal ranks.

Leadbeater's Possum

Leadbeater's Possum ("Gymnobelideus leadbeateri") is an endangered species of Australian possum. Once thought to be extinct, it is now only found in small areas of surviving old and mixed age mountain ash forest in the central highlands of Victoria, Australia, north-east of Melbourne. About half this area was burnt out in the disastrous Black Saturday bushfire in 2009. Large areas of the forest around Marysville, Narbethong and Healesville were destroyed. They need food all year, and trees with holes where they can hide during the day. This limits them to mixed-age wet sclerophyll forest with a thick mid-story of "Acacia". 

It is the only species in the Gymnobelideus genus. It was named after John Leadbeater, a taxidermist at the Museum of Victoria. 

It is the only mammal that is only found in Victoria, so in 1968, the State of Victoria made Leadbeater's Possum its faunal emblem.

The possum was first discovered by Europeans in 1867. Only five possums were found, the last one in 1909. It was thought the species was extinct, because its habitat around Bass River in south-west Gippsland was cleared for farming in the early 1900s.

In 1961, a group was discovered near Marysville, in the Upper Yarra Valley. Further searching found more groups in the highlands of Victoria. However, type of forest is critical: it can not be too old or too young.

The possum's survival is believed to be due to the terrible Black Friday fires that burnt through Victoria in 1939. This created a lot of new growth in the forest which provided food. It also left a lot of large dead trees for shelter and nesting. The Leadbeater's Possum population grew to about 7500 in the early 1980s. After the 2009 fires it is believed that there are now only about 1000 possums left. Many of the old trees have decayed and there is little new growth. Before European settlement, the possums would simply have moved to new recently burnt areas, but with so much land cleared in the last 100 years, they now have nowhere else to go.

If a population of about 1000 can survive for another 150 years, natural tree hollows will begin to develop in the trees that started growing after the 1939 fires and which survived the 2009 fires. This should help possum numbers start to increase again.

Leadbeater's Possums are rarely seen. They sleep during day and come out at night (nocturnal). They are small, about long and weigh about 90 grams, about the size of a small rat. They move very quickly and live at the top of some of the tallest forests in the world. The possum is covered in thick, soft fur. It can be grey through to brown in colour, with a black stripe along their backs. Their fur on the chest and stomach area is pale grey. One of the main features of the possum is its club shaped tail.

They live in small family groups of up to 24 individuals, usually a breeding pair, their children, and sometimes an extra male or two. They sleep together in a nest made out of bark in a tree hollow. The nests can be anywhere from to above the ground. They have a territory of up to 20,000 square metres, which they will defend from other possums. The oldest female is the most aggressive. She will attack outsiders and chase her own daughters out of her territory when they become adults at about 14 months of age. The average female lifespan in the bush is only about 27 months, but as much as 10 years in captivity.

Leadbeater's Possums do not survive by themselves. Young males leave their parents at about 15 months of age and join another group, or live together in large male groups looking for females to start new groups.

At sunset, Leadbeater's Possums leave their nests and go out to find food in the tree tops. They often take huge leaps from tree to tree. They are omnivorous, they eat a range of tree saps, lerps, and arthropods which they find under the loose bark of eucalyptus trees such as spiders, crickets, and beetles. They get their energy from the sap and their proteins from the arthropods.

They give birth at the beginning of winter (May and June) or late spring (October and November). They have one or two babies, which stay in the pouch for 80 or 90 days. When they come out of the pouch they stay in the nest for another three weeks. Young Leadbeater's Possums are often eaten by owls.

Because of the small area where they live, and the mix of forest trees that they need, the Leadbeater's Possums is an endangered species. Logging continues to be a major threat to the possum. In 1993 five hectares of protected habitat east of Powelltown, was logged because of a "mapping error." Author, Peter Preuss, said that the number of possums dropped in 1997 with their current habitat (limited to a 50-square-kilometre area) under threat from logging. He said that there needed to be a new breeding program. 

Dr. David Lindenmeyer, (Australian National University), has said that the need to make nest boxes showed that logging was removing too many older trees with hollows needed by species like Leadbeater's Possum. Studies have shown that logging in the forest between the Yarra Valley National Park and Mount Bullfight Conservation Reserve in February 2006, led to the deaths of most possums in the area. Adult possums are territorial and do not want to move.. Many more were killed early in 2007 when VicForests cleared large firebreaks through possum habitat after the Christmas fires. Firebreaks and cleared land stop the possums from being able to travel and breed with other nearby groups.

With its much of its known habitat destroyed in the bushfires of February 2009 the species status is currently in doubt. The mapped distribution of the Leadbeater's possum exactly matches the area burnt in the fires.

The last Leadbeater's Possum in captivity died at Healesville Sanctuary Victoria in May 2006. There are now no Leadbeater's Possums in captivity anywhere in the world and no breeding program to assist this animal's survival. A group, Friends of Leadbeater's Possum, has formed to try an protect the possum and to make the government protect the habitat.

Red Faction: Guerrilla

Red Faction: Guerrilla is a third-person shooter video game made by Volition, Inc. and published by THQ, with the PC version being made by Reactor Zero. The game first came out on June 2, 2009 in North America for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. In the European countries it was released on June 5 2009 and the Microsoft Windows version will be released on August 25 2009. The game is the third game in the Red Faction series.

Red Faction: Guerrilla has a third person perspective, the first two games had a first-person perspective. This was changed because Volition though that the third-person view would be better because the player would be able to see more of the environment. In Red Faction: Guerrilla, the hero, Alec Mason, can run, jump, steal vehicles, and use weapons to explore the open world of Mars and fight the EDF (Earth Defense Force).

Red Faction: Guerrilla has gotten good reviews. The Metacritic score is 85/100. The GameSpot reviewer Randolph Ramsey gave the game a, 8.5/10. He said that the physics and the realism of the game were good, but also said that the game is repetitive and that the story was not good. IGN reviewer Charles Onyett gave the game an 8/10. He said that the game is fun, but that the storyline, graphics, and voice acting are weak.

<doc id="187989" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187989" title="Kennel cough">
Kennel cough

Kennel cough or tracheobronchitis is a very easily caught dog illness characterized by inflammation (redness and pain) of the upper airways. It can be caused by viral infections such as canine distemper, canine adenovirus, canine parainfluenza virus, or canine respiratory coronavirus, or bacterial infections such as "Bordetella bronchiseptica". It is called kennel cough because the infection can spread very quickly among dogs, such as in the closeness of a kennel.

Both viral and bacterial causes of kennel cough are spread through the air by infected dogs sneezing and coughing. It can also be spread through contact with things that have the bacteria or virus on them. It can still be spread days or weeks after symptoms disappear. Symptoms begin usually 3 to 5 days after exposure. The disease can become pneumonia.

Symptoms can include a , dry coughing, , sneezing, , or vomiting in response to light pressing of the trachea or after excitement or exercise. The symptoms are caused by the inflammation of the airways. It can increase after excitment or exercise because of the quick breathing that takes place which causes the nerves of airway to become more stimulated. A fever is not always present. The disease can last 10-20 days and can come back when the dog is put into a stressful situation which puts stress on the dog's immune system. Medical diagnosis is made by seeing these symptoms, having a history of exposure is also helpful but not always found as kennel cough is easily spread through contact with the ground, toys, sidewalks, dog parks.

Antibiotics are given to treat any bacterial infection present. Cough suppressants are used if the cough is not productive (nothing is being coughed up). The usual outcome is good. Prevention is by vaccinating for canine adenovirus, distemper, parainfluenza, and "Bordetella". In kennels, the best prevention is to keep all the cages clean. Most kennels will not board dogs without proof of vaccination.

Ethelbert Nevin

Ethelbert Woodbridge Nevin (born near Pittsburgh, 25 November 1862; died New Haven, Connecticut, 17 February 1901) was an American pianist and composer. He is remembered for a small number of romantic songs and piano pieces which became extremely popular in the early 20th century.

Nevin was born in 1862, at Vineacre, on the river Ohio, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He grew up there. His father was a newspaper editor and he taught the young boy most subjects. His mother played the piano. The family bought a grand piano, which was the first grand piano ever to be taken across the Allegheny Mountains. 

Ethelbert showed musical promise when he was very young. His brother and cousins were also musical. When he was four he was playing the piano with cushions on the floor so that he could reach the pedals. His father took him to Dresden for two years to study music. He also studied in Pittsburgh and in Boston.

He started his career giving piano lessons. When he had earned enough money he went to Berlin where he had lessons from Karl Klindworth, who was a good teacher for him. He showed Nevin how important it was to have a good general knowledge, and not just to spend hours and hours practising the piano. This helped Nevin, who had good tastes in literature and he chose some good poems to make into songs.
In 1885 he was invited to join a group who had lessons from Hans von Bülow. He played works by of Brahms, Liszt, and Raff. Cosima Wagner and Joseph Joachim often came to the concerts given by this group.

In 1887 he went back to America and lived in Boston, where he taught and played in some concerts. He asked Richard Strauss to teach him composition but Strauss did not accept him.

In 1892 he went to Paris, where he taught singing, and helped many American and French opera singers to learn their parts for singing in operas. He worked very hard and his health got bad. He spent his last years in several European places and then he went back to America. He died in 1901.

Nevin's music is romantic, and sometimes rather sentimental for modern tastes. His best known piece is "Narcissus" from "Water Scenes". These pieces were used by the dancer Isadora Duncan to dance to. He also wrote a famous song called "The Rosary" and "Mighty Lak' a Rose".
Nevin was pictured on a 1940 ten cent U.S. postage stamp.

Eucalyptus regnans

Eucalyptus regnans, also called Mountain Ash, Victorian Ash, Swamp Gum, Tasmanian Oak or Stringy Gum, is a species of "Eucalyptus" from Victoria and Tasmania. It can grow to more than and is the tallest flowering plant in the world. 

It is an evergreen tree, the tallest eucalyptus tree, growing 70-120 m (230-400 feet) tall. It has a straight, grey trunk with smooth bark. The leaves are narrow, curved, and end in a point, like a sickle. They grow up to long and wide. They are green to grey-green with a red stalk. The flowers are in groups of 9-15 together, each flower about 1 cm (0.5 in) diameter with a ring of many white stamens. The fruit is a hard nut, up to 9 mm (0.5 in) long and 7mm (0.4in) wide.

Mountain Ash are found in cool, deep soiled, mountain areas to above sea level, with high rainfall of over each year. They grow very quickly, at more than a metre (3 feet) a year, and can reach in 50 years. They live for an average life-span of 400 years. The fallen logs continue supporting a rich variety of life for centuries more on the forest floor.

Unusually for a eucalypt, Mountain Ash does not regrow after fire. They grow only from seed which are released from their woody gumnuts by heat. The seedlings need a lot of light, much more than reaches the forest floor normally when there are mature trees blocking the sun. Severe fires can kill all the trees in a forest, which causes a massive release of seed to take advantage of the nutrients in the ash bed. Up to 2.5 million seedlings per have been recorded after a major fire. Competition and natural thinning slowly reduces the number of mature trees to about 30 to 40 per hectare. Because it takes roughly 20 years for seedlings to reach become old enough to make seeds, repeated fires in the same area can cause local extinctions. If, however, there are no fires to release seeds, the trees die off after about 400 years and are replaced by other species. 

"Eucalyptus regnans" is the tallest of all flowering plants, and possibly the tallest of all plants, although no living trees can make that claim. The tallest tree, named "Centurion", stands 99.6 metres tall in Tasmania. There are 16 living trees in Tasmania that have been measured taller than 90 metres. The tallest tree ever found was the "Ferguson Tree", at 132.6 metres, found in the Watts River region of Victoria in 1872. It had fallen over and was measured by William Ferguson, the Inspector of State Forests. The top of the tree had broken off, but the trunk was still more than one metre in diameter. Ferguson guessed the tree would have been more than 152 metres in height.

"Eucalyptus regnans" is valued for its timber, and large areas of trees have been cut down. The main uses are building timber and woodchipping. It also used for newsprint in the 20th century. Most of the woodchips are sent to Japan. While the area of natural stands with large old trees is rapidly decreasing, large areas of new trees exist. It is increasingly grown in plantations where the long, straight, fast growing trunks are more valuable than the old growth timber.

The timber is rather rough (stringy) in texture. It is easy to work and the grain is straight with long, clear sections without knots. The wood works reasonably well for steam-bending. It is used for furniture, flooring, woodpanelling, veneer, plywood, window frames and general building.

Next up for the QandA interview is , with guest interviewer . Lets see how he gets on...

I'm a university student from near Manchester, UK, training to be a primary school teacher
The fact there's always something to do. You can never get bored with it.
I knew about Wikipedia for ages, but had no idea you could actually edit it. Then in April 2006, a friend of mine showed me a page they created on Uncyclopedia. And I thought to myself - I can make a better page! So I did, and was rather sad that I didn't create an account beforehand, so I could be credited with it. The page has long since been deleted.

Moving on, I joined Wikipedia in June 2006 - remembering Uncyclopedia, I noticed there were some people missing from the list of left-handed people page. So I created my account, and using my Schott's Miscellany, I added three people. Using the minor edit button, and perfect wiki-markup! But I did not cite my source and I had not mastered the edit summary yet. What really sucked me in was editing Big Brother articles - these introduced me to talk pages, wikiprojects, admins, AFD, RFA... pretty much everything I know about Wikipedia stems from those early days on the Big Brother articles. Ah, the memories. I joined Simple English Wikipedia a few months later, when I began to explore English Wikipedia's sister projects. I also joined Meta-wiki around that time too.

Quite long, yes.

There isn't a lot of difference, except on smaller projects, admins have a lot more control as the proportion of admins to regular editors is higher. It's all the same though really.

I would have to say the people who spoil it: vandals, POV pushers, and anti-social people.

I'd like all editors to have an account, and not edit through an IP. There are many more things I'd like to change too, but if I had just one, I'd pick that

No

Well thanks for that Majorly! Look out for more QandA interviews in future editions!

Hi all. :) This is my very first article here and I wish to introduce myself. I am from and learnt about this ‘pedia from a userbox at a userpage. I came here on April, but my first edit was on last month to J.K.Rowling. Since then, I have made 1000 changes and am in love with this project

First, I want to talk about . DYK is a part of Simple Wikipedia which I have seen to improve greatly in the short period I have been here. When I came, we had disputes whether we had the man-power to make 3/5-days update. But, I have seen several improvements to it since then and by now, in spite of and ’s inactivity, we have managed 5 day updates. We now have 5(!) queues, 3 of which are now full. I invite all users to join us in improving it further. :)

Also, P(V)GA needs your help. Just the other day, we received only 4 votes in the PVGA of Ludwig van Beethoven. Also, Wijerd Jelckama which was a PGA was actually a copy-paste from enWP. We must take these things into consideration. We need to work on the rules of PVGA and PGA. We need your help for this. :)
List of London Underground stations is a proposed VGL. Please create few red links.

Finally, we have 59,736 articles now, just 264 short of 60,000. I hope we can create several more articles and can become a big wiki. We just need all of your help and support for this.

Bye,    14:42, 20 June 2009 (UTC).

Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon

Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon is the 4th Destroy All Humans! in the series first released December 1, 2008 in North America for the Xbox 360. The game is made by THQ's Sandblast Games studio for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon has around 30 story missions, 20 side quests, and multiplayer modes. As with previous games in the series, most story missions can be played in any order. Creative director Jon Knoles said that the side quests would have something to do with the story.

The player plays as Crypto, an alien. He can shoot humans, use the jet pack, and use Psychokinesis at the same time. There are now flying enemies, like helicopters and Nexo UFO's that can attack Crypto while he is in his UFO. Buildings can be destroyed and scarred in different ways when attacked with different weapons. The game has a new alert scheme with police, SWAT, military awareness, and Nexo alert. Electricity goes through power lines when damage is caused to them. The player can exit and enter some buildings during some missions.

The game was given 34/100 by the site Metacritic.

Template:Alternating rows table section/doc

Alternating rows table section allows for the dynamic creation of tables that use alternating styles for odd and even numbered rows, typically in conjunction with a template which generates a table where some rows may not be present every time.

The template produces only a portion of the table: this allows for the end user to customize the leading and trailing sections of the table, include secondary rows between sections, or other control elements. This table creates a new row at the start, and the user must start a new row if they want to include additional information after the table section.

There are two named arguments to this template:

Beyond these, the template accepts up to 30 unnamed parameters, the contents which are appropriate wikimarkup to create a table row as described below. A parameter may be left empty, and will not add to the current row count; in other words, the template tracks how may rows have been defined by the unnamed arguments to determine to apply the odd or even styling.

The unnamed arguments must start with a template-compatible table cell symbol, either "!" for a header, or the use of to create the standard cell indicator "|". An argument can contain multiple cells, either separated on lines (using to separate cells) or on a single line (using to replace "||" delimiters); cell-specific style arguments can also be applied. 

Unpredictable results may happen using other wikitable features such as rowspanning, creating a new row within an argument (using ), or the like.

The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run

The Simpsons Hit & Run is an action-adventure video game based on the animated sitcom (comedy TV show) "The Simpsons". It was released for the GameCube, Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Windows in the United States on September 16, 2003 and in Europe on October 31, 2003. The game was developed or made by Radical Entertainment and published or was put out to be sold by Vivendi Universal. To make the game harder and more fun the story and dialogue were written by the writers of the TV show. The voices were supplied by The Simpsons TV show actual cast.

The game follows the Simpson family and the people who live in Springfield, who see many strange things that happen in their town. When the Simpsons themselves decide to find out what is going on, they find out that aliens Kang and Kodos are filming a reality television series about the city. To make the show more interesting, the aliens release Buzz Cola, a soda that makes people go crazy, into Springfield's water supply. With help from Professor Frink, Homer is able to destroy the aliens' spaceship, and Springfield and its people are returned to normal.

The game received mostly positive, or good reviews from video game critics. Praise was given mostly on how much the game is was like the show and its funny take on the "Grand Theft Auto III" video game. The game received the award for Fave Video Game at the 2004 Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards. More than three million copies of the game were sold as of June 2007. 

"Hit & Run" has seven levels, each with missions and a unique plot. The player can only move, or control one certain character in each level. he game's playable characters are Homer Simpson, Bart Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Marge Simpson, and Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. When walking, the playing character can walk, run, and perform many attacks: a normal kick, a jumping kick, and a smashing move. To drive, the player can either drive one of the many vehicles that are on the road, a feature taken from "Grand Theft Auto 3", or use a phone booth to choose a car. The game's driving missions are also similar to those of "Grand Theft Auto 3". In both games,the player races against other characters, gets items before a timer runs out, and wrecks other cars.

Hi guys! Here's my eighth article for Simple News. 

You may have noticed, I haven't been so active lately, this is because I am not really motivated to edit any more. I really can't see any improvement being made and this just saddens me. We've tried to start collaboration projects but it seems all of them have failed. 

I would therefore like to ask for a discussion about this on Simple Talk. We have to make a project that works, that's well organized and that has a specific aim. Maybe an anti-stub team whose aim is to make stubs into articles, or a simplification-team who simplifies articles or even just keep the collaboration-team whose objective is to make certain articles GAs and VGAs by sharing out the work. Please, this is an absolutely necessary thing, otherwise I don't see how we're going to make any progress. 

It's Summer, you'll probably be on holiday and that'll give you more free time to edit!

More to come from Simple news in the next editions!

Greetings, readers of the Simple English Wikipedia's "Simple News"!

I've not written a Simple News article for a while, and indeed have been slacking off on my Simple News duties! Unfortunately I have had my GCSE exams, but they are now over, and i'm back to normal activity levels :D, which also means that Simple News will be back up to it's old standards (I hope...) but that is only if you guys help and send things in! Anything is appreciated!

Secondly, i'd like to make an addendum to the last Issue of Simple News, when a couple of errors managed to creep in to the Issue. These were found in the QandA section which made out the was still retired, and the other was in the announcements, when a "Very" was omitted from the list of articles that were at VGA.

Simple 'Pedia has very much been on a slow down recently, and we need to try to get back up to our activity levels from a few months ago, when we frequently had 5 or 6 P(V)GAs at the relevant page - as I write this we have 1 PVGA and 2 PGAs. I've got a couple of articles i'm working on myself, and hope to have at least one of these on the PVGA page before the end of this week. Time will tell!

With us now being about half way through 2009, i've also had a look back at the predictions that I made in our . I must say, some of them were pretty accurate! Crich Tramway Village has made it to , the flood flag has been enabled, and GBots 3 and 4 have both been brought online - albeit with some problems, and not as was originally intended! There have also been no less than 16 Sysop promotions - of which one was mine and one was a re-promotion, 3 Bureaucrat promotions, and 2 CheckUser promotions. In addition, there has been one re-confirmation and one de-sysopping. (According to the RfA Archives page... I seem to remember there being another desysop somewhere...).

So, what holds for the rest of 2009? Only time can tell, but with the 60,000th article mark getting closer, Simple is certainly not a small and pointless wiki!

Finally, with regards to my current signature, let me make it known that I do not love Kennedy in the way that many have been thinking! It is merely a token of our good friendship, and how much his prescence on this wiki means to me and a lot of other editors.

I hope you all have a brilliant summer!

Hurricane Boris (1996)

Hurricane Boris was a deadly storm. It was the fourth cyclone of the 1996 Pacific hurricane season, formed on June 27. During the overnight hours, the depression became Tropical Storm Boris. Shortly thereafter, Boris rapidly strengthened into a hurricane. Just as an eye began to form, Boris made landfall in Mexico with peak winds of 85 mph (140 kn/h). It rapidly weakened and dissipated on July 1. Boris caused heavy flooding in southern Mexico. Ten deaths were reported. Damage is unknown.

Boris originated from a tropical wave that moved of Africa June 8. It passed near the Cape Verde Island with no convection. It crossed Central America on June 23. The wave was very poorly defined on satellite imagery for many days. The first signs of a circulation on satellite imagery appeared on the 26th, centered about 250 miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The system became a tropical depression on the 27th when convective banding increased around the center. 

At its first advisory, it was noted that it get better organized. At that time, tropical storm warnings went up for Mexico. It was also noted the Aviation model forecast Tropical Depression Four-E to make landfall in Mexico as a weak tropical storm in 12 hours. Around that time, the forecast track was issued by the National Hurricane Center late on June 27 stating that it would receive an outflow from close by Hurricane Alma. At the same time the Ukmet model had Tropical Depression Four-E remaining offshore Mexico. The same model also had the depression becoming Tropical Storm Boris. The National Hurricane Center forcasted Tropical Depression Four-E to become Tropical Storm Boris and make landfall in Mexico with winds of . In the same advisory, it was noted that the outer rain bands of brand new Tropical Depression Four-E had moved onshore Mexico. 

The tropical cyclone moved northwestward at 8 to 10 knots for the next two days and strengthened from 25 knots to 80 knots during a 36-hour period, with a ragged eye appearing on satellite imagery just before landfall on the afternoon of June 29 at a peak intensity of , making Boris a moderate Category 1 hurricane. The center crossed the south coast of Mexico midway between Lazaro Cardenas and Acapulco. Boris quickly weakened to a depression and turned southwestward in response to a building ridge to its north. The system was disrupted by the mountainous terrain of Mexico and dissipated on the July 1 after moving back over water just south of Puerta Vallarta.

Hurricane Boris was, in general, a well-forecast storm. Due to the short time when the system was at or above tropical storm intensity, long-range forecasts were not verified. The average errors were at one and a half days in the future. As Hurricane Boris was approaching Mexico, a tropical storm watch was issued for the coast between Manzanillo and Puerto Escondido on June 28. From Manzanillo to Puerto Maldonado, the tropical storm replaced with a hurricane warning the same day.

Boris caused ten deaths. One person was killed in Tecpan. Nearby, three other people drowned and five fishers were missing. In Acapulco, a child was killed when a roof collapsed. Rain was heavy throughout the impacted region, with the highest totals in Guerrero. A total of 12.16 in was recorded in Coyuca de Benítez. The highest total was 14.98 in at Paso de San Antonio, to the east of the point of landfall. Those rains caused a flood on the San Jeronimo River, which left at least 5000 homeless. In Tecpan, a countless number of homes were washed away. The storm flooded lobbies of hotels along the coast. Also, in Acapulco, strong surf pushed fishing boats against a sea wall. Trees were knocked down, and business signs were blown down. Streets were flooded to the level of hubcaps. A total of about 10,000 people were left homeless, and at least 70 people were injured. Approximately 12 boats were sunk offshore. Tecpan bore the brunt of the storm, reporting heavy damage. On July 18 the President and Republic had a meeting for the Victims of Hurricane Boris and Hurricane Cristina later that season in Acapulco, Mexico.

Henryk Szeryng

Henryk Szeryng (pronounce: SHERR-ing), (born Żelazowa Wola, Poland, 22 September 1918; died Kassel, 8 March 1988) was a Polish-born violinist who later became Mexican. He is thought to be one of the greatest violinists of his time.

Szeryng was born in a very small village called Żelazowa Wola in Poland. The famous composer Chopin had also been born in this village. Henryk started to learn the piano from his mother when he was five. When he was seven he changed to the violin. His violin teacher was Maurice Frenkel who had been an assistant to the famous violin teacher Leopold Auer. Four years later he went to Berlin to study with Carl Flesch who was a wonderful teacher for him. Szerynk later said: “Everything I know about the violin I learned from him . After three years he went to Paris to have lessons with Jacques Thibaud at the Paris Conservatory. He got the first prize in 1937. He also studied composition in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, and continued studying with her until 1939.

He gave his first solo performance on 6 January 1933 playing the Brahms Violin Concerto with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra. Szeryng spoke seven languages fluently, so when World War II broke out he became an official interpreter for the Polish government which was based in exile in London. He went with the prime minister to Mexico to find a home for refugees. During the war he gave more than 300 concerts for Allied troops all over the world. During one of these concerts in Mexico City he was given the job of being head of the string department of the university there.

In 1946, he became a naturalized citizen of Mexico.

Szeryng spent several years teaching the violin. Then the pianist Artur Rubinstein told him he ought to perform again, so in 1954 he started to give concerts once more. He spent the rest of his life touring all over the world playing the violin. He made many recordings, and also played many works by Mexican composers, helping them to make their music better known. He became Mexico’s special advisor at UNESCO in Paris. He continued to spend some time teaching, especially in Mexico. He owned several wonderful violins, some of which he gave away.

He died in Kassel. 

Szeryng is remembered for the beautiful tone that he made. He had an amazing technique. He always played very precisely in tune, even “bending” notes slightly to make his intonation very expressive. He could get different qualities of sound by turning the bow slightly or by changing the speed of his vibrato. He was able to play with great emotion in a very individual way.

Elasmotherium (meaning "thin plate beast") was an ancient plant-eating mammal that lived during the Pleistocene epoch. Fossils have been found in Europe and Asia; this giant lived and grazed on the Eurasian (Europe and Asia) steppes (grasslands).

Elasmotherium was a heavily-built quadruped that walked on four short, stocky hoofed legs. It had a huge horn on its forehead; the horn may have been up to 6.5 ft (2 m) long (fossils of the horn have not been found). Elasmotherium was bigger than an elephant; it was 16-26 ft (5-8 m) long and it weighed roughly 3.5 to 4.5 tons (3-4 tonnes). The teeth were tall-crowned and were covered with cement and wrinkled enamel.

Natural sciences

There are some Sciences that are used to study nature. According to these sciences, the things that can be observed in nature follow certain rules. These rules are often unknown, and natural sciences are about finding them. They often use what is called the scientific method to do this.


Some sciences, like Mathematics, can help in all of the above. They make it easier to talk about rules and models.

Other sciences that mainly look at how humans think and behave, and about their society are called social sciences.

The natural sciences are used to make new things (applied science). The natural sciences are guides to test new ideas. They are used to solve engineering problems and technology problems. Math helps the natural sciences to solve problems and make new things. Computers do this too. Computers and math are tools for the natural sciences.

Concentric zone model

The Concentric zone model, or Burgess model is a model to explain how a settlement, such as a city will grow. It was developed by Ernest W. Burgess between 1925 and 1929. Burgess looked at the growth of Chicago in the late 19th and early 20th century. Many people moved to Chicago in that time. 

The model was the first to explain why certain groups of people lived in certain areas of the city. Burgess said that there were circles around the center of the city. The circle a piece of land was in determined how it was used. Burgess saw different zones, starting at the center:

Burgess saw that wealthier people tended to live farther away from the city center. When the city grew, the city center would grow; the rings would also shift outwards.

The model also has some problems, for example:

<doc id="188222" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188222" title="Equilibrium">
Equilibrium

An equilibrium is a state of a system where the system is balanced. A system that is in equilibrium does not change. The word has been used for different concepts from different fields of study. 

Chemical equilibrium is an idea which describes the behavior of chemical reactions over time. In reactions that have finished reacting and have attained equlibrium, the concentrations of the reactant and product chemicals do not change. Instead, the amount of product chemicals to reactant chemicals remains a fixed value; this ratio is called the equilibrium constant (K). For some reactions, the equilibrium constant is very large, in which case nearly all of the reactant chemical is turned into products, such as when paper is burned. For other reactions, it is very small, which results in very little product being formed. If the equilibrium constant is close to 1, a mixture of both products and reactants is expected at equilibrium. When chemists talk about equilibrium constants, they call reactions with large K values favorable and reactions with small K values unfavorable. It is important to note, however, these terms are not judgements about the value or usefulness of a particular chemical reaction. In fact, some very important reactions are actually "unfavorable"; one such example is the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen gas (Haber process), which has a rather small equilibrium constant. 

Understanding the concept of chemical equilibrium in general and finding the equilibrium constant for specific reactions in particular is very important to chemists and other scientists. Discovering the equilibrium constant for a reaction is very helpful for understanding that reaction. Knowing the equilibrium constant of a reaction is important because it allows you to calculate how much product will ultimately be formed during a reaction. Moreover, it also tells you how a particular mixture of chemicals will react. This is because chemical reactions always occur in the direction which will make the ratio of their products to reactants equal to the equilibrium constant. This is known as Le Chattelier's Principal. The exception to this rule is when an outside energy source forces the reaction to occur in the opposite direction, such as when a battery is recharged. Knowing the equilibrium constant of a reaction also helps you to understand the flow of energy that occurs during the reaction (thermodynamics).

<doc id="188224" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188224" title="Packet (computing)">
Packet (computing)

In Information technology, a packet is collection of data that can be used by computers which need to communicate with each other, usually as part of a network. Some computers and networks do not use packets to communicate. But most currently do, including nearly all computers on the Internet. Packets allow many computers on a network to communicate more quickly and easily.

A packet consists of two kinds of data: "control information" and "user data" (or "payload"). If you think of a packet like a letter in the mail, the "control information" is like the outside of the envelope. There's an address that says where to send the letter, and a stamp that says how to send it (fast or slow). Similarly, the computer uses the "control information" in the packet to decide where, and how, to send the data. People aren't usually interested in the control information.

The "user data" is like the inside of the envelope. It is the actual information the computer is trying to send. This might be the contents of a web page, or a user's name and address, for example. It's generally more for people's use, and less for the computer's use.

Different communication protocols put the control information and user information in different places, or make it look different. But they still do the same thing.

Sometimes the computers make mistakes while transmitting data, or have trouble "hearing" each other. So many packets use a checksum or cyclic redundancy check to make sure they got the right information. This is usually one component of the control information. This helps to make sure the packets themselves have the right information. But then computers also need to get the right packets.

Designing computer networks is very hard. Even though today's computers are very fancy, sometimes information doesn't arrive where it's supposed to. Sometimes computers try to fix this and end up sending it twice. And sometimes the information doesn't arrive in the right order. The Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP, was invented to fix these problems. But since it is complex, some computers use the User Datagram Protocol, or UDP, instead.

Errors and residuals in statistics

It is not possible to do an exact measurement, but it is possible to say how accurate a measurement is. This is because one can measure the same thing again and again, and collect all the data together. This allows us to do statistics on the data. Statistics talks about statistical errors and residuals. In both cases what is meant is the difference between the observed or measured value and the real value, which is unknown. 

If there is only one random variable, the difference between statistical errors and residuals is the difference between the mean of the population against the mean of the (observed) sample. In that case the residual is the difference between what the probability distribution says, and what was actually measured.

Suppose there is an experiment to measure the height of 21-year-old men from a certain area. The mean of the distribution is 1.75 m. If one man chosen at random is 1.80 m tall, the "(statistical) error" is 0.05 m (5 cm); if he is 1.70 tall, the error is −5 cm.

A residual (or fitting error), on the other hand, is an observable "estimate" of the unobservable statistical error. The simplest case involves a random sample of "n" men whose heights are measured. The "sample" mean is used as an estimate of the "population" mean. Then we have:


Note that the sum of the residuals within a random sample must be zero. The residuals are therefore "not independent". The sum of the statistical errors within a random sample need not be zero; the statistical errors are independent random variables if the individuals are chosen from the population independently.

In sum:

Bank and Monument stations

Bank and Monument are interlinked stations, officially one station known operationally as the "Bank-Monument complex". However, separate names are used on station entrances, platforms and the tube map. The complex spans the length of King William Street in the City of London. Together they form the eighth busiest station on the network, being served by five London Underground lines and the Docklands Light Railway (DLR). 
The two parts of the combined station take their names from the nearby Bank of England and the Monument to the Great Fire of London. The complex is in Travelcard Zone 1.

London Buses routes 8, 11, 21, 23, 25, 26, 40, 43, 76, 133, 141, 242 and 388 and night bus routes N8, N11, N21, N26, N76, N133, N550 and N551 serve the station.

The Lonely Island

The Lonely Island is an American comedy group made of three people. The people are Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer. They are from Berkeley, California, but are now based in New York City. They work for "Saturday Night Live". They are known for songs such as "I'm On A Boat", "Like a Boss", "Jizz in My Pants", "Dick in a Box", and "Lazy Sunday". They have two albums called "Incredibad" and "Turtleneck and Chain". 

The three members of the Lonely Island (Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone) all grew up in Berkeley, California, and met in junior high school. The three friends moved to Los Angeles and rented an apartment, which they called the Lonely Island.

With increasing recognition, the trio was invited to write parts of the 2005 MTV Movie Awards, which Jimmy Fallon was hosting. Impressed with their material, he brought them to the attention of Lorne Michaels, the producer of "Saturday Night Live", who agreed to see them. Samberg auditioned for the show. He was the only member of TLI who had also been doing stand-up comedy in his free time He was called back for a second audition a few weeks later and was invited to be a cast member; Schaffer and Taccone were invited to join the writing staff based on their work in the trio. Since their arrival on "SNL", the group has written some of the most popular bits in recent "SNL" history, most notably, the "SNL" Digital Shorts. 
The group also made the skit "MacGruber", in which Will Forte plays a MacGyver parody as the main character. In every episode, MacGruber is trapped with his helpers, played by Kristen Wiig (originally Maya Rudolph) and a third person, usually the episode's host and occasionally Richard Dean Anderson as MacGyver, in a room with a bomb that is about to explode. MacGruber starts asking for simple objects to make something to stop the bomb, but he is later distracted by something (usually involving his personal life) that makes him run out of time. Every skit ends with the bomb and place where they are in exploding. All of the skits are directed by Taccone (except for 2 episodes which were directed by writer John Solomon). 

The Lonely Island released their first album, "Incredibad", on February 10, 2009, on Universal Republic Records. Many of the songs on the album debuted on "Saturday Night Live" as SNL Digital Shorts. The album also includes a DVD featuring some of the digital shorts. 

Collaborators on the album include T-Pain, Norah Jones, Jack Black, E-40, Julian Casablancas of The Strokes, Sly & Robbie, DJ Nu-Mark, J-Zone, Natalie Portman, Chris Parnell, and Justin Timberlake.

<doc id="188309" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188309" title="Portal (video game)">
Portal (video game)

Portal is a first-person shooter puzzle video game made by Valve Corporation set inside the "Half-Life" series. It was originally sold in "The Orange Box", a game collection deal which came with the Valve-made games "Portal", "Half-Life 2", and "Team Fortress 2". It is now sold by itself and is available for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Mac and PC.

The player plays as a woman named Chell who has to go though tests while being watched by a computer named GLaDOS, an acronym for Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System. GLaDOS provides all of the game's dialog and is known for being clever, funny, and sarcastic, promising the player character a cake if all of the tests are finished. GLaDOS and the testing rooms were created by a company called Aperture Science, which competes with Black Mesa. The player must use a gun, called the Portal Gun, that makes two linked holes, called portals, to solve puzzles. The two portals, one blue and one orange, are linked together and let the player get from one place to another. When the player enters the blue portal, they will come out of the orange portal.

Portal has many jokes in it that have become popular on the internet, for example, "the cake is a lie". Because the game was very popular, Valve made a sequel in 2011, called "Portal 2".

The game starts with Chell waking up in a small glass room that has only a bed, a toilet, and a radio inside. She is told by GLaDOS that testing will start soon, and an orange portal opens on one of the walls. Once the player goes through, she enters the testing rooms and begins testing. There are 19 testing rooms, called Test Chambers, in all.

The tests start out simple. Chell has to pick up boxes, called Weighted Storage Cubes (Cubes for short), and put them on buttons, which will open the door to the exit of the chamber. At this point, GLaDOS speaks to Chell as a guide, praises her, and promises her cake when the tests are over. Near the beginning of the game, Chell gets the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, also known as the Portal Gun. At first, her Portal Gun only makes blue portals and the orange portals are made by GLaDOS. Later, Chell gets the complete Portal Gun and can make both blue and orange portals.

The tests become more and more dangerous farther into the game. In some rooms, there is deadly acid on the floor. In others, there are balls of electricity called High Energy Pellets which will kill Chell if she touches them. During these tests, GLaDOS becomes more and more sarcastic, giving Chell useless advice, such as "The floor here will kill you. Try to avoid it." At one point, GLaDOS tells Chell a chamber is broken and she must go through a chamber full of sentry guns, called Turrets, instead. If a Turret sees Chell, it will shoot at her until she dies. In this chamber is a hidden room. In the hidden room are drawings and writing on the walls left by an unknown person. The writing says things like "the cake is a lie" and "she's always watching" with a picture of a camera. There are more rooms like this in later chambers.

In another chamber, Chell has to use the Weighted Companion Cube, which looks like a Weighted Storage Cube with hearts on it, to solve the test. During the test, GLaDOS tells Chell several times that the Companion Cube is not alive, but at the end of the test, she tells Chell she has to "kill" the Companion Cube to get to the next test. 

During the last test, Chell has to stand on a moving platform. At the end of the platform's track, it will carry her into a fire pit. GLaDOS thanks Chell for doing the tests. At the last minute, Chell uses her Portal Gun to escape the trap. While trying to escape the building, Chell is led into a room where she finds GLaDOS. Chell breaks a white ball that fell out of GLaDOS. GLaDOS tells her she was stupid to break it because they did not know what it was, but GLaDOS quickly figures out it was her morality core. She tells Chell the people who worked for Aperture Science installed it to make her stop killing them with "Deadly Neuro-Toxin". Because Chell broke it, GLaDOS can use the Neuro-Toxin again. Chell has a time limit of 6 minutes to kill GLaDOS before the Neuro-Toxin kills Chell. After breaking pieces off of her and burning them, GLaDOS is destroyed and Chell escapes the building. 

After Chell escapes, she faints, and a robot drags her back into the building. During the credits, GLaDOS sings a song called "Still Alive" written by Jonathan Coulton, that says even though Chell killed her, she is still alive.

"Portal" is a first-person shooter game, which means that it is played from the view of the player character, Chell. When players get the fully-powered portal gun, they can make two portals that are linked together on some white surfaces. Chell starts out with nothing, only able to do what GLaDOS lets her, such as entering portals created by GLaDOS and using cubes that GLaDOS gives her. Once Chell gets a half-powered portal gun, she can fire a blue portal that connects to orange portals that GLaDOS puts in the rooms. When Chell gets the fully-powered portal gun, she can put both portals anywhere. 

The portals are linked, making a tunnel that Chell can walk through. The tunnel works in both directions, so if Chell enters a blue portal, she will exit from an orange portal, and if she enters an orange portal, she will exit from a blue portal. The purpose of the portals is to make shortcuts to different areas, for example, if the player needs to get to a high ledge but is unable to jump to it, they can put a blue portal at their level and fire an orange portal above the ledge. Going through those portals will get the player onto the ledge.

The portals can be used in different ways, notably as a way to catapult Chell. If the player cannot put a portal on a high ledge but can put one on a wall across from the ledge and one on the floor below, these portals can be used to propel Chell forward far enough to reach the ledge. This is because portals do not affect forward momentum. When Chell enters the portal in the floor and exits the portal in the wall, she will fall, gaining speed. If she goes through the portal on the floor again while falling, she will be going fast enough that when she exits the wall portal again, she will be able to land on the ledge.

The different ways the portals work together mean there are multiple ways to solve the puzzles in the Test Chambers.

Balochistan or Baluchistan is an arid region on the Iranian Plateau. The plateau is in Southwest Asia and South Asia, between Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. The area is named after the numerous Baloch tribes. The Baloch are an Iranian people who moved into the area from the west around A.D. 1000. All natives are considered Balochi even if they do not speak the Balochi language; Pashto, Persian, Hazaragi, and Brahui languages are also spoken in the region. The southern part of Balochistan is known as Makran. Now it is recognised by UNPO as an Unrepresented Nation.

Balochistan's landscape is made of barren, rugged mountains and fertile land. During the summer, some regions of Balochistan are the hottest. Most of the land is barren, particularly the Iranian and Afghan side of the region. Relatively few people live there. In the south (Makran) is the desert through which Alexander the Great passed with great difficulty.

<doc id="188342" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188342" title="Naked Mole Rat">
Naked Mole Rat

The naked mole rat ("Heterocephalus glaber"), also known as the sand puppy, or desert mole rat is a burrowing rodent. The species is native to parts of East Africa. It is only species currently classified in genus Heterocephalus. It is one of only two known eusocial mammals (the other is the Damaraland mole rat). 

The animal has an unusual set of traits, which allow for a life in a harsh, underground environment. 
The animals are unable to feel pain in their skin. They also have a very low metabolism.

Typically, the animals are between eight and ten centimetres long, and weigh about 30 grams. Queens are larger and may weigh well over 50 g, the largest reaching 80 g. They are well-adapted to their underground existence. Their eyes are quite small, and they do not see very well. Their legs are thin and short. Nevertheless, they are very good at moving underground and can move backward as fast as they can move forward. They have large, protruding teeth, which they use to dig. Their lips are sealed just behind the teeth to prevent soil from filling their mouths while digging. They have little hair (which is the reason for their common name) and wrinkled pink or yellowish skin.

The naked mole rat is well adapted for the limited availability of oxygen within the tunnels that are its habitat: its lungs are very small and its blood has a very strong affinity for oxygen, increasing the efficiency of oxygen uptake. It has a very low respiration and metabolic rate for an animal of its size, about two thirds that of a mouse of the same size. It only uses very little oxygen. In long periods of hunger, such as a drought, its metabolic rate can reduce by up to twenty-five percent.

The naked mole rat can only regulate its body temperature in the typical mammalian fashion over a relatively narrow range of temperatures. Outside this range, it overheats or cools. It can overcome this via behavioral means to keep a constant temperature. When cold, naked mole rats will huddle together or bask in the shallow parts of their burrow systems. When they get too hot, they retreat to the deeper, cooler parts of their tunnel system.

The skin of naked mole rats lacks a key neurotransmitter called substance P. This neurotransmitter is responsible in mammals for sending pain signals to the central nervous system. When naked mole rats are exposed to acid or capsaicin, they feel no pain. When injected with Substance P, however, the pain signaling works as it does in other mammals, but only with capsaicin and not with the acids. This probably is an adaptation to the animal living in high levels of carbon dioxide due to poorly ventilated living spaces, which would cause acid to build up in their body tissues.

The naked mole rat is native to the drier parts of the tropical grasslands of East Africa, mainly South Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia.

colonies averaging 75-80 individuals live together in complex systems of burrows in arid African deserts. The tunnel systems built by naked mole rats can stretch up to two or three miles in cumulative length.

The naked mole rat is one of the two species of mammals that exhibit eusociality. They have a complex social structure in which only one female (the queen) and one to three males reproduce, while the rest of the members of the colony function as workers. As in certain bee species, the workers are divided along a continuum of different worker-caste behaviors instead of discrete groups. Some function primarily as tunnellers, expanding the large network of tunnels within the burrow system, and some primarily as soldiers, protecting the group from outside predators.

This eusocial organisation social structure, similar to that found in ants, termites, and some bees and wasps, is very rare among mammals. The Damaraland Mole Rat ("Cryptomys damarensis") is the only other eusocial mammal currently known.

The relationships between the queen and the breeding males may last for many years. A behaviour called reproductive suppression is believed to be the reason why the other females do not reproduce, meaning that the infertility in the working females is only temporary, and not genetic. Queens live from 13 to 18 years, and are extremely hostile to other females behaving like queens, or producing hormones for becoming queens. When the queen dies, another female takes her place, sometimes after a violent struggle with her competitors.

Males and females are able to breed at one year of age. Gestation is about 70 days. A litter typically ranges from three to twelve pups, but may be as large as 28. The average litter size is 11. In the wild, naked mole-rats usually breed once a year, if the litter survives. In captivity, they breed all year long and can produce a litter every 80 days. The young are born blind and weigh about 2 g. The queen nurses them for the first month; after which the other members of the colony feed them feces until they are old enough to eat solid food.

Naked mole rats feed primarily on very large tubers (weighing as much as 1000 times the body weight of a typical mole rat) that they find deep underground through their mining operations, but also eat their own feces (coprophagia). A single tuber can provide a colony with a long-term source of food—lasting for months, or even years, as they eat the inside but leave the outside, allowing the tuber to regenerate. Symbiotic bacteria in their intestines help them digest the fibres. 

The naked mole rat is also of interest because it is extraordinarily long-lived for a rodent of its size (up to 28 years) and holds the record for the longest living rodent. The secret of their longevity is debated, but is thought to be related to the fact that they can shut down their metabolism during hard times, and so prevent oxidative damage. This has been summed up as "They're living their life in pulses."

Due to their extraordinary longevity for such a small rodent, an international effort was put into place to sequence the genome of the naked mole rat.

Naked mole rats are not threatened. Despite their tough living conditions, naked mole rats are quite widespread and numerous in the drier regions of East Africa.
Though seen living up to 20 years, their lifestyles in those situations consist of mostly sleep.

Capsaicin

Capsaicin is a chemical substance. It is responsible for the sense of "hotness" found in chile peppers. In mammals, it causes a sensation of "burning" of the tissues it comes in contact with. Capsicain, and other similar substances called capsaicinoids are produced by chile peppers and other plants, probably as a protection against being eaten. Pure capsaicin is a hydrophobic, colorless, odorless, crystalline to waxy compound.

capsaicinoids are added to food to make it have a "hot" taste, but it can also be used as an analgesic, a painkiller. Such painkillers are often directly used on the skin. The "burning" of the capsaicin will mask the real pain. Capsicaicin is also the main agent in pepper spray. 

Capsicain is not soluble in water; it binds to oil and fat. Soap can be used to wash it off. If something too hot has been eaten, milk or yoghurt can be used.

Gravitational potential energy

Gravitational potential energy is energy associated with gravity or gravitational force.

An object gets gravitational potential energy when it moves uphill. The energy used up when moving up the hill is changed into gravitational potential energy. When the object comes back down again, the gravitational potential energy is turned back into kinetic energy (movement). That's why riding a bike up a steep hill is very hard, but when you are coming back down, you will not need to pedal at all - you are being powered by the gravitational potential energy that you stored when you rode up the hill. Another way gravitational potential energy helps us is by keeping earth and the other planets in orbit in our solar system around the sun.

London Underground 1967 Stock

The 1967 Stock was a deep-level tube stock that ran on the Victoria line from 1968 to 2011. These trains do not run on the London Underground. anymore as they were replaced by the London Underground 2009 Stock between 2010 and 2011. The stock was built by Metro-Cammell. The trains have also ran on the Woodford–Hainault section of the Central Line in the past.

An order to buy 30½ 8-car trains of 1967 Stock was made in March 1964. They were built by Metro-Cammell. Each train is made up of two 4-car units that are joined together. The trains cost £2.25 million to build. Today this would buy just three trains. The first unit was delivered to West Ruislip depot on 27 September 1967, and the fleet was bought to run the Victoria Line. The units were then tested at the depot, before they were moved to Hainault depot and being tried out in passenger service on the Woodford-Hainault on the Central line. Once the tests were finished, the trains were moved from Hainault to Northumberland Park Depot using a battery locomotive. The trains are were looked after at this depot until they were scrapped. It is the only part of the Victoria line that is not Underground, and it is unusual because, unlike the rest of the London Undergound network, there is a staff rail link from Seven Sisters station.

The trains had Automatic Train Operation (ATO). The train operator controls when the doors open and close and also starts the train by pressing two buttons at the same time. These buttons start the automatic process of driving the train. The trains were built with wrap-around windows in the driving cabs and were the first London Underground trains to have windows like this. The trains were delivered with a shiny grey coat, but this soon faded to a dull grey.

When the extension Victoria line to Brixton opened in July 1971, a further 72 cars of 1967 Stock were ordered, which made up 9 trains. This brought the total number of 1967 Stock trains to 39½.

In 1989, a refurbishment programme was started across the whole fleet of London Underground rolling stock, following the King's Cross fire in 1987. The Victoria line stock was chosen to be the first to be refurbished (repaired, changed and made to look newer). The refurbishment was carried out by Tickford Rail at Rosyth Dockyard. The refurbishment was due to take 5 years to complete, but the last train did not leave the works until 1997, because each train was slightly different to the next train. When the trains had completed the refurbishment the outside was painted in a white, blue and red colour scheme. The insides of the trains have fire-resistant materials and are finished in the Victoria line blue colours, though some have the Bakerloo line brown as they run on that line too.

The last 1967 stock in passenger service ran on 30th June 2011. It has been replaced by 2009 Stock.

London Underground 2009 Stock

The 2009 stock is a type of London Underground train. It is built by Bombardier Transportation at their Litchurch Lane Works in Derby, England. The Stock belongs to Bombardier's "Movia" type of train. Bombardier Transportation UK used to be known as ADtranz, and before that ABB Asea Brown Boveri. ABB Asea Brown Boveri built the 1992 Stock which is currently used on the Central and Waterloo & City lines. 

Forty-seven 8-car units will be built for use on the Victoria line. These will replace the line's original 1967 Tube Stock. The trains are still being built. They will be introduced by 2012, when all of the 1967 Stock trains will be completely replaced. The first 2009 Stock train started running on the line with passengers on board on 21 July 2009. One new train will enter service every two weeks from early 2010.

The trains are part of a 3.4 billion pound contract that was awarded to Bombardier by Metronet. The contract was to supply new trains featuring Automatic Train Operation and signalling for the Victoria and sub-surface lines. When it is finished this upgrade should make the lines and trains more reliable. There should also be an 8% decrease in journey times between stations, and a 16% overall decrease in journey times. This decrease is partly because the new trains have better performance that the 1967 Tube Stock that they are replacing. The new trains have a higher top speed of , a faster maximum acceleration of 1.3 m/s, a normal service deceleration of 1.14 m/s, and an emergency brake deceleration of 1.4m/s. This is the same as the 1992 Tube Stock.

During the busiest times of the day, or the "peaks", 43 trains should be available in service. This will be an increase of 6 trains over the 37 units of 1967 Tube Stock. The trains have seats for 252 people and standing space for an estimated 1196 passengers. This gives a 19% increase in capacity. The new trains also have wider doors for easier boarding and alighting (to descend or step down) of passengers to decrease the times that the trains have to wait at stations.

The new trains are being built wider than the current 1967 Tube Stock. This is because the Victoria line has a larger than normal loading gauge compared to the other deep level tube lines.. The larger size means that the new trains cannot leave the Victoria line except by road as they are too wide to travel on the other London Underground deep level tube lines. This means that to move the units, each car has to be , loaded onto a lorry, and then re-coupled when they are delivered. The trains have been built using Bombardier's technology called FICAS, which gives them a thinner bodyshell. Along with the larger size this gives more space for passengers.

The stock is the first to be designed since the Rail Vehicle Accessibilty Regulations came into force. Because of this they will have more facilities for people with impaired mobility, including multi-purpose areas with tip-up seats and space for wheelchairs and pushchairs and offset centre door poles for wheelchair access.

The design of the trains was finalised in September 2004, and manufacture of two pre-production trains began in January 2005. The first train was scheduled to be completed by mid-2006. Metronet announced on 3 February 2006 that the first of the pre-production cars had been completed to allow it to be tested without being moved. From 21 July until 4 August 2006, a example of the train was on show at Euston Square Gardens, near Euston Square tube station, for a Customer Acceptance Test followed by public display. From September 2006, the first of the two trains underwent testing at Bombardier's manufacturing and test site at their Litchurch Lane Works in Derby. It was due to be delivered to London Underground by the end of 2006 for testing on the Victoria line during engineering hours (times after the line stops carrying passengers and repair and testing work is carried out), but this did not occur until May 2007. It will also be used for driver and maintenance training and familiarisation. The first of the trains was expected to begin passenger service for the Victoria line for evaluation purposes in July 2008, with the remainder of the fleet being delivered and entering passenger service in 2009. However, by October 2007 the date for the first train entering service had been moved to January 2009. The first train entered service on 21 July 2009, leaving Northumberland Park depot at 23:00 and forming train 277 leaving Seven Sisters at 23:55 to Brixton.

Mousavi is currently the president of the Iranian Academy of Arts. He also was a candidate for the 2009 presidential election.

Before his post as prime minister, he was the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He is also a member of the Expediency Discernment Council and the High Council of Cultural Revolution. He has not attended their meetings for years. Political analysts think that he does not like these councils. In the early years of the revolution, Mousavi was the editor-in-chief of the official newspaper of the Islamic Republican Party, the "Jomhouri-e Eslami" (Islamic Republic) newspaper. In 2009 presidential election, Mousavi chose green as his campaign color, a color which has since become common in Iran.

Lévesque was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada from 1960 until he left in 1967. He had the position of Minister of Natural Resources.

The goal of the Parti was to give Quebec its own Sovereignty, or to make it its own country outside of Canada. The Parti Québécois won the 1976 Quebec provincial election putting them in power. Soon after coming to power, Bill 101 is released. This is a Law that says that French is the only official language of Quebec. At this time, Canada had two official languages; English and French. In 1980 a vote is held. This vote is called a Referendum. Citizens of Quebec are asked if they wish to leave Canada and become a new country. This vote ends with 60% of the voters wanting to stay in Canada.

For most of his life, René smoked cigarettes. On November 1, 1987 he started having Chest Pains. He died of a Heart attack later that day while in the Hospital.

Weak interaction

Weak interaction, also called the weak force or weak nuclear force, is one of the four fundamental forces in the universe. It is carried by a particle known as a gauge boson. The weak force causes beta decay, a form of radioactivity. At extremely high energy levels, the force of weak interaction and electromagnetism begin to act the same, and this is called electroweak interaction.

Beta Decay is what scientists call an atom breaking down. The different types of breaking down are called radioactivity. Beta Decay can be simply explained as breaking down a neutron into a proton and an electron. However, this is not completely true.

Beta Decay begins with a neutron, which is made of one up quark and two down quarks. Since up quarks have a charge of +2/3, and each down quark has a charge of -1/3, 2/3 -1/3 -1/3 = 0 charge. Due to weak force, if there are too many neutrons in an atom nucleus, one of the down quarks in one of the neutrons turns into an up quark. This would change the charge of the neutron from 0 to (2/3 +2/3 -1/3) +1. From this, the neutron is no longer a neutron, but actually a proton (particle with a charge of +1). 

In a strange quantum effect, this transformation releases a particle called a W boson. This is the gauge boson (force-carrying particle) of weak force. Oddly, the W boson weighs about 80 times as much as a neutron. This sort of thing actually happens very often in quantum mechanics, but it follows the conservation of energy because it happens so quickly. After 3x10 seconds, the W boson breaks into an electron and an electron antineutrino. (The electron antineutrino doesn't really do much). This releases the electron, and basically creates a proton from a neutron.

Wood Street railway station is in Walthamstow. It is a part of the London Borough of Waltham Forest in north east London. It is in Travelcard Zone 4. It was opened in 1873.

When the Victoria line was being planned, this station was going to be the end of the line instead of Walthamstow Central station. A decision was made in 1961 though which meant that this did not happen. If this station had become the end of the Victoria line the building would have been on the surface next to the British Railways station.

Deep-level tube lines

Deep-level tube lines were built by tunnelling shields and are tunnels that are deep underground that allow trains to run through them. They are commonly found on the London Underground. An example is the Victoria line. The Victoria line, the circle, jubilee are all deep level lines. They are very hard to find air ventilation as they are the deepest. But the very deepest line is the northern line. On the northern line it is absolutely difficult to replace the train as it is ultimately the deepest line in the entire network. Subject to that, the ventilation is very difficult and there is not a lot of fans that are there to cool the trains down. Even in the event of a emergency the people trapped on-board cannot get off due to the insufficient space inside the tunnel compared to the subsurface line.

Sympathetic nervous system

The Sympathetic nervous system is part of the autonomic nervous system. It becomes more active when you are stressed. It is a part of the "fight or flight" response. The sympathetic nervous system can increase heart rate; make bronchial passages wider; decrease motility (movement) of the large intestine; make blood vessels narrower; increase peristalsis in the esophagus; cause pupil dilation, piloerection (goose bumps) and perspiration (sweating); and raise blood pressure.

Pierre Monteux

Pierre Monteux (born Paris, 4 April 1875; died Hancock, Maine, 14 July 1964) was an French-born conductor who later became an American citizen. He was one of the great conductors of his time.

Monteux was born in Paris and started to learn the violin when he was six. When he was nine he learned at the Paris Conservatoire. When he was twelve he conducted an orchestra in Paris with the pianist Alfred Cortot as soloist. He played in orchestras, and was the principal of the viola section in the first performance of Debussy’s opera "Pelléas et Mélisande". He started to conduct some of the concerts in the series Concerts Colonne.

Monteux also played his viola in chamber music. He played a string quartet by Brahms with the composer in the audience.

Monteux soon became famous as a conductor. He conducted the orchestra for Diaghilev’s Ballet Russes, conducting the first performances of Stravinskys "'Petrouchka", "Rite of Spring" as well as Ravel’s "Daphnis et Chloé" and Debussy’s "Jeux". These were some of the greatest ballets of the 20th century.

In 1916 Monteux went to the USA and conducted the French operas at the Metropolitan Opera. In 1920 he moved to Boston, conducting many new works by Debussy, Chausson, Darius Milhaud and others. In 1924 he became assistant conductor at the Concertgebouw Orchestra, Amsterdam. He started the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris in 1929, and also a school for conducting, the Ecole Monteux, in Paris. Later he continued this teaching in his American home in Maine. Neville Marriner and André Previn were two of his pupils.

In 1936 he became conductor of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. He stayed with this orchestra until 1952. He made this orchestra internationally famous. In 1942 he became an American citizen. In the 1950s he often conducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

Monteux continued to conduct until shortly before his death at the age of 89. In 1961 he was appointed chief conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra for 25 years, although he did not live long enough to fulfil this. He conducted this orchestra in 1963 in a performance of the "Rite of Spring", fifty years after he had conducted the first performance.

Monteux always prepared his work very carefully. He was not a conductor who liked to show off. He rehearsed his orchestras thoroughly, and conducted with small gestures. Although he made gramophone recordings, he did not like recordings. He preferred concerts with a live audience. He received many honours, including the Légion d’honneur and the Knight of the Order of Oranje Nassau.

Willem Mengelberg

Willem Mengelberg (born Utrecht, 28 March 1871; died Zuort, Switzerland, 22 March 1951) was a Dutch conductor. He is famous for conducting the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam for fifty years, making them one of the world’s finest orchestras.

Willem Mengelberg studied music in Utrecht, Netherlands and at Cologne Conservatory. He had four years of experience conducting an orchestra in Lucerne. Then, in 1895, he was given the job which was to last him the rest of his working life: conductor of the Concertgebouw Orchestra. He took over this job from Willem Kes who had started the orchestra five years earlier. At Kes’s farewell concert on 25 October 1895 Mengelberg performed as solo pianist. 

Mengelberg soon made it into a great orchestra. He was particularly good at conducting the music of Richard Strauss and Mahler. He took the orchestra on tours to many countries, including Norway, Belgium, France, Germany, England and Switzerland. He celebrated his 25th year of conductor of the orchestra by performing all the orchestral works of Mahler. 

He also conducted other orchestras abroad, including the Royal Philharmonic Society in London and, in the 1920s, the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.

Mengelberg also conducted other groups in the Netherlands, including Maatschappij Caecilia and the Amsterdam Toonkunst Choir. 

Mengelberg worked hard to get good discipline in his orchestra. He worked to introduce his audiences to good music and to make them listen quietly to the music. He did a lot to help the musicians get better working conditions and he conducted a lot of music by Dutch composers, helping them to become better known.

During World War II he accepted invitations by the Nazis to conduct in Germany. After the war people in Holland were very cross that he had done this, and he was forbidden to conduct in Holland for six years. He said that he had only conducted in Germany for the sake of the musicians.

Mengelberg was very sad and went to live in Switzerland. He died just before his six year ban would have come to an end.

National Health Service

The National Health Service is a government run health care organization that provides health and medical services to citizens and residents of the United Kingdom. It was started in 1948 and intended by its creators to be "free at the point of service". This meant that people who use the NHS would not be required to pay for services each time they used them.

The NHS is paid for out of employee contributions from their wages and also from general government money raised in the form of taxes. The promise of a health service that would be free at the point of service was broken almost right away with the start of prescription charges. Prescription charges are a set price that people within England must pay for each item on a prescription form. This charge is currently £7.10 for each item and is raised each year.

The health service is run in different ways depending on which country within the United Kingdom a person lives in. For instance, there are no charges for prescriptions in Scotland or Wales, but there are in England. 

The service also provides basic dental services and prescription eyeglasses, hearing aids, prosthetic limbs and other services. There are normally charges at the point of service for these services unless one lives in a no-charge country or is considered a special needs case; such as children (aged up to 18, or up to 21 if you are a student), pregnant women, or the elderly.

Acid throwing

Acid throwing or vitriolage is a form of violent assault. The attackers throw acid at their victims. Usually they throw it at their faces. They want to damage skin tissue, even to expose and to dissolve the bones. The consequences of these attacks include blindness and permanent scars of the face and body. 

In India, the number of acid attacks have been rising. There had been 68 acid attacks in Karnataka alone (of which Bangalore is the capital) since 1999. These are only the cases that have been reported. Unlike India, Bangladesh has introduced the death penalty for throwing acid and laws strictly controlling the sales of acids since 2002. 
An important role for the introduction of that legislation had the Acid Survivors Foundation.

A wheel war is a fight between two or more in which they undo one another's administrative actions — for example, and reblocking a user; undeleting and redeleting; or unprotecting and reprotecting a page. Do not undo another administrator's action when that administrator opposes it. Do not continue a chain of administrative reversals without discussion.


If you feel the "urge" to wheel war, try these alternatives: 

Wikipedia works on the spirit of . Disputes should be settled through civil discussion rather than power wrestling. It is not fair to the community.

A wheel war can result in an emergency desysop by a for a period, until the community can decide if a should happen.

I can't see their being to much legal strain as most other Wikipedias do allow Non-Free logos ect. without to much trouble. Thanks for your help!-- () 12:51, 22 June 2009 (UTC)
Djsasso: You can upload ogg files locally, so there is a point to have local upload. 16:26, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

Fair use images may allow better illustration of certain subjects. Is there any reason we should not allow it, other than above? And are we willing to craft a short policy in image use? There is nothing forbidding it as a foundation issue. () 16:32, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

We do not need "fair use" images. This is a free encyclopedia, not a "mostly free with some copyrighted bits in it" encyclopedia. 18:42, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

Why do people keep bringing this up? Because they need to use Fair use images! If this wasn't something that editors needed then editors would not keep fighting for it. As admins you are all being selfish. The encyclopedia is suffering because you don't want extra work. That is kind of sad as most editors are admins, and we only get around 150 edits an hour.-- () 19:32, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

Uh... no one "needs" to use a copyrighted image. This is supposed to be a "free" encyclopedia - how can it possibly be free if we allow a copyrighted image to be uploaded. The two ideas simply don't work together. Either we are free or not. 20:05, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

If we can upload these images it will make the encyclopedia articles better. I find it sad that we are not making Wikipedia better just because we don't want to do more work, or that we are affraid to be simmilar to EN.

Sometimes I read scientific articles on the Simple Wikipedia, and i am shocked at the use of language. They contain sentences like 
"An atom is about 1×10 m or 1 / 1,000,000,000,000 meters. So they are very very small." and "Very tiny black holes would die and turn into energy before they could hurt people."
Many scientific articles are like that. Is it just me, or do some authors not see the difference between simple language and simple explanations. Apparently, they are aiming for really retarded people (and children under 10 years of age), rather than at a general Wikipedia audience (including interested laymen, students and even specialists) who simply have problems reading the English Wikipedia article, not because of their mental state but because of their knowledge of the English language. -- () 09:59, 23 June 2009 (UTC)

Anywho, in regards to the problem, and try to help fix it.-- () 16:29, 23 June 2009 (UTC)

The readers and editors are not stupid, they're simply using small, basic words aimed to help people who DON'T speak English as their first language, or are learning. It might be too "simple and stupid" for you but it's understandable for people who aren't native English speakers. I know sometimes it can get too unencyclopedic like using "really really really small" (and statements like these you can change yourself) but nope, I don't think the readers are "stupid." If you'd like a more complex explanation you can go to En. :) -- () 02:05, 25 June 2009 (UTC)

All the greatest things are simple. Long demagogy/articles are not native to our differential thinking patterns, but its very fun way of wasting time for people, which want to show how advanced they are at some of themes/questions :) 
That’s why I prefer to read OLD "inaccurate" revisions of some articles - they are really more useful. () 11:23, 26 June 2009 (UTC)

I think that Simple English is great idea. This is because it allows younger people to visit wikipedia and understand the information they are looking for. Also, if you don't understand something on English wikipedia, then you can look on simple english for a clearer meaning. If you are shocked by the language, why don't you use English Wikipedia? Or why don't you edit the page to put in better language? () 13:50, 27 June 2009 (UTC)

Hello all,

we will soon reach 60.000 articles, and I could imagine that we provide some of this wikipedia content offline (read: on a CD or DVD image), possibly using OpenZIM. I know that most of our articles here are probably not good enough to showcase, so if we do this, I would suggest selecting between 5.000 and 10.000 articles to put on the CD or DVD (depending on how big the image/dump will be). A dump/image of German Wikipedia is currently available at Linuxtag 2009.

Most of these process are, unfortunately, getting to the activity levels that they had near the start of the year, with little or no input from people who aren't nominators. If I could just ask everyone to nominate or review a DYK hook or review an article at the rest of the processes it would be very much appreciated. Remember, if we can increase the amount of quality content on our wiki, then we will (hopefully) be able to lose the title of being a "useless" wiki, and we can try and attract editors more from other wikis, such as EN.

As much as I hate to bring IRC/Off wiki matters on wiki, it needs to be done as otherwise we don't seem to make any progress whatsoever.

We need more chanops in #wikipedia-simple who aren't Majorly/PeterSymonds/Werdan7. There have been multiple instances of channel trolling and abuse recently and there have been no ops around to sort things out. Despite words on IRC by multiple users there has been no change, so I am bringing it here to make it more known and perhaps apply a little peer pressure.

Thoughts?


No one has mentioned this to me, as far as I can recall, and I am one of the people who can make new ops. I'm happy to make new ops as we need them, certainly. I don't have a problem with this being discussed on the wiki, but I disagree that every admin should be one. Some admins barely use IRC as it is, or aren't familiar enough with how it works. 15:27, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

I have been in a dialogue via e-mail with a user banned here and cross-wiki, and he is genuinely remorseful for his actions. Apparently he does want a second chance, and he's told me which accounts were his, and which weren't - he's also admitted to meatpuppetry too (like some certain en.wiki users). I think you probably know who I'm referring to, and although some of you may not like him, he "has" made some good contributions on en.wiki. However, since an admin on a non-WMF wiki has given him his own personal sandbox wiki, he has promised to do any vandalism/nonsense there and behave on WMF. This banned user does have mental health issues though, from what he's told me. Anyway, I'll leave it to you to discuss. -- () 22:06, 20 July 2009 (UTC)


Frankly, this banned user can ask for themselves to be unbanned here. You are an unknown user account here who has very little edits and admits on your userpage that you are a single purpose account. Whomever this "other" user is, I'm sure they have at least one account that has either talkpage or email access so they can ask themselves! This "dialogue" only raises my RADAR frankly. 00:30, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

How is not implying ownership? Instead, we should encourage the students to create the article in their user space and we can offer suggestions on it and when the project is over (or they have finished editing) they can create the article. () 02:18, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

Hello all!

Recently quite a few requests have been made and they were carried out by to remove edits made by vandals and bad editors who added information of a personally identifiable nature or of a libelous nature to our project. The amount of oversight actions increased recently not due to the number of such edits occurring, but because some admins (myself included) have decided to actually have such edits removed from anyone's view. Considering that attack pages against identifiable people, and libelous information gets regullarly added to our project, I think we should reconsider electing two or more local oversighters. Indeed on IRC (which is the official way of requesting oversight per WMF) the stewards themselves have indicated that we may be better served by electing local oversighters. Up till now, admins have simply deleted such edits, but that is not the proper way of dealing with them. We are supposed to fully remove them from being able to be accessed by anyone, including admins. As such, I'd like to propose (as one of the people who opposed last time) that we reconsider the election of local oversighters. These admins should be very well trusted and respected people and they must be people who are able and willing to identify themselves to WMF. Recently at least a dozen such actions have been taken, and many more could be taken based on a review of the deletion logs. Discussion has been held recently on and there seems to be support there for such an election. As such, kindly read and decide whether or not you think we need to have our own oversighters locally. 

Thank you very much 06:05, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

"NB: Let's not discuss who should be elected at this point, but merely whether we think we should persue the idea. Elections can come later on in the process if we find we want to go forwards."

As I noted elsewhere, I have been persuaded. 12:06, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

Binary Arithmetic

Binary Arithmetic is a way of adding together two or more binary numbers.

There are four rules in binary arithmetic. They are:

"0" + "0" = "0"
<br>"1" + "0" = "1"
<br>"1" + "1" = "10" (2)
<br>"1" + "1" + "1" = "11" (3)

This is because in binary there are only two digit; 0 and 1. Because of this, the number two and three have to be represented in some other way. This is how the binary value for three is calculated:
This shows that the binary value would be "11".

Differentiation

Differentiation is a technique used to find the gradient, or slope, of a line on a graph. It is the opposite of integration. Differentiating a function gives a derivative. This derivative is an equation which will give the gradient of a graph when numbers are put in. A derivative is a rate of change; how one variable or thing changes when another changes.

When differentiating, there are many ways to write it out. The most common way is formula_1. This means differentiate y with respect to x. The function y must be defined by values of x. Another way is formula_2. This is used when you do not want to define y, and is often used for examples and identities, such as below.
You can also use the function notation. The first derivative of a function formula_3 is, in this notation, formula_4, where the f is followed by a small vertical dash ', like an apostrophe.
Another notation is to use dots on top of the variable to differentiate. This can only be used if it is very obvious what you are differentiating with respect to. In the example below, it is obvious that we are differentiating with respect to x so the dot notation can be used. 
formula_5
formula_6

The method for a normal equation is: take the power x is raised to, multiply x by this number, and then subtract 1 from the power. In a formula, this is:
formula_7

For example: formula_8

Equations with many terms are differentiated by differentiating each term by itself:
formula_9

The differentials of e are fairly simple, because formula_10 is the derivative of itself:
formula_11
In a more general form, where e is raised to a function of x, formula_3:
formula_13
This is a simple example of the chain rule. (see below)

The differential of formula_14 is formula_15, and in a general form:
formula_16

The methods shown above for differentiation do not work when you have a function of a function or a function divided or multiplied by another. Three rules show what happens in these cases, and are called the chain rule, quotient rule and product rule respectively.

The chain rule is used where a function of x is put into another function, for example formula_17. The method is to differentiate the "outside" function with respect to the inside function, and then the inside function with respect to x. This formula can then be applied, where u is the "inside" function:
formula_18

Let formula_19. Make formula_20 so that u = formula_21.
formula_22
formula_23
formula_24

The product rule states that the differential of formula_25 (where u and v are functions of x) with respect to x is the sum of one differentiated multiplied by the other (which is not differentiated). This, as a formula, is:
formula_26

formula_27
formula_28
formula_29
formula_30

Differentiation is used in many different aspects of science and maths. For example, chemical reaction rates are modeled by differential equations. Probably the most important and easy to understand use of differentiation is with displacement, velocity and acceleration.<br>

Velocity is defined as the rate of change of displacement with time. Displacement is essentially distance from a point, and velocity is essentially speed, although there are some differences. Taking displacement to be x and time to be t, velocity v is:
formula_31<br>
Say a particle starts 5m from point P. In ten seconds, it moved to 30m from P, with a steady velocity and no acceleration, and no forces acting on it. The velocity of the particle in this time is: <br>
formula_32

Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity, with respect to time:
formula_33
Now the particle, 30m from P, has accelerated from 2.5m s (v) with an acceleration of 3m s for 5 seconds. We would like to know the new velocity (v):
formula_34

Road number

A road number is usually given to a portion of public roadway. The chosen number often depends on the type of road. The numbers will be different if the road is an interstate, a motorway, an arterial thoroughfare, a two-lane road, and so forth.

In the United Kingdom, the road number has a letter and a number. It is between 1 and 4 digits long. For instance, the main road from London to Edinburgh is called the A1. The "A" means it is a first class route. This also means it is more important than "B" roads. The A2, A3, A4, A5, A6 begin in London and go towards various towns around the coast. Roads which start in the area between the A1 and the A2 must start with the number 1 (A137, B1412), etc. Scotland is also divided into zones by the A7, A8 and A9 leave from Edinburgh. Motorways have the letter "M", for example the M25. Motorways have a different numbering system from "A" and "B" roads. 

This system is used in other European countries (for example, Spain and France).

Russian Social Democratic Labour Party

Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) was a Russian political party. 

It was founded in 1898. The RSDLP program was based on Marxism and socialism. The party wanted to head the workers of Russia and to throw down the Tsar. Some members of the party wanted the democracy. They were called "Mensheviks". Other members of the party spoke for the dictatorship of the working class. They were called "Bolsheviks". The leaders of the Menshevik group were Martov and Potresov. The leaders of the Bolshevik group were Plekhanov and Lenin.

The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was an illegal party. It fought against the authocracy, organized meetings and strikes, printed illegal newspapers, blaming the Tsar and his government. Many members of the party were arrested, put into prison or condemned to penal servitude.

In 1917 Lenin and most Bolsheviks became a separate political party, RSDLP(B), which later became the Russian Communist Party.

During the Russian Civil War, the RSDLP was banned by Communists. Some Social Democrats became Communists, some fled from Russia, others found themself in prisons.

Negative binary numbers have to be stored in a special way. Negative decimals have a sign in front of them (e.g. -2) but inside a computer, where binary is used, there is no sign for negative - only 1s and 0s.

There are two methods for storing negative binary numbers, they are Sign and Magnitude and 2's Complement.

Sign and Magnitude works by changing the most significant bit (MSB - the first digit) to a 1 if the number is negative, for example:

Real numbers in binary

Real numbers in binary have to be stored in a special way in a computer. There is no decimal point in the binary system so the computer has a method of understanding decimals. This is called floating point representation

Real numbers are usually called decimals.

The decimal point in a real number is called a "floating point" because it can be placed anywhere - it is not fixed. Because of this, a computer will divide a number into two parts. These are called the mantissa and the exponent.

The mantissa is found by taking the real number and removing the decimal point, for example:

1101 . 0111 would become 1101 0111

The exponent is the number of spaces the decimal point has moved. In the example above, the decimal point moved 4 places to the left, so the exponent is 0000 0100 (this is binary for 4).

If the decimal point moves to right, the exponent is negative. For example,

0000 . 0111 (mantissa - 0000 0111)
<br> here, the exponent is -1. The binary number for this is 1111 1111 (see Negative binary numbers)

The result is found by putting the Mantissa and Exponent together. The results for the examples above are:

<doc id="189238" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=189238" title="Ponzi scheme">
Ponzi scheme

A Ponzi scheme is a kind of fraud. It is a kind of investment operation. Normally, if investments make a profit, this profit is shared, and distributed among those people investing money. 
A Ponzi scheme is different. It offers returns that are paid by the people investing themselves, or by other people investing, and not from the profits made. 

Ponzi schemes offer returns that are much better than those offered by other forms of investment. Returns offered are either very high, or very consistent. They have to do this, because they need to find new people who invest. Keeping the returns going that a Ponzi scheme advertises and pays requires an increasing flow of money from investors.

Many times, the system will collapse because people have to pay more than they earn, if they earn anything at all. Most of the time, the system itself does not collapse, but the authorities find it. In that case, they will stop the system, and start charging people, because running such systems is illegal in many countries. 
As more investors become involved, the likelihood of the scheme coming to the attention of authorities increases.

The scheme is named after Charles Ponzi, who became notorious for using the technique after emigrating from Italy to the United States in 1903. Ponzi did not invent the scheme (Charles Dickens' 1857 novel "Little Dorrit" described such a scheme decades before Ponzi was born, for example), but his operation took in so much money that it was the first to become known throughout the United States. His original scheme was in theory based on arbitraging international reply coupons for postage stamps, but soon diverted investors' money to support payments to earlier investors and Ponzi's personal wealth. 

Knowingly entering a Ponzi scheme, even at the last round of the scheme, can be rational in the economic sense if a government will probably bail out those participating in the Ponzi scheme.

People who advertise Ponzi schemes will often use words or phrases that sound very good, but that do not really mean much. Examples are:
The people promoting the scheme will take advantage of the fact that the investors do often not know much about economics. The Madoff scandal of 2008 showed that investors presumed to be sophisticated, such as hedge fund managers and international bankers, can also be tricked into joining a Ponzi scheme by a promoter with a well-established (if spurious) reputation for financial skill. Sometimes people also claim that they have their own investment strategy and that this strategy can only work if it is kept secret. 

Bernard Madoff, for example, only permitted one accounting firm, run by his brother-in-law, to perform audits on his hedge fund, claiming the need to keep his strategy secret.

Without the benefit of precedent or objective prior information about the investment, only a few investors are tempted, usually for small sums. Thirty days later, the investor receives the original capital plus the 20 percent return. At this point, the investor will have more incentive to put in additional money and, as word begins to spread, other investors grab the "opportunity" to participate, leading to a cascade effect deriving from the promise of extraordinary returns. However, the "return" to the initial investors is being paid out of the investments of new entrants, and not out of profits.

One reason that the scheme initially works so well is that early investors — those who actually got paid the large returns — commonly reinvest their money in the scheme (it does, after all, pay out much better than any alternative investment). Thus, those running the scheme do not actually have to pay out very much (net) — they simply have to send statements to investors showing them how much they earned by keeping the money, in order to maintain the deception that the scheme is a fund with high returns.

Promoters also try to minimize withdrawals by offering new plans to investors, often where money is frozen for a longer period of time, in exchange for higher returns. The promoter sees new cash flows as investors are told they could not transfer money from the first plan to the second. If a few investors do wish to withdraw their money in accordance with the terms allowed, the requests are usually promptly processed, which gives the illusion to all other investors that the fund is solvent.

The catch is that at some point one of three things will happen:

Baní

The Dominican city of Baní is the head municipality of the Peravia province, on the south of the country, close to the Caribbean Sea.

Baní is a Taíno word meaning "ebony" or a similar tree, but the city takes the name from the small river that goes through the city.

The municipality of Baní has an area of 743.79 km² that represents almost 94% of the total area of the small province of Peravia; the other municipality of the province is Nizao.

There are nine municipal districts in the Baní municipality (a municipal district in the Dominican Republic are similar to municipalities but they depend on a municipality). Those municipal districts are:

The western and northern part of the municipality (and of the province) has many mountains that are part of the "Cordillera Central" (in English, "Central mountain range"); this range is called here "Sierra de Ocoa".

In the southern half of the municipality there are several small valleys and savannas such as the Peravia Valley, where the city of Baní is located, and "Sabana de Paya" (Paya savanna) around the town of Paya.

West of Baní, the region is very dry and there are not many people living here except close to rivers and to the coast.

The most important rivers in this municipality are Ocoa and Baní rivers.

The municipality had, in 2002, a total population of 107,926: 52,897 men and 55,029 women. The urban population was 57.32% of the total population. In this numbers are included the population of the municipal districts of Catalina, El Carretón, El Limonal, Las Barías and Villa Sombrero.

In 1764, the people that were living in the Peravia Valley bought some land in "Cerro Gordo" (part of the valley) to build a new town. The new town was given the name of Baní after the river that is found to the east of the town.

After the independence from Haiti in 1844, the country was divided in five provinces and in 1845 Baní was made a municipality of the old Province of Santo Domingo. In 1944, Baní was made the capital city of the new province José Trujillo Valdéz, now with the name of Peravia.

Tikhon Khrennikov

Tikhon Khrennikov (born Yelets, Soviet Union, 10 June 1913; died Moscow, 14 August 2007) was a Russian musician. He was a composer and pianist He got involved in the musical politics of his country, which was then the Soviet Union. A lot of people hated him, especially in western countries. He is particularly remembered for what he did at the unpleasant conference in 1948, when some of the most famous Soviet composers, including Shostakovich and Prokofiev, were made to say they were sorry for the music they had written and that they would compose better music in future.

In the days of the Soviet Union, and especially under Stalin, musicians had to be very careful about what they did and how they composed. Music, like all arts, was supposed to make people feel that they were lucky to be living in a great country like the Soviet Union. If composers wrote music that the politicians did not like or understand, life became very difficult for them: they would not be allowed to compose, and their music could not be performed. They might even be sent to prison. Tikhon Khrennikov became Secretary to the Union of Soviet Composers in 1948, at the time when Stalin was dictator. He continued in this job until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. He made sure that all musicians obeyed their political leaders.

It is difficult for us today to judge the actions of Khrennikov fairly. He survived because he did what he was told by Soviet dictators. After the collapse of the Soviet Union he tried to say he was sorry for what he did. It is difficult to judge whether he really meant this.

Tikhon Khrennikov was the youngest of ten children, born into a family of horse traders, in the town of Yelets in the Russian province of Lipetsk in central Russia. His family started to teach him the guitar and mandolin. When he was nine he started learning the piano, and when he was 13 he started composing. Three years later he was sent to the Gnesin Academy of Music, studying with the composer Mikhail Gnesin. In 1932 he went on to the Moscow Conservatoire. He studied composition with Vissarion Shebalin and piano with the famous teacher Heinrich Neuhauss who was later the teacher of Emil Gilels and Sviatoslav Richter. 

His early works include a symphony, a piano concerto, and an opera based on the book "Into the Storm" which was based on a novel "Loneliness", a favourite book of Stalin. His music was always happy and energetic. He wrote music for 22 films and many patriotic songs. He did everything he could to please Stalin, and soon he became Secretary of the Union of Soviet Composers.

In 1948 he headed a conference at which Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Myaskovsky and Shebalin (who had been his teacher), were told that they were bad “formalists”. The word “formalist” has no meaning in music, but it was used by the politicians to describe anyone who was not obeying the politicians’ guidelines. Khrennikov said at the conference that “we will stop all manifestations of formalism and popular decadence" .

Shostakovich had given Khrennikov some friendly advice about his opera "Into the Storm", but Khrennikov had been angry about being criticized and now he could get his own back. Shostakovich made satirical remarks about Khrennikov in an opera "Rayok" which he never showed to anyone and was found amongst his papers after his death in 1975.

After the fall of the Soviet Union Khrennikov published a book "That’s the Way It Was". In this book he says that everybody had to obey political rules and he was only doing what everyone else did. However, he then wrote some bad things about Shostakovich. Khrennikov had also been an enemy of the composer Alfred Schnittke. He banned his music from being played, and was furious when it was performed in other countries. He also banned music by other composers who have now become famous such as Sofia Gubaidulina and Viktor Suslin.

Khrennikov was, however, not all bad. He supported Shostakovich and Prokofiev for getting the Stalin Prizes in the 1950s. He also invited Stravinsky, who had been exiled to the United States, to revisit the Soviet Union in 1962. 

When he was in his eighties, Khrennikov continued to compose many comic operas, operettas and ballets. They always had tunes that were easy for people to enjoy.

The Soviet state gave him many prizes for the work he did: three Stalin Prizes, a State Prize of the USSR and a Lenin Prize. Before his death he was even given an award by Vladimir Putin, which makes it seem as if Russia might be returning to its past values.

He died in Moscow aged 94.

Dialysis

Dialysis is where a machine is used to replace a kidney after kidney failure. The word "dialysis" comes from the Greek word "dialusis", "dia" meaning through, and "lusis" meaning loosening.

Dialysis can be used for people who have become sick and have lost the use of their kidneys for a short time, or for people who no longer have working kidneys. The purpose of the kidney is to keep a balance of water and minerals in the body. These minerals include sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium and sulfate. The kidneys also take out hydrogen ions from the blood. Dialysis is able to remove these wastes from the body and help keep the minerals in balance.

However the kidneys are also part of the endocrine system and make erythropoietin and calcitriol. Dialysis machines are not able to replace this part of the kidney's function.

Dialysis machines work by using diffusion and ultrafiltration. A very fine material, called a membrane, allows blood and fluid to flow through it. In the machine, the blood flows in one direction, and on the other side of the membrane, a special fluid, dialysate flows in the opposite direction. Dialysate is a fluid that has different chemicals in it, such as potassium and calcium. A doctor would decide what mixture of chemicals would be needed for each patient. The dialysate has bicarbonate in it to lower the higher acid levels that these patients often have. The blood and dialysate mix together. The waste products are removed from the blood and caught up in the fine membrane.

Kinkajou

The kinkajou is a mammal of the family Procyonidae and it is related to the raccoon, coati, olingo, raingtail and cacomistle. It lives in the rainforests of South America and Central America, and spends most of its time on trees. It can eat both meat and plants and has a gripping tail that can be used like an arm. It is an endangered species because it is being hunted for its fur, meat and to be illegally sold as pets.

Although kinkajous may look like monkeys or ferrets, they are not related to those animals. An adult kinkajou's weight is between 1-3 kg (3-7 lb). Its body can grow up to 43-56 cm long (17-22 in) and its tail usually measures between 16-22 cm (41- 56 in). The kinkajou has woolly fur consisting of an outer golden (brownish-gray) coat and another gray coat underneath.

The Barber of Seville

The Barber of Seville (in Italian: Il barbiere di Siviglia) is a comic opera (opera buffa) in two acts by the composer Gioachino Rossini. The libretto (words) are based on a comedy by Pierre Beaumarchais called "The Barber of Seville". It is Rossini’s most famous opera, containing some very well known tunes.

The first performance took place on 20 February, 1816 in Rome

Rossini’s opera was not the first one to be based on Beaumarchais' play. The composer Giovanni Paisiello had written one with the same title, and another was composed in 1796 by Nicolas Isouard. Paisiello’s opera was popular for a time, but soon Rossini’s opera became famous and Paisiello’s opera was forgotten.

Mozart's opera "Le nozze di Figaro," composed in 1786 is also based on the same play, but it deals with the second part of the play (the play was in three parts).

Rossini is well known for being able to compose very quickly. He composed all the music for "The Barber of Seville" in less than three weeks. He borrowed the overture from something he had written earlier. 

When the opera was first performed on 20 February 1816 it was a big failure. The audience hissed and jeered the whole time, and there were several little accidents on the stage. At one point a cat walked onto the stage.

The second time it was performed it was a great success.

"The square in front of Dr. Bartolo's house"

The story takes place in the town of Seville in Spain. It is supposed to be the 17th century. In a town square outside Dr. Bartolo's house a band of musicians are serenading outside the window of Rosina. Among them is Lindoro, who is pretending to be a poor student, but he is really Count Almaviva in disguise. He hopes that Rosina will love him. He pays the musicians who then leave.

Figaro comes in. He used to be Almaviva’s servant. The aria that he sings is very famous. It is called "Largo al factotum". Almaviva asks him to help him meet Rosina, offering him money if he can do it. Figaro says he should disguise himself as a soldier and pretend to be drunk and to try and get into the house. 

Inside Dr Bartolo’s house Rosina sings a song "Una voce poco fa" ("A voice just now"). 
Rosina writes to the Count, calling him Lindoro, because she thinks that is his name. As she is leaving the room, Bartolo and Basilio enter. Bartolo is suspicious of the Count, and Basilio says that they should start to tell bad stories about him to get him out of the way.

When they are gone, Rosina and Figaro enter. Figaro asks Rosina to write a short note to Lindoro. She has already done this. She is surprised by Bartolo, but she manages to fool him.

Berta, Dr Bartolo’s servant, tries to leave the house. She is met by the Count disguised as an drunken soldier. Bartolo cannot get rid of the Count, who manages to have a quick word with Rosina. He whispers to her that he is called Lindoro and gives her a letter. Bartolo is watching and is suspicious. He wants to know what the letter is about, but Rosina fools him by giving him a list of things to be washed. Bartolo and the Count start arguing. Basilio, Figaro and Berta appear and the noise is heard by the Officer of the Watch and his men. Bartolo thinks that the Count has been arrested, but Almaviva tells the officer his real name and he is immediately released. Bartolo and Basilio cannot understand why this happened. Rosina laughs at them.

"Dr. Bartolo's house"

Almaviva comes to the doctor’s house again. This time he is disguised as a music teacher. He is pretending that Basilio is ill and that he has come instead. At first Bartolo is suspicious but he soon lets him in when he shows him Rosina’s letter. He gives Rosina a singing lesson. Bartolo things that Lindoro is one of the Count’s servants and that he is trying to get girls for the Count. Bartolo does not want to leave him alone with Rosina, so he gets Figaro (who is a barber) to shave him.
When Basilio suddenly appears, Almaviva bribes him with some money and he goes away saying he is sick. Bartolo realizes in the end that it is a trick, and gets everyone out of the room. He goes to a notary to get a marriage contract made between himself and Rosina. He shows Rosina the letter she wrote to "Lindoro", and makes her think that Lindoro is a servant and cunning friend of Almaviva.

The stage is empty while the music creates a thunder storm. The Count and Figaro climb up a ladder to the balcony and enter the room through a window. Rosina shows Almaviva the letter and says she is very sad. Almaviva tells her who he really is. Rosina now loves him. Figaro tells them they should leave. Basilio and the notary come to the front door and try to leave by the ladder, but it has gone. Basilio can either take a bribe a be a witness to the marriage or he can be shot dead. He decides, together with Figaro, to witness the signing of the marriage contract between the Count and Rosina. Bartolo rushes in, but is too late. The Bartolo (who was the one who had taken away the ladder) is made happy when he is told he can keep Rosina's dowry.

Marten

The Marten is a small mammal in the family Martes family. There are eight species. They live in the Northern Hemisphere, and are found in North America, Canada, Europe and Asia.

Martens are carnivores (they eat meat) that mainly hunt at night. They have thin bodies, long, bushy tails, short legs and pointed faces. Their fur is usually brown with pale chest. Martens live in forests and with their claws that are just like cat's they are easily able to climb trees. They live by themselves and do not like other martens living too close to them. They eat mostly small mammals like squirrels, voles, mice, rabbits, but also fish, insects, eggs and sometimes fruits (mostly berries) when available. 

They meet to mate in late spring or early summer and have up to five babies. Little martens, called 'kits', are born blind and naked in early spring, after long gestation.

Hi folks! Here is my second SN article.

Hope you all had a great 2 weeks. I remember saying last time that we were only 264 short of 60,000 articles. However, I’m sad to say that this margin has now increased to 3,005 5000+ (!) :( Most of you will know that this is the result of the mass deletion of several hundreds of articles. It has been a concern for all of us that several articles which have been created are one-line stubs on non-notable subjects. 

I believe that we should follow a particular list of notable, uncreated articles which should be created by us. This is not like . Articles to be included should be important people, FA/GAs from other projects and businesses having large number of Google hits. Also, we should strive to eradicate stubs and so I usher all users to join .

Unfortunately, yesterday left SEWP after an argument regarding the mass deletion of articles without the flood flag. It'll surely be a bit difficult without him, but anyway, we should not let it be a hindrance for us.

This is all for now. Hope to see you again next time. Bye, 16:20, 2 July 2009 (UTC).

Brantford was an big Canadian city for making goods from 1900 to 1950, exporting many goods. The city is on a river, theGrand River, and had a railroad. Having both water and rails helped Brantford go from a farming town to an industrial city.

By the 1980s and 1990s, business in Brantford was dropping and some companies like White Farm Equipment, Massey-Ferguson, Koering-Waterous, Harding Carpets, and others stopped making products. Many people lost their jobs. Since then, some jobs have come back.

A new piece of highway (Highway 403) was built in 1997, for easy driving to Hamilton and Toronto, and also to Detroit and Buffalo. So, in 2004, Procter & Gamble and Ferrero SpA moved to Brantford.

<doc id="189506" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=189506" title="Historical geology">
Historical geology

The Historical geology is used by geologists and other scientists to describe the timing and relationships between events that have occurred during the history of Earth. The table of geological periods presented here agrees with the dates and nomenclature proposed by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, and uses the standard color codes of the United States Geological Survey.

Evidence from radiometric dating indicates that the Earth is about 4.570 billion years old. The geological or "deep time" of Earth's past has been organized into various units according to events which took place in each period. Different spans of time on the time scale are usually delimited by major geological or palaeontological events, such as mass extinctions. For example, the boundary between the Cretaceous period and the Palaeogene period is defined by the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event, which marked the demise of the dinosaurs and of many marine species. Older periods which predate the reliable fossil record are defined by absolute age.

The largest defined unit of time is the supereon composed of Eons. Eons are divided into Eras, which are in turn divided into Periods, Epochs and Stages. At the same time paleontologists define a system of faunal stages, of varying lengths, based on changes in the observed fossil assemblages. In many cases, such faunal stages have been adopted in building the geological nomenclature, though in general there are far more recognized faunal stages than defined geological time units.

Geologists tend to talk in terms of Upper/Late, Lower/Early and Middle parts of periods and other units , such as "Upper Jurassic", and "Middle Cambrian". "Upper", "Middle", and "Lower" are terms applied to the rocks themselves, as in "Upper Jurassic sandstone," while "Late", "Middle", and "Early" are applied to time, as in "Early Jurassic deposition" or "fossils of Early Jurassic age." The adjectives are capitalized when the subdivision is formally recognized, and lower case when not; thus "early Miocene" but "Early Jurassic." Because geologic units occurring at the same time but from different parts of the world can often look different and contain different fossils, there are many examples where the same period was historically given different names in different locales. For example, in North America the Lower Cambrian is referred to as the Waucoban series that is then subdivided into zones based on trilobites. The same timespan is split into Tommotian, Atdabanian and Botomian stages in East Asia and Siberia. A key aspect of the work of the International Commission on Stratigraphy is to reconcile this conflicting terminology and define universal horizons that can be used around the world.

The principles underlying geologic (geological) time scales were laid down by Nicolaus Steno in the late 17th century. Steno argued that rock layers (or strata) are laid down in succession, and that each represents a "slice" of time. He also formulated the principle of superposition, which states that any given stratum is probably older than those above it and younger than those below it. While Steno's principles were simple, applying them to real rocks proved complex. Over the course of the 18th century geologists realized that: 

The first serious attempts to formulate a geological time scale that could be applied anywhere on Earth took place in the late 18th century. The most influential of those early attempts (championed by Abraham Werner, among others) divided the rocks of the Earth's crust into four types: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. Each type of rock, according to the theory, formed during a specific period in Earth history. It was thus possible to speak of a "Tertiary Period" as well as of "Tertiary Rocks." Indeed, "Tertiary" (now Palaeocene-Pliocene) and "Quaternary" (now Pleistocene-Holocene) remained in use as names of geological periods well into the 20th century.

In opposition to the then-popular Neptunist theories expounded by Werner (that all rocks had precipitated out of a single enormous flood), a major shift in thinking came with the reading by James Hutton of his "Theory of the Earth; or, an Investigation of the Laws Observable in the Composition, Dissolution, and Restoration of Land Upon the Globe" before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in March and April 1785, events which "as things appear from the perspective of the twentieth century, James Hutton in those reading became the founder of modern geology" What Hutton proposed was that the interior of the Earth was hot, and that this heat was the engine which drove the creation of new rock: land was eroded by air and water and deposited as layers in the sea; heat then consolidated the sediment into stone, and uplifted it into new lands. This theory was dubbed "Plutonist" in contrast to the flood-oriented theory.

The identification of strata by the fossils they contained, pioneered by William Smith, Georges Cuvier, Jean d'Omalius d'Halloy and Alexandre Brogniart in the early 19th century, enabled geologists to divide Earth history more precisely. It also enabled them to correlate strata across national (or even continental) boundaries. If two strata (however distant in space or different in composition) contained the same fossils, chances were good that they had been laid down at the same time. Detailed studies between 1820 and 1850 of the strata and fossils of Europe produced the sequence of geological periods still used today. 

The process was dominated by British geologists, and the names of the periods reflect that dominance. The "Cambrian," (the Roman name for Wales) and the "Ordovician," and "Silurian", named after ancient Welsh tribes, were periods defined using stratigraphic sequences from Wales. The "Devonian" was named for the English county of Devon, and the name "Carboniferous" was simply an adaptation of "the Coal Measures," the old British geologists' term for the same set of strata. The "Permian" was named after Perm, Russia, because it was defined using strata in that region by a Scottish geologist Roderick Murchison. However, some periods were defined by geologists from other countries. The "Triassic" was named in 1834 by a German geologist Friedrich Von Alberti from the three distinct layers (Latin "trias" meaning triad) —red beds, capped by chalk, followed by black shales— that are found throughout Germany and Northwest Europe, called the 'Trias'. The "Jurassic" was named by a French geologist Alexandre Brogniart for the extensive marine limestone exposures of the Jura Mountains. The "Cretaceous" (from Latin "creta" meaning 'chalk') as a separate period was first defined by a Belgian geologist Jean d'Omalius d'Halloy in 1822, using strata in the Paris basin and named for the extensive beds of chalk (calcium carbonate deposited by the shells of marine invertebrates). 

British geologists were also responsible for the grouping of periods into Eras and the subdivision of the Tertiary and Quaternary periods into epochs.

When William Smith and Sir Charles Lyell first recognized that rock strata represented successive time periods, time scales could be estimated only very imprecisely since various kinds of rates of change used in estimation were highly variable. While creationists had been proposing dates of around six or seven thousand years for the age of the Earth based on the Bible, early geologists were suggesting millions of years for geologic periods with some even suggesting a virtually infinite age for the Earth. Geologists and paleontologists constructed the geologic table based on the relative positions of different strata and fossils, and estimated the time scales based on studying rates of various kinds of weathering, erosion, sedimentation, and lithification. Until the discovery of radioactivity in 1896 and the development of its geological applications through radiometric dating during the first half of the 20th century (pioneered by such geologists as Arthur Holmes) which allowed for more precise absolute dating of rocks, the ages of various rock strata and the age of the Earth were the subject of considerable debate.

In 1977, the "Global Commission on Stratigraphy" (now the International Commission on Stratigraphy) started an effort to define global references (Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points) for geologic periods and faunal stages. The commission's most recent work is described in the 2004 geologic time scale of Gradstein et al.. A UML model for how the timescale is structured, relating it to the GSSP, is also available.

The following table summarizes the major events and characteristics of the periods of time making up the geologic time scale. As above, this time scale is based on the International Commission on Stratigraphy. The height of each table entry does not correspond to the duration of each subdivision of time.

1) In North America, the Carboniferous is subdivided into Mississippian and Pennsylvanian Periods

2) Discoveries in the past quarter century have substantially changed the view of geologic and paleontologic events immediately prior to the Cambrian. The nomenclature has not stabilized. The term Neoproterozoic is used here, but other writers might equally well have used one or more of the terms 'Ediacarian', 'Vendian', 'Varangian', 'Precambrian', 'Protocambrian', 'Eocambrian', or might have extended the Cambrian further back in time. All of these terms are usually treated as a subset of the Proterozoic rather than a period between the Palaeozoic and the Proterozoic.

3) Dates are slightly uncertain with differences of a few percent between various sources being common. This is largely due to uncertainties in radiometric dating and the problem that deposits suitable for radiometric dating seldom occur exactly at the places in the geologic column where we would most like to have them. Dates with an * are radiometrically determined based on internationally agreed to GSSPs. All dates given are for the end of the epoch in question.

4) Paleontologists often refer to faunal stages rather than geologic Periods. The Stage Nomenclature is quite complex. See http://flatpebble.nceas.ucsb.edu/public/harland.html for an excellent time ordered list of faunal stages. Also see the article on GSSPs.

5) In common usage the Tertiary-Quaternary and Palaeogene-Neogene-Quaternary Periods are treated as equivalents to the Mesozoic and Palaeozoic Periods. The term 'Period|Age' (e.g. 'Neogene Period|Age') is sometimes used instead of 'Period'.

6) The time shown in the "Years Ago" column is that of the end of the Epoch in the "Epoch" column.

The Swell Season

The Swell Season are Glen Hansard, from the Irish band, "The Frames", and Marketa Irglova, a classically trained Czech pianist and singer. They won the Academy Award for Best Song in 2008.

The pop/rock duo made their first recording, "The Swell Season", in 2006. This was just after the release of the Frames' sixth CD, "The Cost". Hansard and Irglová also appeared as working-class immigrants in the popular Irish movie, "Once", which was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007. The following year, they won an Oscar, the Academy Award for Best Song for the film's hit single, "Falling Slowly,". Hansard became the first Irish-born person to win in that category. Irglová became the first Czech woman to win an Oscar, and at age 19, she is the youngest person to win an Oscar in a musical category.
The Swell Season became famous as a result. The soundtrack recording, "Once: Music from the Motion Picture" went gold in February 2008. They went on tour and performed to sold-out crowds in many countries.

During the tour, Hansard and Irglová began dating. Hansard said, "I had been falling in love with her for a long time, but I kept telling myself she's just a kid". Hansard and Irglová also recorded a version of Bob Dylan's "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" for the movie "I'm Not There" in 2007. In 2009, Hansard said that he and Irglova were no longer romantically linked, and that they are now "good friends."

Hansard and Irglová performed the song live on the Oscar broadcast at Los Angeles' Kodak Theater on February 24, 2008. When they went on stage to receive their awards, her acceptance speech was stopped by the orchestra's music cue to leave the stage. Host Jon Stewart asked her back to deliver her speech following the commercial break. Ceremony director Gil Cates said the early cue was an accident.

She said:
“Hi everyone. I just want to thank you so much. This is such a big deal, not only for us, but for all other independent musicians and artists that spend most of their time struggling, and this, the fact that we’re standing here tonight, the fact that we’re able to hold this, it’s just the proof that no matter how far out your dreams are, it’s possible. And, you know, fair play to those who dare to dream and don’t give up. And this song was written from a perspective of hope, and hope at the end of the day connects us all, no matter how different we are. And so thank you so much, who helped us along way. Thank you.”

Ted Stevens

Ted Stevens (November 8, 1923 - August 9, 2010) was a Republican U.S. Senator from Alaska. He served in the Senate for 40 years until he lost in 2008. He was at one time "President Pro Tempore of the Senate," meaning he was the longest-serving Senator of the party in power at the time and could lead the Senate if the Vice President was absent. He is known for bringing large amounts of money to Alaska in the form of "pork barrel" projects. This is because he was the chair of the Appropriations Committee, which gives money to states and projects. He is also known for the "series of tubes" analogy that he used to describe the Internet. The airport in Anchorage is named after him. Stevens was born in Indianapolis and lived in Chicago and Manhattan Beach, California before moving to Alaska. In 2010, Stevens died in a plane crash in Alaska at the age of 86.

Joy of Giving Week

The Joy of Giving Week (JGW), planned for Sept 27 - Oct 3, 2009 as a national movement, aims at engaging at least one crore Indians in different ""acts of giving"" - "money, time, resources and skills"- spanning the corporate, NGO and government sectors, schools, colleges and the general public. The idea is to create a ""festival of philanthropy"" that can, over the years, become a part of the Indian ethos, with the Week being celebrated every year covering Gandhi Jayanti. The Week is designed as a ""public platform"" and is being co-ordinated by GiveIndia, a non for profit organization whose mission is to promote "Giving". GiveIndia has earlier initiated public giving activities like the Mumbai and Delhi marathons and runs the largest Payroll Giving programme in the country across 40 companies.

The "Joy of Giving Week" was launched in Mumbai on June 3 in front of the media and was covered by 22 news channels and over 40 publications and a press meet was scheduled in Chennai on June 30. And soon, the campaign would launched before media in Hyderabad and various other cities.

Several corporates, celebrities and organisations have already finalized their efforts towards awareness, volunteering and fundraising events that they will organize during the "Joy of Giving Week".

A brief outline on some of the initiatives that are taking place during the Week.

Hi guys! This is my 9th article for Simple News.

Firstly I'm very sorry about what happened on Saturday; Bluegoblin7 decided to leave us after an argument with other users. It is very sad, but we shouldn't let this get in our ways.

As always we need help with the and processes.

Also, I've started a New section called "Song of the Fortnight", just for a bit of fun following my wikipedia ("I do not have an entry...") song. We should be able to have a song per edition.

Next, I'd like to talk about 'my new wikiproject: . Its objective is to highly reduce the number of stubs on simple wiki. Just join, follow the instructions and off we go!

Finally I'd like to talk to you about a new possible section on SN; a "story" which would include satire. I'd like to know if anyone objected to this', and if you do or don't please say so on page. Please remember, if it existed none of it should be taken seriously of course; it's just for fun and to make SN better. I'd write a Chapter for every edition.

More to come in further editions, 21:51, 4 July 2009 (UTC)

Australovenator

Australovenator wintonensis is a medium-sized theropod dinosaur that lived in Australia about 100 million years ago. 

The fossil bones of the dinosaur was found at an ancient billabong near Winton, Queensland. Scientists have called him "Banjo", after the famous Australian poet, Banjo Patterson. Patterson wrote the song Waltzing Matilda after a visit to Winton in 1885. The name "Australovenator wintonensis" comes from the Latin words "Austral" meaning from the south, "venator" meaning hunter, and "wintonensis" meaning from Winton.

The dinosaur was discovered in 2009, with several dinosaurs, such as the sauropods "Diamantinasaurus" and "Wintonotitan". It is the most complete theropod skeleton found in Australia.

"Banjo" was a medium-sized, fast, canivorous (meat eating) dinosaur with three large, sharp claws on each hand. It stood about two meters tall. Dinosaur expert, Scott Hocknull, described Australovenator wintonensis as being like a cheetah.

Elizabeth Cross

The Elizabeth Cross is an award within the British honours system that is issued to the next of kin of a service man or woman who died due to enemy action or terrorism since 1949. The award comes with a memorial that contains the dead persons name, when they died and has the Queen's signature on it. It is the most recent medal, honour or award to bear the name of a reigning monarch of the United Kingdom since the George Cross. It is not an award for or bravery. It is in the shape of a cross with four equal sides that contains flowers at the end of each arm that represents the four countries within the union of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The medal also contains a laurel wreath behind the cross and bears the dead person's name on the back. The medal comes with a miniature (small version) medal for day wear. The medal can only be worn by the next of kin and for anyone else to wear it (even if related to the person who died) is a criminal offence.

Corrosive substance

Corrosive substances are substances that can damage tissues when they come in contact with them. An example of a corrosive substance is the liquid, hydrochloric acid, an acid used in some toilet bowl cleaners. Corrosive is one of the five danger risks that a liquid can have, along with toxic, flammable, explosive, and biological hazard.

Malus

Malus (), the apples, is a genus of about 30–35 species of small deciduous trees or shrubs in the family Rosaceae. Other studies go as far as to say it includes 55 species including the domesticated Orchard Apple, or Table apple as it used to be called ("M. domestica", derived from "M. sieversii", syn. "M. pumila"). The other species and subspecies are generally known as "wild apples", "crab apples", "crabapples" or "crabs".

The genus is native to the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, in Europe, Asia and North America.

Apple trees are small, usually 4–12 m tall when full grown. The leaves are 3–10 cm long, positioned opposite from each other. They have a simple shape with a saw-tooth edge. The flowers come from corymbs, and have five petals, which may be white, pink or red, with usually red stamens that produce lots of pollen, and an ovary which is below them. Flowering takes place in the spring after 50–80 growing degree days (this varies a lot according to subspecies and cultivar). Apples need to be pollinated from one tree to another by insects (typically bees, which freely visit the flowers for both nectar and pollen). All are unable to pollinate themselves, and (with the exception of a few specially developed cultivars) self-pollination is impossible, making pollinating insects required. 

For "Malus sylvestris domestica", see Apple. The fruit of the other species is not an important crop in most areas because they are very sour and (in some species) very like wood, and are rarely eaten raw for this reason. However, crabapples are an excellent source of pectin, and their juice can be made into a ruby-coloured jelly.Some kinds of crab apples make good applesauce.

Crabapples are widely grown as trees for the pleasure of their appearance, grown for their beautiful flowers or fruit. There are cultivars selected for these qualities and for resistance to disease. 

Some crab apples are used as rootstocks for domestic apples to stand up to cold or drought. 

They are also used as tree for pollinating food apple trees in apple orchards. Varieties of crab apple are selected to bloom at the same time as the apple trees in an orchard, and the crabs are planted every sixth or seventh tree, or limbs of a crab tree are grafted onto some of the apple trees. See also Fruit tree pollination.

Because of the many blossoms and small sized fruit, crab apples are popular for use in bonsai. Because the trees are small due to the needs of the hobby, but still show the abundant fruit bearing of full-sized crab apples, it is important to thin out fruit so that trees do not stress themselves.

Apple wood "makes a wonderfully firewood with a lovely scent [smell], and smoke from an apple wood fire gives a most excellent flavour to smoked foods," including Applewood cheese.

<doc id="190022" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190022" title="Operation Ichi-Go">
Operation Ichi-Go

Operation Ichi-Go (or "Operation Number One") was a series of battles between the armies of Japan and China. The battles happened between April and December 1944. There were three battles in the Chinese provinces of Henan, Hunan and Guangxi. The goals of Operation Ichi-go were to make a route to French Indochina and to capture bases that American bombers were using to attack Japan and her shipping.

There were two parts to the operation. In the first part, the Japanese secured the Railway between Beijing and Wuhan. In the second part they destroyed the US air forces in Hunan province and reached the city of Liuzhou. Liuzhou was near the border with Japanese-occupied Indochina. 

400,000 men, 12,000 vehicles and 70,000 horses took part in operation Ichi-Go. The Japanese army included the very well trained Kwantung Army units and equipment from Manchukuo, North China and Japan. It was the largest land operation by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Many of the new American-trained Chinese units were fighting in Burma under General Joseph Stilwell using weapons leased from the United States. Chiang Kai-Shek had agreed that Stilwell could manage the distribution of American arms. 

In "Operation Kogo", 390,000 Chinese soldiers, led by General Tang Enbo, defended Luoyang. The Japanese 3rd Tank Division crossed the Yellow River around Zhengzhou in late April and defeated the Chinese near Xuchang. They then moved around and put Luoyang under . Luoyang was defended by three Chinese divisions. The 3rd Tank Division began to attack on May 13 and won Luoyang on May 25.

The second part of Ichigo began in May. Japanese forces moved south and occupied Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin and Liuzhou. In December 1944, Japanese forces reached French Indochina and completed the operation. Despite this success, US air forces moved inland from the threatened bases near the coast. The U.S. Air Force often stopped the railway between Beijing and Liuzhou that had been started in Operation Ichigo. Japan continued to attack airfields where US air forces were stationed up to the spring of 1945. 

USA's XX Bomber Command using B-29 bombers of the which were attacking Japan were forced to move as well. But this affected their efficiency for only a short time. In early 1945 the Twentieth Air Force moved to newly established bases in the Marianas under the command of the newly established XXI Bomber Command.

The failure to hold the coastal airfields led to a loss of confidence in General Joseph Stilwell by Chiang Kai-shek. Stilwell was replaced in October 1944 by President Roosevelt. The new Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-Shek and commander of the U.S. Forces in China was Major General Albert Wedemeyer. Stillwell's other responsibilities in China, Burma and India were given to other officers.

A very different version of events was that General Joseph Stilwell was asking for a fuller use of Chinese forces and had made diplomatic connections with the Chinese Red Army commanded by Mao Zedong. They had agreed to follow an American commander. 

Because Chiang Kai-shek was ignored by the American general, he had Stilwell called back to the United States. "New York Times" reporter Brooks Atkinson wrote at the time: The decision to relieve General Stilwell represents the political triumph of a moribund, anti-democratic regime that is more concerned with maintaining its political supremacy than in driving the Japanese out of China. America is now committed... to support a regime that has become increasingly unpopular and mistrusted in China, that maintains three secret police services and concentration camps for political prisoners, that stifles free speech and resists democratic forces... The Chinese Communists... have good armies that are now fighting guerrilla warfare against the Japanese in North China... The Generalissimo regards these armies as the chief threat to his supremacy... has made no sincere attempt to arrange at least a truce with them for the duration of the war... No diplomatic genius could have overcome the Generalissimo's basic unwillingness to risk his armies in battle with the Japanese...
But the "Time Magazine" article in which Atkinson was quoted went on to talk about the true failure of Stilwell's goals by saying that: The Chinese, exhausted by seven years of almost singlehanded war against Japan, were reluctant to give General Stilwell the troops he wanted for the Burma offensive; the Japs might suddenly crack down on them in earnest. When the Japs began the drive that last week seemed on the verge of cutting China in two, Chiang Kai-shek's Government might well have felt that its go-slow policy was justified..." 

This loss and the poor opinion in the U.S.A. caused the Americans to lose confidence in the Chinese troops. Instead the U.S. focused all its resources on the island-to-island war in the Pacific.

Black Sea

The Black Sea is a sea in Eurasia between Europe, Caucasus, and Anatolia. Many big rivers connect to the Black Sea, like Don, Danube, and Dnieper rivers.

It is connected to the Atlantic ocean through the Mediterranean Sea, Aegean Sea, and many straits. 90% of the sea has no oxygen, and the water has salt in it. During the last ice age, the Black Sea was a freshwater lake.

In Greek mythology, the Argonauts traveled on the sea. The sea was very important to trade for many countries in ancient history. It was also important during World War I and World War II.

The Black Sea sits on continental plates which have subsided. It is a geologic basin, and therefore is a genuine inland sea. Its maximum depth is about 2000 metres. The Black Sea is the world’s largest basin where the deep waters do not mix with the upper layers of water that receive oxygen from the atmosphere. As a result, over 90% of the deeper Black Sea volume is anoxic water. The upper layers are generally cooler, less dense and less salty than the deeper waters, as they are fed by large river systems, whereas the deep waters come from the warm, salty waters of the Mediterranean.
