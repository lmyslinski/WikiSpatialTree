As has been noted on his talk page, has been a persistent nuisance on en:Wikipedia, using multiple sockpuppets including w:User:Tharnton345 after first appearing as w:User:Fila3466757. He has also edited from a range of IP addresses, including 78.148.240.181, which are registered to Opal Telecom DS. . . () 09:47, 27 September 2008 (UTC)

This page has been deleted 6 times now. The last time, it was salted for about one day (expires 21:27, 4 October 2008). Then (23:37, 4 October), two hours and ten minutes it was recreated "again". I think its time we upped the protection time to a week, or, indef protect. It doesn't appear to be notable, and en.wiki doesn't have an article either. So if and when you guys get tired of deleting it... 00:14, 5 October 2008 (UTC)

The actions of user Winger84 are in bad taste and may be breaking Wikipedia rules. This apparent attempt to "out" someone is way out of line and without merit. Winger84 has been blocked twice for breaking rules. He needs to be banned, as his actions show he has not learned to follow the rules. () 11:42, 5 October 2008 (UTC)

Hi all. I would like to request either indefinite full move protection for or something else like that, as well as indefinite semi/full protection for all components of the Geobox series of templates. These templates are all uniquely tuned to make all the Geobox templates work correctly, and if any vandal were to move any of these pages or change any part of them, it could cause drastic errors throughout many thousands of articles on this site. While I am not demanding it, I would like to note that this is somewhat important as these templates are very vulnerable right now. Cheers, 22:51, 10 October 2008 (UTC)

This artist has become increasingly annoying. Here's the tally

Short of contacting her (info" at "terryananny.com), can we rangeblock this vandal? () 23:12, 11 October 2008 (UTC)

Terry Ananny (hi, Google!) is not our conventional vandal. All of the listed IPs are throwaways. She vandalizes once and then switches them. To warn her does no good. She's clearly read the RFD and knows why we deleted her article but she continues to recreate it. () 07:08, 12 October 2008 (UTC)

My RfA is due to end today, 19th October. However as there is no clear consensus (7 supports, 5 opposes) I wondered if it could be extended for a while? I thought I would ask rather than just let it run over, cheers. 15:46, 19 October 2008 (UTC)

It appears that this user learned little from his recent one-year ban. This week has chosen to (in his own words, yet), "butt in" after I answered a personal attack from concerning the graphic used on Amplitude modulation and Frequency modulation. Jonas has accused me of "biting a newcomer", and thinks he needs to explain to me again and again the purposes and guidelines to this wiki. Meanwhile he accuses me of "rudeness" and of "ageism", while he in turn makes backhanded and overt insults, talks down to me, calls me an "anonymous expert", etc. and does essentially the same things he has accused me of. (Is there such a thing as "reverse ageism"? Maybe.)

Berserkerus has a history on Russian Wikipedia (which I checked out; it appears Jonas didn't), so I am sure he is no stranger to Wikipedia norms and expectations. (I also believe he can fight his own battles, and does not need Jonas's help that way.) Berserkerus's attack on me was unwarranted; I did not create the graphic he chose to replace, and he should have directed his words to the person who created it, if he is so convinced the original graphic is "non-sense" and "a lie", as he insisted on my talk page. To my experience, his graphic is inferior to the one that was replaced, and his comments belong on the graphic's talk page (or its creator's, or the article's), not my personal talk page. (Which I told him in a reply. And which he chose to ignore.)

For the record, I am a graduate of a broadcasting school, as well as college. I worked in radio. I have worked with oscilloscopes (which the graphics in question emulate), and their virtual equivalents. My "sources" are my years of schooling and job experience; not all of it came through textbooks. Not all of it is documentable. Meanwhile, I notice neither Berserkerus nor Jonas have provided "documented sources" such as the latter has demanded from me (while derisively calling me an "anonymous expert"). Call it OR if you want to, but facts are facts, and I'm pretty sure neither my profs nor my eyes lied to me in those years. (Jonas did provide links to other graphics on my talk page, as his "sources"; the last two "actually support the original graphic", and in my opinion undermine that part of both their arguments.)

I advised Jonas politely after his first message to me that he would do better to let others handle the situation, considering both his history and the fact that he is not an admin. (His lack of maturity shows plainly in his ongoing comments and attitude.) He chose instead to go on the attack, and continues to do so. I believe that to let this matter lie would only encourage him to develop an even worse attitude than he already shows. I would set my education, my life experience, and my edit history against his, anytime, and I suspect the reason he has come on so strongly toward me is that I turned down an invitation to join a separate wiki he created last year. (This after checking out his prior history. I also wasn't interested in the topic.) 

This matter drew the attention of , who chose to "award" me a "Vandalism Barnstar" on the grounds that I "don't understand what vandalism is", and "confused" him. Forgive me. I saw a good graphic replaced with a poor one (whose characters were not in English), and where I come from, a "berserker" is someone out to cause trouble, and/or indulge in carelessness. I used the automated setup to revert the graphic, and send a notice; "vandalism" was the closest default to what I saw in the situation. - I do not need this hassle, from any of the parties mentioned, particularly from less-authoritative, less-experienced persons. (Especially those who have less-than-clean records on Wikipedia, and talk more than they listen or reason. By this I mean Jonas, most of all.)

I do not have a problem with this boy's age in itself. I presently work as a teacher, and if a student knows something I don't on a topic, I invite them to speak up, and to correct me if necessary, and I make sure their classmates hear the correction. My problem is with the attitude I continue to see coming from him, which to me is little different from the kind that gets a student sent to the office. (I write referrals on students as I see the need, and call parents likewise. That's not an option here, but a notice is, and I did warn him previously. He chose to ignore the warning, and tried instead to give me "lessons" on what Wikipedia is.)

Sharing what I know and have learned in a forum such as this should be a pleasure. Situations like this make it a chore, and a waste of time... not just for myself, I'm sure. Since Jonas doesn't want to hear about it from me (and he and Berserkerus only seem to be encouraged by stressing me out), I would appreciate an admin stepping in at this time. () 19:41, 26 October 2008 (UTC)

I have no problem with "expertise". However, this is a subject many have worked on, and if this is true, it has to have been documented somewhere. You had to learn this somewhere, it was not just a voice of wisdom that whispered to you. I am not saying someone had to "teach" you, but you had to have seen this before. Now that you've claimed expertise, made a contentious edit about the subject (regardless of the order in which it was done), and refused to give sources, please identify yourself according to , on your user page. I have no intention of "stressing you out", Zephyrad. However, I wasn't being ageistic, and if you considered what I did rude, you need to realize that when you do something questionable (like make undocumented and contested claims without telling who you really are) and are called upon it, the proper thing to do would be to 1) cite some source(s), 2) provide your real name and qualifications, and/or 3) admit that it was all a lie and leave. Do not report me and accuse me of hypocrisy and put emphasis on my one-year block.

Whether I am an admin, an adult, or a previously blocked editor is irrelevant. Quit being fallacious and trying to deflect attention to the real issue, which is your anonymous claims of expert knowledge. As for accusing Gwib and FSM of sockpuppetry, I raised the possibility of the latter after Creol made a dramafest out of it, and I had a small suspicion that the former used MindTheGap to troll about Benniguy, but I realized that it was stupid. I never accused him of sockpuppetry. —  ( · ) 20:47, 26 October 2008 (UTC)

I do agree to mentorship, and no offense Da Punk, but I would like a more experienced user to do it. I thank you for your efforts during my ban, it was much appreciated. —  ( · ) 00:51, 29 October 2008 (UTC)
I'm pretty sure a week's passed. Jonas hasn't been assigned a mentor. He has got another warning, this time for posting IRC logs. I therefore propose I , and mentor Jonas. However, I would like to have a admin co-mentor in case I need to block (and to satify Jonas's want of someone with experence). I'm thinking , or . If anyone is interested, can they please post here or on my talk page.

I will do a draft mentoring plan in , based off . -- 21:29, 3 November 2008 (UTC)

Sorry Creol. I should have relized he never liked you :). Shapiros10 - yeah, I'm happy to have you as a backup (I actually will be away 3/1/09 for 2 weeks (elapsing my ENWP ban end date)). Gwib - might be best if your co-mentor. -- 00:30, 4 November 2008 (UTC)

Hello, the mentoring plan proposed by Da Punk '95 looks good. I accept the mentorship, and Shapiros10 and Gwib, being experienced in English Wikipedia and Simple English Wikipedia respectively, would be good mentors. I am however curious about one point: does Wikipedia: space include this or Simple Talk? I think that may be a bit excessive, because I cannot offer any solutions to the community or give my two cents in a community discussion. What is the purpose for this rule? —  ( · ) 03:56, 4 November 2008 (UTC)

I will start adding notices to your userspace now. However, I need you to make one edit. At the mentoring plan (now located at , there is now a section marked Aprroval. Please read that section and say that you agree to that. -- 04:20, 4 November 2008 (UTC)

Could an admin correct these minor capitalization errors at the beginning of the group's name.

These are just minor changes, The English Wikipedia capitalizes these groups too. Thanks. 03:03, 29 October 2008 (UTC)

While I do not spend much time reverting vandalism in comparison with creating articles, I know that rollback will be useful when I do notice vandalism at New changes. Could an administrator please enable it on my account? Thanks in advance, () 00:40, 30 October 2008 (UTC)

Is it possible for me to have rollback? I did some reverting on the English Wikipedia. I would happily patrol this Wikipedia. Rollback would make reverting much easier.
Thanks!
I would like to have the rollback flag added please. I Understand what vandalism is and when to revert it. Hopefully my resent Reverts prove this. Thanks () 15:46, 8 December 2008 (UTC)

Tholly brings up a point about need for rollback. There probably should be some basic criteria needed for granting rollback. This does not need to be (and should not be) very strict, say "2-3 weeks active, 50 edits minimum, did some vandalism removal, prior experience a plus". We should at least have some idea they would use it before we give it to them. Basically, check the contributions for the account: does the "next 50" link show up? got some summaries that say you reverted vandalism? Good to go on criteria! -- 19:15, 3 November 2008 (UTC)
Maybe we need ? -- 04:03, 4 December 2008 (UTC)

Outstanding request . Thanks! 15:25, 1 November 2008 (UTC)

I just had a chat regarding , that did not involve him. I considered it quite rude that it was set up where anyone could attack Ric, and indeed people did, and he had no opportunity to defend himself. This is a violation of proper decorum, and basic dignity. The log was here: , before it was censored by Gwib as an "attack page", because he didn't want to show the truth. Why else? —  ( · ) 20:37, 2 November 2008 (UTC)

I did not know it violated Policy, either. I thought that it was OK. Under this rule, should be banned for posting those IRC logs, unless Upperclassman and SwirlBoy gave permission to do so. And no, I haven't been banned from "the channel", as far as I know of. I have been banned from #wikipedia-en and #wikipedia. That log was from #wikipedia-simple. Unless someone banned me in the past 35 minutes, which surely is possible, I haven't been banned from there yet. 

Plus, regardless of policy, I felt I had a moral obligation to publish that, as it was an attack on someone who was not even present. Apparently though, ethics is second to policy on Freenode. —  ( · ) 20:57, 2 November 2008 (UTC)


OK. Jonas has now approved Mentoring. Please be aware he is not do to the following:


If he does, he is to be blocked for 48 hours on sight, and it logged at his Mentoring subpage. Mentors are Gwib, Sharkpedos10 (backup) and Myself. -- 04:41, 4 November 2008 (UTC)


I have unblocked, as it was a good faith block, but a bad mentoring plan. The block was designed to be punitive and not preventative. We should hold a community discussion for mentoring, where we agree on a desired result in accordance with his history. 00:01, 5 November 2008 (UTC)



Fine. In consensus with community consensus, I relinquish my power as mentor. -- 02:40, 6 November 2008 (UTC)

Ok, i debated for ages as to whether or not to bring this here, and I decided I was going to.

Synergy has blocked GoblinBot with little need. It has been approved by Creol imo, but Synergy claims that it is not approved as it does not have a flag.

This came because I complained about as it was flooding RecentChanges several times throughout today, and had clearly exceeded it's 50 edit test.

Synergy claimed that any bot without the flag was not approved, and so blocked mine as well as Techman's.

I feel this is inappropriate as I had already told him and PeterSymonds on IRC when the concern was raised that I would not edit further with it until clarification or a flag was given.

We need some policy on Bots urgently.

Thanks,

Once a few more people show up and discuss this, we can come to a decision as to whether "unflagged" bots can edit, or if we will allow them to edit without a flag. In my opinion (as you already know), I don't think we should. And to us them for editing after a crat has not approved them is grounds for blocking. 18:25, 4 November 2008 (UTC)

Hello, recently declined the unblock request for as he could not find any block for that IP address. I would like to inform the community that Creol blocked 78.145.0.0/16 as Benniguy's range. This is quite a broad range, and it is quite probable that this is not Benniguy. Could someone please block that range with Account Creation enabled, so the user can create an account? 05:05, 5 November 2008 (UTC)

Hello, would it be possible to create a gadget to hide the donations notice? They've done this on the English Wikipedia and I think it's a good idea.

A user (the only user) on 200.88.80.0/20 has been randomly creating fake articles about movies and television series featuring teen actors (and usually herself and friends/family) as well as adding false information to various articles (mainly the links to the fake movies). This has been going on for about two months now. 40+ IP addresses have been used to date from the range to continue the trend. They tend to get in, edit, and get out at or before being given a final warning, so only one of the IPs have a block history. Given the amount of vandalism, the duration of their activity, te lack of good edits and the number of IPs involved, I blocked the range for one month. -- 18:49, 27 December 2008 (UTC)

Template:Inuse/doc

The Inuse is placed at the top of a page you are actively editing for a short period of time. The tag is intended to inform people that someone is currently working on the article, thereby reducing edit conflicts. Please do not leave it in place for more than the few hours at most that should be necessary, as doing so may unnecessarily discourage others from contributing to the article. If it has been up for more than two hours since the last edit, it should be removed. Specifying periods of several days or longer for this template goes against the spirit of simply avoiding edit conflicts; please only use it for sessions where you are actively editing the article.

To use, just add codice_1 at the top of the article you want to work on. If you want to reserve it for a specific length of time and optionally, a message, use codice_1. If you want to reserve it until a certain time, or use a different custom message without the word "for," use codice_1 or codice_1.

The origin of Iniki is unclear, but it possibly began as a tropical wave that shocked the African coast on August 18. It moved westward across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and crossed Central America into the Pacific on the 28th. the shock wave continued to go west, and remained disorganized. Conditions slowly became more favorable, and, as the convection concentrated around a center, the wave was classified Tropical Depression Eighteen-E on September 5, located 1700 miles (2700 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico or 1550 miles (2500 km) east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. The depression continued quickly westward and remained weak until the 8th, when it slowed enough to strengthen to a tropical storm.
Iniki continued to get stronger and became a hurricane on September 9. It turned north towards Hawaii and became major Hurricane the next day. On September 11, -- () 20:30, 30 November 2011 (UTC)Iniki peaked as Category 4 hurricane and hit Hawaii with wind of 145 mph. inki rapidly weakened ande went extra tropical Midway between Also and Hawaii.

The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the hurricane well in advance. For several days prior to the disaster, the CPHC and the news media forecast Iniki to remain well south of the island chain, with the only effect being some high surf conditions. Some of the standard international computer models were indicating a northward turn towards the populated Hawaiian Islands, but these were rejected by the CPHC forecasters. CHPC Advisory #19 was issued at 11 AM local time on September 10, and suggested that a weakening Iniki would remain well to the south. It was not until a special bulletin was issued by the CPHC at 6:30 PM on September 10 - less than 24 hours before landfall - that any warning was given to the public. 

A hurricane watch was issued for Kauai early on September 11 and was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Prior to Iniki's arrival in Kauai, 8,000 people were housed in shelters, most of whom remembered Hurricane Iwa 10 years prior. Rather than sending tourists to public shelters, two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during the storm's passage. During the evacuation of the island, people left days before to family, friends or shelters. Because schools were cancelled, traffic was light and evacuation was well-executed.

The CPHC issued a tropical storm warning for Oahu on September 11 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Though not hit by the hurricane, Iniki's large wind field caused nearly 30,000 people to evacuate to 110 public shelters in Oahu. Public school buildings acted as shelters, and were for refuge only, meaning they did not provide food, cots, blankets, medications or other comfort items. Roughly one-third of Oahu's population participated in the evacuation, though many others went to the house of a family member or friend for shelter. The execution of the evacuations went well, beginning with the vulnerable coastal area. For those in need, vans and buses gave emergency transportation, while police manned certain overused intersections. The two main problems that occurred during the evacuation were lack of parking at shelters and exit routes for the coastlines.

Hurricane Iniki was the costliest hurricane to strike the state of Hawaii, causing $1.8 billion ($2.6 billion in 2004 US dollars) in damage. Most damage was on the island of Kauai, where the storm destroyed thousands of homes and left a large amount of the island without power, although Oahu also suffered significant damage. Iniki also was responsible for 6 deaths.

The hurricane nearly struck the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu. Had it hit there, Iniki, along with Hurricane Andrew and Typhoon Omar, would have struck each of the three National Weather Service offices responsible for tropical cyclone warnings within a two-month period.

Analog-to-digital converter

An analog-to-digital converter (abbreviated ADC, A/D or A to D) is an electronic integrated circuit that converts a continuous quantity to a discrete time digital number. An ADC may also provide an isolated measurement. The reverse operation is performed by a digital-to-analog converter (DAC).

Typically, an ADC is an electronic device that converts an input analog voltage or current to a digital number. The size of the number grows with an increase in the input voltage or current. However, some non-electronic or only partially electronic devices, such as rotary encoders, can also be considered ADCs.

Spider-Man 2

Spider-Man 2 is a 2004 movie and the sequel to the 2002 "Spider-Man" movie. All of the main cast came back to make the movie.

Peter Parker starts to think that his role as Spider-Man is distracting him from his real life. He once delivers pizzas and is late because he had to save two children from being run over in the street. 

Soon, Peter was invited to attend a demonstration by a man named Otto Octavius. He has built a series of four mechanical arms. He says that the arms can control him, but because of a special mental chip on his back, he can control them instead of the other way around. He uses the arms to allow him to build and touch a reactor that uses energy from the sun. The reactor is powered by tritium. Tritium is very rare and costly, so Harry Osborn and his company spend their money to provide him with the product. However, a paper clip gets into the machine and causes massive damage. Otto's wife is killed. Peter dons the Spider-Man costume and rescues his friend Harry Osborn. Harry is mad because he hates Spider-Man since he thinks that Spider-Man killed his father (back in the first movie). The accident causes Otto's mechanical arms to fuse to his body, and it also destroyed the chip that allows him to control his arms. The loss of his wife makes him go crazy. The arms start forcing him to build the machine again to get revenge, but say they needed money in order to do it. Now called Doc Ock by the press, Otto attempts to rob a bank vault for cash, but is foiled by Spider-Man in the process.

Later, Peter promises to attend Mary Jane Watson's play, but is distracted by a crime in progress and has to go fight it and arrest the criminal. He cannot go into the play afterwards and Mary Jane likes him less for missing the play. He finally decides to give up the Spider-Man costume and become a normal person.

Without Spider-Man in his life, Peter's grades improve in school. He attends Mary Jane's play. However, she tells him that she has already been engaged to John Jameson. John is the son of his boss at the Daily Beagle.

Doc Ock later, after finishing the machine, wants some more tritium to power it.. He wants to build rebuild his reactor to be even larger than before. He forces Harry to give it to him by threatening to kill him. Harry says he will give him the tritium as long as he brings Spider-Man to him. Doc Ock kidnaps Mary Jane, forcing Peter to put his suit again. A fight breaks out. Finally, Doc Ock puts a subway on course to crash. Spider-Man manages to stop the train with great effort. but becomes very weak and is captured and tied up and brought to Harry. Harry takes out a knife to kill him, but is shocked and stopped when he pulls off Spider-Man's mask to reveal that his friend Peter is underneath the mask. Peter forces Harry to tell him where Doc Ock is, and then goes down there to save Mary Jane and the city.

Down at the river, Doc Ock has rebuilt his reactor, this one much larger than before. Peter stuns him with an electric shock, reveals who he is, and convinces him to not do it, and Doc Ock has a change of heart. He says that the reactor is so big that only a river can contain it and uses his mechanical arms to destroy the floor underneath and dies in the process. Peter reveals his secret identity to Mary Jane but says they cannot be together because Spider-Man's enemies will target her.

At the end of the movie, Peter sits in his apartment and is very unhappy. The wedding for Mary Jane Watson is about to take place, but at the last minute she cancels and runs to the apartment. There, she tells him that she is willing to take the risk of being Spider-Man's girlfriend. A fire truck siren roars past. She says, "Go get them, tiger" and watches as Spider-Man goes out on another rescue mission.

Pasties

Pasties (sing. 'pastie') are small pieces of cloth, plastic or metal. They are treated specially so they are sticky. They are used to cover a girl's nipples or genital area. They vary in size and are usually not much larger than the person's areola.

The concept of 'pasties' is to show as much of the breast as possible without making the woman entirely topless. Many exotic dancers in strip clubs are required to wear them by law. Pasties are usually applied with a special glue or tape. This is the origin of their name, as they are quite literally 'pasted' onto the nipple.

Pasties are worn by many neo-burlesque performers. Burlesque pasties may also feature tassels which hang from the center, performer will sometimes twirl these as part of a performance. 

Some women who choose not to wear a bra wear pasties to prevent their nipples from protruding visibly through their shirt. 

The United States Supreme Court held in "Erie v. Pap's A.M." that a city ordinance requiring erotic dancers to wear pasties, and a g-string, was constitutional.

Prairie dog

Prairie dogs are a type of mammal, but they are not dogs. They are small, burrowing rodents – a type of ground squirrel. They live in short-grass prairies and mountain plains of the western USA and Mexico. The explorers Lewis and Clark sent a prairie dog to President Thomas Jefferson during their expedition; it was quite strange to them.

Prairie dogs are found in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. In Mexico, they are mostly found in the northern states, which are the southern end of the great plains: northeastern Sonora, north and northeastern Chihuahua, northern Coahuila, northern Nuevo León, and northern Tamaulipas; in the U.S., they range primarily west of the Mississippi River, though they have also been introduced in a few eastern locales. They will eat all sorts of vegetables and fruits.

Prairie dogs are mostly herbivores (plant-eaters). They eat grasses, seeds, leaves, flowers, fruit, eggs, and some insects.

Highly social, prairie dogs live in large colonies – collections of prairie dog families that can span hundreds of acres. Families usually are made up of one male and two to four females living in a strict social hierarchy. Prairie dog pups reach sexual maturity at about 3 years of age, and after their third winter the dominant male in a given family will drive them away, forcing them to establish their own families on the edges of the colony. The dominant male will defend the family's borders against rival prairie dogs, and disputes are resolved by fighting. Prairie dogs are also aggressive against predators such as badgers and snakes. 

Prairie dogs are social animals, and often make social visits with each other, and greet each other with a sort of kiss. Prairie dogs employ a complex form of communication that involves barks and rhythmic chirps.

Prairie dog tunnel systems usually have several rooms. Tunnels can go down as far as , and can extend laterally as much as . Prairie dogs line their burrows with grass to insulate them, and the earth excavated from the burrow is piled up in mounds around the burrow's entrance. The prairie dogs use these carefully maintained mounds as observation posts.

The prairie dog is well adapted to predators. They can detect predators from a far distance and alert other prairie dogs to the danger with a special, high-pitched call. Prairie dogs use different calls to identify specific predators. Prairie dogs also trim the vegetation around their colonies, perhaps to remove any cover for predators. Their burrows generally contain several routes of escape.

The prairie dog is chiefly herbivorous, though it eats some insects. It feeds primarily on grasses and, in the fall, broadleaf plants. Prairie dogs have 1-6 pups (babies) yearly, which are born blind and furless and need about 30 days of close nurturing from their mother.

Sometimes two prairie dogs touch teeth with each other. Researchers think they do this as a way of recognizing each other.

Prairie dogs are hunted by many animals, including wolves, dogs, coyotes, bobcats, foxes, and humans.

Pierre-Auguste Renoir

Pierre-Auguste Renoir (25 February 1841–3 December 1919) was a French artist. He was a leading painter who helped to create the Impressionist style. He painted portraits, and still life, but above all, he painted social scenes of the day. 

As a painter of women, especially feminine sensuality, it has been said that "Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau".

Pierre-Auguste Renoir was born in Limoges, Haute-Vienne, France, the child of a working class family. As a boy, he worked in a porcelain factory where his drawing talents led to him being chosen to paint designs on fine china. He also painted hangings for overseas missionaries and decorations on fans before he enrolled in art school. During those early years, he often visited the Louvre to study the French master painters.

In the late 1860s, through the practice of painting light and water "en plein air" (in the open air), he and his friend Claude Monet discovered that the color of shadows is not brown or black, but the reflected color of the objects surrounding them, an effect today known as diffuse reflection. Several pairs of paintings exist in which Renoir and Monet, working side-by-side, depicted the same scenes ("La Grenouillère", 1869). 

Renoir experienced his initial acclaim when six of his paintings hung in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. In the same year, two of his works were shown with Paul Durand-Ruel in London.

One of the best known Impressionist works is Renoir's 1876 Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette ("Bal du moulin de la Galette"). The painting depicts an open-air scene, crowded with people, at a popular dance garden on the "Butte Montmartre", close to where he lived.

The works of his early maturity were typically Impressionist snapshots of real life, full of sparkling colour and light.

A trip to Italy in 1881, when he saw works by Raphael and other Renaissance masters, that convinced him that he was on the wrong path. For the next several years he painted in a more severe, classical, style. After 1890, however, he changed direction again, returning to thinly brushed colour to dissolve outlines as in his earlier work. From this period onward he concentrated on nudes and domestic scenes.

A prolific artist, he made several thousand paintings. The warm sensuality of Renoir's style made his paintings some of the most well-known and reproduced works in the history of art. The single largest collection of his works—181 paintings in all—is at the Barnes Foundation, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 

In 1890, he married Aline Victorine Charigot. She, with a number of the artist's friends, had been a model for "Le Déjeuner des canotiers" (Luncheon of the Boating Party, 1881). They already had a child, Pierre, in 1885. After his marriage, Renoir painted many scenes of his wife and daily family life, including their children and their nurse, Aline's cousin. The Renoirs had three sons, one of whom, Jean, became a film director of note and another, Pierre, became a stage and film actor.

Around 1892, Renoir developed rheumatoid arthritis. In 1907, he moved to the warmer climate of "Les Collettes," a farm at Cagnes-sur-Mer, close to the Mediterranean coast. Renoir painted during the last twenty years of his life, even when arthritis severely limited his movement, and he was wheelchair-bound. He developed progressive deformities in his hands and ankylosis of his right shoulder, requiring him to adapt his painting technique. It has often been reported that in the advanced stages of his arthritis, he painted by having a brush strapped to his paralyzed fingers, but this is erroneous; Renoir remained able to grasp a brush, although he required an assistant to place it in his hand. The wrapping of his hands with bandages, apparent in late photographs of the artist, served to prevent skin irritation.

During this period, he created sculptures by cooperating with a young artist, Richard Guino, who worked the clay. Renoir also used a moving canvas, or picture roll, to help him paint large works.

In 1919, Renoir visited the Louvre to see his paintings hanging with the old masters. He died in the village of Cagnes-sur-Mer, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, on December 3.

Antoine Watteau

Jean-Antoine Watteau (October 10, 1684 – July 18, 1721) was a French painter whose brief career spurred the revival of interest in colour and movement (in the tradition of Correggio and Rubens), and brought back the almost forgotten Baroque idiom, which, in time became known as Rococo. He is credited with inventing the genre of "fêtes galantes": scenes of bucolic and idyllic charm, along with an air of theatricality. Some of his best known subjects were drawn from the world of Italian comedy and ballet.

Soggy biscuit

Soggy biscuit (also called limp biscuit, or ookie cookie) is a masturbation game played mostly by teenage groups in which the participants stand around a biscuit masturbating until ejaculating onto it; the last person to do so must eat the biscuit. The term is thought to have originated in Australia sometime in the 1960s.

Although the way its spelled may differ slightly, the notability of the game is shown by the variations on the being referred to in popular culture, examples including Stephen Fry's "The Liar", the German movie "Crazy" and Skinless's song "Scum Cookie".

Hurricane Isabel

Hurricane Isabel was the costliest and deadliest hurricane in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season. Isabel formed from a tropical wave in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165 mph (265 km/h) on September 11. After weakening and strengthening for four days, Isabel slowly weakened. It moved onto the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land.

In North Carolina, the storm surge from Isabel washed away part of Hatteras Island. This area of washed away land was sometimes known as Isabel Inlet. Damage was highest along the Outer Banks, where thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed. The worst effects happened in Virginia, especially in the Hampton Roads area and on the shores of the James River. Virginia had the most deaths and damage from the hurricane. About 64% of the total damage and 68% of the total deaths from the storm happened in North Carolina and Virginia.

There was moderate to severe damage up the Atlantic coastline and as far west as West Virginia. About six million lost power in the eastern United States. Rain fell from South Carolina to Maine, and westward to Michigan. In total, damage is estimated at $3.6 billion (2003 USD, $4.1 billion 2008 USD). 16 deaths in seven states are blamed directly on the hurricane. 35 more deaths in six states and one province were not directly related to the hurricane.

Eugène Delacroix

Ferdinand Victor Eugène Delacroix (26 April 1798 – 13 August 1863) was a French Romantic artist regarded from the outset of his career as the leader of the French Romantic school. Delacroix's use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement. A fine lithographer, Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott, and the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. 

In contrast to the Neoclassical perfectionism of his chief rival Ingres, Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of Rubens and painters of the Venetian Renaissance, with an attendant emphasis on color and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modeled form. Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity, and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art, but to travel in North Africa, in search of the exotic. Friend and spiritual heir to Théodore Géricault, Delacroix was also inspired by Byron, with whom he shared a strong identification with the "forces of the sublime", of nature in often violent action.

However, Delacroix was given neither to sentimentality nor bombast, and his Romanticism was that of an individualist. In the words of Baudelaire, "Delacroix was passionately in love with passion, but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible."

Delacroix was a member of the Club des Hashischins, or Hashish Club. This group of French writers experimented with hashish to get ideas.

Period (punctuation)

A period, also known as a full stop, in punctuation is a dot (.) that is at the end of a sentence. It shows that an idea has finished.

When it is used in numbers, it is called a decimal point. It shows that the numbers to the right of it are less than one, as in "1.234". When it is used to write money in numbers, it shows that the numbers to the right of it are less than one pound/dollar/euro. For example:

means that Elizabeth paid one dollar and twenty-five cents for her drink.

A period also means a word has been shortened when it is after the word, for example: "Pty. Ltd." The words doctor, mister, and mistress are often made shorter when used with a name. ""Dr." Smith" is the name of a doctor whose last name is Smith, and ""Mr." Banerjee" and ""Mrs." Yang" are common ways of writing "Mister Banerjee" and "Mistress Yang". It is also used for names when the first and middle name are shortened but the last name is not, for example ""J." Citizen".

When three periods are used together (...), they are called an ellipsis.

At first, there was supposed to be only one winner; that person was Selina Ren. But then the record label thought that the other two girls, Hebe Tien and Ella Chen, were good singers too, so they put the three girls together. Since the release of "Girls Dorm", S.H.E's first album, in 2001, the group has released a total of 11 albums, and sold over 4.5 million copies. However, some people do not like S.H.E because they often sing songs that other people had sung before. In addition to music, the trio has acted in many TV dramas, and sang many theme songs for them. Because of S.H.E's success, some Taiwanese companies are now trying to create girl groups of their own.

Multiplexer

In electronics, a multiplexer or mux ("occasionally the term mul-dex is also found, for a combination multiplexer-demultiplexer") is a device that selects one of many analog or digital input signals and outputs it into a single output line. This process is termed: multiplexing.

An electronic multiplexer makes it possible for several signals to share one expensive device or other resource, for example one A/D converter or one communication line, instead of having one device per input signal. 

An analog multiplexer is a special type of analog switch that connects one signal selected from several inputs to a single output.

A digital multiplexer is a set of parallel switches, with selector that selects one of the input digital channels to outputs into the single digital output channel. The selector selects one of the input channels according to the digital command (number) it receives.

In electronics, a demultiplexer (or demux) is a device taking a single input signal and selecting one of many data-output-lines, which is connected to the single input. A multiplexer is often used with a complementary demultiplexer on the receiving end. 

An electronic multiplexer can be considered as a multiple-input, single-output switch, and a demultiplexer as a single-input, multiple-output switch. 

In telecommunications and signal processing, a multiplexer is a device that combines several input information signals into one output signal, which carries several communication channels, by means of some multiplex technique. A demultiplexer is in this context a device that takes a single input signal that carries many channels and separates the channels over multiple output signals.

One cost-saving use for multiplexers is connecting a multiplexer and a demultiplexer (or demux) together (called mul-dex) over a single communication channel (by connecting the multiplexer's single output to the demultiplexer's single input). The image to the right demonstrates this.

In this case, the cost of implementing separate channels for each data source is more expensive than the cost of implementing the multiplexing/demultiplexing functions.

At the receiving end of the data link a complementary "demultiplexer" is normally required to break single data stream back down into the original streams.

In some cases, the far end system may have more functionality than a simple demultiplexer and so, at the same time as the demultiplexing still exists logically, it may never actually happen physically, such as in network address translation where a number of IP private network users are multiplexed over a single public IP address.

Input/output

In computing, input/output, or I/O, refers to the communication between a digital processing system (such as a computer or an embedded system), and the outside world – possibly a human, another processing system or a device. 

Inputs are the signals or data received by the system, and outputs are the signals or data sent from it. 

I/O devices are used by a person (or other system) to communicate with the digital processing system. For instance, keyboards and mice are considered input devices of a computer, while monitors and printers are considered output devices of a computer. Devices for communication between computers, such as modems and network cards, typically serve for both input and output.

Note that the description of a device as either input or output depends on how it is viewed. Mouses and keyboards take as input physical movement that the human user outputs and convert it into signals that a computer can understand. The output from these devices is input for the computer. Similarly, printers and monitors take as input signals that a computer outputs. They then convert these signals into representations that human users can see or read. (For a human user the process of reading or seeing these representations is receiving input.)

An instruction set is a list of all the instructions with all their variations, that a processor can execute.

Instructions include:

An instruction set, or instruction set architecture (ISA), is the part of the computer architecture related to programming, including the native data types, instructions, registers, addressing modes, memory architecture, interrupt and exception handling, and external I/O. An ISA includes a specification of the set of opcodes (machine language), the native commands implemented by a particular CPU design.

Instruction set architecture is distinguished from the microarchitecture, microarchitecture is the detailed description of the system that is sufficient for completely describing the operation of all parts of the computing system, and how they are inter-connected and inter-operate in order to implement the Instruction set architecture.

Computers with different microarchitectures can share a common instruction set. For example, the Intel Pentium and the AMD Athlon implement nearly identical versions of the x86 instruction set, but they are very different in internal designs.

The energy used by equipment is always more than the energy really needed. This is because no equipment is 100% efficient. Power is wasted as heat, vibrations and/or electromagnetic radiation.

Power consumption is usually measured in units of kilowatt hours (kWh).

More accurately, power is the rate of consumption of energy, measured in watts or horsepower.

Very long instruction word

Very Long Instruction Word or VLIW which refers to a CPU architecture designed to take advantage of instruction level parallelism (ILP) but at minimum level of hardware complexities. ( Alternatively, Variable Length Instruction Word or VLIW a refers to a CPU instruction ( instruction set ) designed to load ( or copy ) a literal value count of inline Machine code to the on-chip RAM for higher speed CPU decoding. )

A processor that executes every instruction one after the other (i.e. a non-pipelined scalar architecture) may use processor resources inefficiently, leading to poor performance. 
The performance can be improved by using micro-architectural design techniques that use ILP including:

All above ILP techniques are implemented at a higher cost with increased hardware complexity. Before executing any operations in-parallel, the processor must verify that the instructions do not have interdependencies. There are many types of interdependencies, but a simple example would be a program in which the first instruction's result is used as an input for the second instruction. They clearly cannot execute at the same time, and the second instruction cannot be executed before the first. Modern out-of-order processors use major resources in order to take advantage of these techniques, since the scheduling of instructions must be determined dynamically as a program executes based on dependencies.

The VLIW approach, on the other hand, executes operation in parallel based on a fixed schedule determined when programs are compiled. Since determining the order of execution of operations (including which operations can execute simultaneously) is handled by the compiler, the processor does not need the complex hardware required by ILP techniques described above. As a result, VLIW CPUs offer significant computational power with less hardware complexity but with greater compiler design complexity.

The VLIW approach is a concept which is only useful as the code generated by a compiler makes it, but with a number of special-purpose instructions available to simplify certain complicated operations:

Governor Phraya Ratsadanupradit Mahison Phakdi brought rubber from Malaysia and planted it here before anywhere else in southern Thailand in 1899. Rubber is now consider an important product of Thailand. The important rivers that flow through the province, are the Trang River and Palian River. The rivers flow between the Khao Luang the Banthat mountain ranges. The province has an area about 5,000 square km. It is located on the Andaman Sea, and contains 46 islands together with the mainland area. Most of the area is hills. Trang is a good place in the south to travel. The best time for sea travel is during October to May because at other times it is raining. When the rains come, there are also storms.

Goatse.cx

Goatse.cx (pronounced either ) was an Internet shock site. The page featured a picture, hello.jpg, showing an undressed man stretching his butt to a large size with both hands, with the inside of his rectum clearly visible. Below his gaping anus, his dangling penis and scrotum were visible, as well as a ring on the ring finger of his left hand.

The image hello.jpg comes from a set of forty pictures from a file named gap.zip. In those images, the man used sex toys and butt plugs to stretch his anus. The images were located by "Stile Project" and are also available from the "Contrib" section of the goatse.cx website under the filename gap.zip. hello.jpg is the third file in the archive, gap3.jpg.

On January 14, 2004, the domain "goatse.cx" was closed for a time. by Christmas Island Internet Administration for policy violations in response to a complaint, but many mirrors of the site are still available, and the picture is displayed on many websites.

In January 2007, Christmas Island Internet Administration put the domain goatse.cx back into the pool of available domains. The domain was then registered on January 16 through domain registrar Variomedia, and the current holder tried to auction off the right to use the domain.

The goatse.cx domain name was reported sold at an auction on April 30, 2007 to an unknown bidder. According to seobidding.com, the first auction ended with fake bids so the auction was reactivated. This was again won by fake bidders, so Seobidding.com announced that the website would be sold for $500,000 and that legal action would be pursued against the fake bidders. On November 25, 2007, the site was for sale on seobidding; "goatse.cx asking: $50200 minimum."

Control of the domain was moved to the another market, and was taken by domain squatters who were trying to sell the domain name for 10,000 euros.

On July 4, 2008, the site was open again, with a picture of Bill O'Reilly and a legal notice. The file name and text remained the same as before.

As of September 28, 2008, the site was again put up for sale, and the picture changed once again because of a legal order from Fox Broadcasting Company ordering the owner to stop showing a picture of Bill O'Reilly.

The site used the .cx country code, the top-level domain of the Australian territory of Christmas Island. The actual computer server of Goatse.cx was not on Christmas Island, but in the United States and was owned by Hick.org, a website about computer programming and bathroom humor. The Hick.org domain was registered by Matt Miller in Overland Park, Kansas. Both Goatse.cx and Hick.org originated from the same IP address; the server was in Kansas City, Missouri, metro-region. Goat.cx, formerly a mirror of Goatse.cx, was in the Dallas, Texas, metro-region, while current mirror Goatse.ru is in Russia.

Many Internet users have been tricked into looking at the site at one time or another, it has become something of an Internet meme. As such, hello.jpg and the other images on the site are common subjects of parodies and tributes.

After Hurricane Charley in August 2004, an image purporting to show "the hands of God" in the cloud formations in the aftermath of the disaster circulated in email. The image was proven to be a false Goatse parody.

In June 2007, a parody of the 2012 Summer Olympics logo sent by "Sean Stayte" appeared on the BBC News website under the alternative Olympic Logo entries and was broadcast on their BBC News 24 channel. Two hands were pulling the 0 from 2012 apart. The image was later shown as part of a gallery of viewers logos on BBC London News and BBC News 24, and was subsequently removed from the website. The editor of the BBC News website stated the mistake in his blog, saying his team "simply didn’t spot it".

Modesty

Modesty (also called demureness or reticence) is the name for a number of norms of behaviour a society expects form the individual people that make up this society.

Modesty usually includes:

Different fashions test the level of modesty. People are usually also subjected to peer pressure.

Different levels of modesty apply in different situations, and to different groups of people.

Modesty is a social norm, it does not apply when it cannot, such as in an emergency. In the case of an emergency it is more important that doctors treat those that are wounded. It does not matter that doctors may see those people naked. In some cases, it may be necessary that they take off all the clothes, to be able to treat them better.

Some people still insist on maintaining their standards of modesty, even in an emergency situation.

Modesty usually says that the parts of the human body that do not need to be exposed should not be. Usually, this applies to bare skin, hair, undergarments, and especially to intimate parts. Sometimes, the standards do not only say that the respective part should be hidden, but also that special clothing should hide its shape, what it looks like. Certain standards say how the changing of clothes should be done, like using a towel on a beach or closing (and locking) a door of a cabin that is provided.

Different cultures have different standards of modesty. But standards are also different according to who the other people are, that could possibly see one's body:


Social standing or class can also matter. That way, different rules can apply to people of the same social class than to those of other (or lower) social classes. 

Other things that influence these norms include:


That way, a teacher that would perform at a night club might be seen as "bringing the profession into disresapect". Some people say this kind of modesty is "body shame".

Too much modesty is called prudishness. As a medical condition it is also called gymnophobia. Excessive "immodesty" is called exhibitionism. Proponents of modesty often see it as respect for their bodies and the feelings of themselves and others, and some people believe it may reduce sexual crimes. Critics argue that it's not healthy to have a negative attitude toward the human body. Some assert that there may be a correlation between repressive body attitudes and undesirable outcomes such as sexual crimes, violence, and stress.

The cultural and religious background heavily influence the views a person has on modesty. 

What is called Western culture expects that Intimate body parts are covered in public places at all times. There are exceptions for places where people change clothes, as these are usually differentiated by sex. This means there is one changing-room for men, and another for women. Other exceptions include saunas, which tend to be mixed-sex (there is one sauna for both men and women) places. 

Special rules also apply for places where bathing is common. It might be tolerated that a woman is topless on a beach, or near a pool. If there is a restaurant near the beach or pool, it is usual, that the woman can be topless on the beach, but if she wants to eat something in the restaurant, that she has to cover her breasts. Very often, such restaurants are visually segregated by a railing. On one side of the railing there is the beach, on the other, there is the restaurant.

There are more and more beaches in cities. This blurs the boundary even more. There may be people in swimsuits next to businesspeople in a suit. 

In private homes, the rules may be more relaxed. Nudity among close family members in the home is sometimes permitted, especially in the bedroom and bathroom. Wearing undergarments casually may be permitted as well. Elsewhere in the home, family members may be expected to wear more clothes, casually, especially if guests are present. A bathrobe may fulfill the purpose here.

Naturists have different views. They want to create an environment, were people can feel at ease, even when they are nude, they can be seen nude, or nude people are among them. These values conflict with the current standards of modesty. For this reason, nudists mostly reject the current standards of modesty.

Traditional indigenous cultures such as those in Africa, or the aborigines in Australia have social norms that vary greatly. How much exposure is acceptable varies from nothing for some women, to everything except the glans penis for some men of certain tribes. Certain African cultures think body painting is body coverage. Many think it is an "attire".

There are different standards of modesty for men and women. Western culture expects that both men and women keep their genitals covered. It also expects that women keep their breasts covered, most of the time. There may be exceptions for bathing, or breastfeeding.

Showing naked soldiers bathing became common during the Second World War. Boys in high-school age also swam in the nude, during that time. 

Fashion as well as other social norms expect that men cover more body parts than women, such as the midriff and the upper part of the back.

Swimming pants are often larger for men than for women. Before the 1930s, men were generally prohibited from baring their chests in public, even at beaches. Organizations such as the Topfree Equal Rights Association advocate for gender equality in this regard. In 1992, New York State's highest court accepted 14th Amendment arguments and struck down the provision in New York's "Exposure of the Person" statute that made it illegal for women to bare their chests where men were permitted to do so. 

Sexual orientation is a subject that is less and less a taboo. Homosexuality also seems to be more common or more talked about. This has led to stricter levels of modesty in same-sex situations, such as in changing-rooms. In several places, community showers have been converted to single showers, with curtains or doors. Many students no longer shower after exercise. Research has shown a dramatic decline in same-sex sexual activity among adolescent males that correlates with the increasing social visibility of gays and the increasing level of modesty. Related factors are the increasing emphasis on ideal male physiques shown by advertisements and the concern over being photographed and videotaped.

Islamic society thinks modesty is important, but there are different interpretations of what dress should be considered modest. Many Muslim women wear a headscarf (hijab) as a sign of modesty. More conservative societies expect that women cover their whole body, except for their hands and their face. 

A woman who choses to also cover her face and hands is said to be expressing greater "modesty and holiness". In some Islamic societies, women wear the niqab, an all-encompassing garment intended to conceal every part of the body, sometimes including the eyes. Wearing a niqab (sometimes referred to as a burqa, although this term only technically applies to an Afghan all-in-one garment) is common in some countries with a majority Muslim population. 

In most Muslim countries a woman can chose how to express her modesty. More conservative countries such as Afghanistan or Iran do have laws that say what kind of dress a woman should wear. Not obeying these laws can lead to harsh punishments. 
Likewise, according to some Islamic interpretations of Hadith, men are required to cover everything from 'navel to knee'; with some men choosing to extend this to the traditional Islamic head covering taqiyah (cap), the male counterpart to hijab which closely resembles the Jewish yarmulke but is slightly larger in size. The taqiyah cap may vary in shape, size or color just as the hijab does, with many regional differences according to tradition and personal taste.

A burqini is a swimsuit designed for Muslim women that covers the whole body except the face, the hands and the feet, that enables them to satisfy the requirements of Muslim standards of modesty while enabling them to take part in swimming activities.

Modesty is also important in Judaism, especially in the case of women. An orthodox married woman is expected by their community to cover her hair in public, and sometimes at home. The hair covering may be a scarf, hat, snood, or a wig ("sheitel"). Some communities have stricter standards and expect women to cover their elbows and legs, with blouses covering the collarbone and sleeves covering elbows. Skirts are expected to cover the knees. All slits in skirts are expected to be closed. See-through materials may not be used and clothes are expected not to be tight-fitting, provocative, loud in color, or display texts. Some communities apply these standards to girls as young as three.

Non-orthodox Jewish women tend to adopt the fashions of the non-Jewish society in which they live.

Catholics are expected to dress modestly, but there are no "official guidelines". Form time to time, priests and popes have given their opinion. These opinions are not binding, nevertheless many Catholics find them useful. 

Pope Pius XII stated that women should cover their upper arms and shoulders, that their skirts should cover at least as far as the knee, and the neckline should not reveal anything. Another example is Giuseppe Cardinal Siri of Genoa, who stated that trousers were unacceptable dress for women. Many tradition-minded Catholics have attempted to further expand on this latter standard.

Some Catholics have attempted to make theories of modesty. Sometimes this is from a sociological perspective, while at other times it takes a more systematic, Thomistic approach, combined with the writings of the Church Fathers. Approaches arguing primarily from traditional practices and traditional authorities, such as the saints, can also be found.

The Church also expects men to dress modestly, but the demands are not as strict for them as for women; this is largely because men are often thought to be more inherently susceptible to sexual thoughts.

These dogs are small in stature but wide and compact with thick, massive heads. The muzzle is short and pug. The coat comes in many colors, including fawn, white, black & brindle. Black is undesirable in the show ring but not a disqualification and is recognized by the AKC.The dog's nose is made for it to bite a bull's nose and not let go. Because the stocky legs are set squarely at each corner of the compact, muscular body, the Bulldog's deliberate gate has become a waddle. They are good family dogs, known for their courage and their excellent guarding abilities. A lot of human attention is needed for Bulldog happiness. These dogs need little exercise or grooming except for the face which should be wiped daily in the face folds with a damp cloth. They weigh 53 to 55 lbs. and stand 12-16" at the shoulders.

The sword, symbolizes the importance of the inscription by underlining it.

Green flags with this or other Arabic scripts are commonly seen in Islam. They should not be confused with the Saudi national flag. These other flags normally do not have the sword symbol. 

The flag is made so that the "shahada" reads correctly, from right to left, from either side. The sword points from hoist to fly on both sides. The flag is sinister hoisted. This means that the obverse side (front) has the hoist side (flagpole side) to the right.

<doc id="140697" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140697" title="Child pornography">
Child pornography

Child pornography is material showing children in erotic poses or having sex. It is usually graphic material in the form of drawings, photographs or video, but can be in writing as well. Child pornography that involves real children is a record of child sexual abuse.

Usually, these children are shown or described as being in different stages of undress, with some clothes off, or completely naked.

Child sexual abuse happens in different ways in the making of child pornography, with the most critical way being the actual molestation. Another way is that, when the act is captured with a camera it makes the abuse worse for the child,
just knowing that the event is being recorded for possible future abuse – including extortion (blackmailing) and sharing, out of the victim's control. Linked to that is many of the reasons to why that recording is then – in itself – seen as abuse. One important part of those reasons, is that the recording makes the abuse possible to go on even longer than the direct damage upon the child,
and with the Internet it may very well be seen as permanent. This makes the impact on the child even larger, not knowing – but surely worrying about – how the images might be used.

In both common usage and for the purpose of research (looking up information), the word "child" in the phrase "child pornography" refers to children before they reach puberty, and does not refer to post-puberty teenagers. For practical reasons, the way the law describes child pornography generally refer to a wider age range, including any pornography involving a minor, according to where the law applies. Most people who own child pornography who are arrested are found to own images of children who have not started puberty; owners of pornographic images of post-puberty minors are less likely to be prosecuted, even though those images also fall within the laws.

Child pornography is a multi-billion dollar industry and among the fastest growing crime activities on the Internet, according to the US The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) and other international sources. According to the NCMEC, almost one fifth of all Internet pornography is child pornography. New technology such as inexpensive digital cameras and sending across the internet, such as file sharing, has made it easier than ever before to produce and pass out child pornography. The people who make child pornography try to avoid prosecution by sending their material across borders with other countries, though this issue is being dealt with more and more with regular arrests of suspects from a number of countries happening over the last few years.

Child pornography is looked at and collected by pedophiles for a number of purposes, ranging from private sexual uses, exchanging with other pedophiles, preparing children for sexual abuse as part of the process known as "grooming", or for bribing victims into making more child pornography or going into child prostitution.

<doc id="140701" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140701" title="Child prostitution">
Child prostitution

Child prostitution is a term for children working as prostitutes. They are children who get paid to have sex. Sometimes, the children do not get paid with money, but they are given other things in exchange for having sex. The meaning of "child prostitute" varies. Many laws say that children are people under 18 years of age. In most cases, it is not the child who makes money from the prostitution, but another person. This is either a pimp, or someone who directly abuses the child. This person will make a deal directly with the child to get sexual gratification. Different people may also exchange children to have sex with. 

The Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (Convention No 182) of the International Labor Organization (ILO) provides that the "use, procuring or offering of a child for prostitution" is one of the "worst forms of child labor". This convention from 1999, provides that countries that have signed it must get rid of child prostitution s soon as possible. It has the fastest pace of ratifications in the ILO's history since 1919.

The prostitution of children is seen as part of the commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), and is sometimes connected to the trafficking of children for sexual purposes, and to child pornography. Child sex tourism also falls within the category of the prostitution of children.
In 1992, researcher and expert Ron O'Grady estimated the number of child prostitutes to be 1 million.

In 2001, Dr. Richard Estes and Dr. Neil Alan Weiner estimated that in the U.S., 162,000 U.S. homeless youth are victims of commercial sexual exploitation (CVE) and that 57,800 children in homes (including public housing) are estimated to be victims of CVE. They also estimated that 30% of shelter youth and 70% of homeless youth are victims of CVE in the United States.

One third of street-level prostitutes in the U.S. are less 18 years old while fifty percent of off-street prostitutes are less than 18 years old. Off-street prostitution includes massage parlors, strip clubs, and escort services. According to Estes and Weiner, 12 to 14 is the average age of entry into prostitution for girls under 17 years old in the United States while the average age of entry into prostitution is between 11 and 13.

In Ukraine, a survey conducted by the group “La Strada-Ukraine” in 2001-2003, based on a sample of 106 women being 'trafficked' out of Ukraine found that 3% were under 18, and the US State Department reported in 2004 that incidents of minors being trafficked was increasing. 

In Thailand, NGOs have estimated that up to a third of prostitutes are children under 18. A study by the International Labor Organization on child prostitution in Vietnam reported that incidence of children in
prostitution is steadily increasing and children under 18 make up between 5 percent and 20 percent of prostitution depending on the geographical area.

In the Philippines, UNICEF estimated that there are 60,000 child prostitutes and many of the 200 brothels in the notorious Angeles City offer children for sex.

ECPAT New Zealand and Stop Demand Foundation have cited in a report “The Nature and Extent of the Sex Industry in New Zealand,” a police survey of the New Zealand sex industry that 210 children under the age of 18 years were identified as selling sex, with three-quarters being concentrated in one Police District.

The 1996 report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography estimates that about one million children in Asia alone are victims of the sex trade. According to the International Labor Organization, the problem is especially alarming in Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia and Nepal.

A 2006 report by World Vision Middle East/Eastern Europe funded by the Canadian government and supported by six United Nations agencies and the International Organization for Migration reported that the sexual exploitation of children, child trafficking and sexual violence towards minors is increasing and that Russia is becoming a new destination for child sex tourism. The report adds that some studies claim approximately 20 to 25 percent of Moscow's sex workers are minors.

In Africa and South Asia, many countries are faced with a rising child prostitution rate and the linkage with tourism is evident. Child prostitution and the trafficking of children for sexual exploitation is also increasing in Europe, North America, Japan and Australia.

In Rio de Janeiro, the City Social Assistance Secretary estimates that there are 223 child prostitutes, both boys and girls. Some are transvestites. The transactions are intermediated by pimps. They charge from 2 reals to 30 reals, which is approximately from 1 US dollar to 15 US dollars. The children are between 10 and 17 years old. In some cases, the families are involved in the prostitution.

<doc id="140707" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140707" title="Child grooming">
Child grooming

Child grooming is a term which describes the following situation. When an adult becomes friends with a child, this is sometimes done for a reason. The reason is to lower the inhibitions of the child and to prepare for sexual abuse. So, action taken by an adult to form a trusting relationship with a child, with the intent of later having sexual contact, is 'child grooming'. 

The act of grooming a child may include activities that are legal, but later lead to sexual contact. The grooming is done to gain the child's trust, and the trust of those responsible for the child. Children are less likely to report a crime if it involves someone the child knows, trusts, and cares about. Also, a relationship with the family means the child's parents will be less likely to believe any accusations.


Sexual grooming of children also occurs on the internet. Some abusers pose as children online and make arrangements to meet with them in person.

In 2003, MSN implemented restrictions in their chat rooms purportedly intended to help protect children from adults seeking sexual conversations with them. In 2005, Yahoo! chat rooms were investigated by the New York State attorney general's office for allowing users to create rooms whose names suggested that they were being used for this purpose. That October, Yahoo! agreed to "implement policies and procedures designed to ensure" that such rooms would not be allowed.

An organization called Perverted-Justice (known as PJ) uses PJ operatives posing as underage teens on the internet to identify potential child molesters and turn the information over to the police and the courts. The news program "Dateline NBC" features the recurring segment "To Catch a Predator", based on documenting such activities.

An organization called Crisp Thinking has created a service intended to identify grooming and warn parents, allowing them to install software that studies chat room and other Instant messaging logs for activity they have determined may identify grooming or other potentially suspicious activities. It has also adapted its technology to social networking services and ISPs.

Another software company in the UK has developed a program that hold as competitor to Crisp, called Sentry Parental Controls. It was launched by television personality Coleen Nolan and is supported by Mark Williams-Thomas, a leading expert in child protection.

Cynic

The Cynics (, ) were an important group of philosophers from the ancient school of Cynicism. Their philosophy taught that the purpose of life was to live a life of Virtue in agreement with Nature. This meant rejecting all the usual desires for wealth, power, health, and fame, and by living a life free from all possessions. People are reasoning creatures. They could therefore gain happiness by rigorous training and by living in a way which was natural for humans. They believed that the world belonged equally to everyone, and that suffering was caused by false judgments of what was valuable and by the worthless customs and conventions which surrounded society. Many of these thoughts were later absorbed into Stoicism.

The first philosopher to outline these themes was Antisthenes, who had been a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BCE. He was followed by Diogenes of Sinope, who lived in a tub on the streets of Athens, took Cynicism to its logical extremes, and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher. He was followed by Crates of Thebes who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism spread with the rise of Imperial Rome in the 1st century, and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the Empire. It finally disappeared in the late 5th century, although many of its ascetic and rhetorical ideas were adopted by early Christians.

I caught somebody creating multiple accounts a couple weeks ago yet I could do nothing cause no admin/'crat was on. I may not be as active as I used to be but that's cause I'm trying to get out of the house more and push my self...I think I could make a great Admin. The question is do you think the same? As for the stuff on the censorship for DYK nominations...you wouldn't deny me Adminship cause I stand up for what I believe in would you?

<doc id="140775" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140775" title="Kerberos (protocol)">
Kerberos (protocol)

Kerberos (pronounced "kur-ber-uhs") is a computer network authentication protocol, which allows people communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner. It is also a suite of free software published by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that implements this protocol. Its designers aimed primarily at a client-server model, and it provides mutual authentication — both the user and the server verify each other's identity. Kerberos protocol messages are protected against spying and replay attacks.

Kerberos performs authentication as a trusted third party authentication service by using cryptographic shared secret under the assumption that packets traveling along the insecure network can be read, modified, and inserted. Kerberos builds on symmetric-key cryptography and requires a key distribution center. Extensions to Kerberos can provide for the use of public-key cryptography during certain phases of authentication.

MIT developed Kerberos to protect network services provided by Project Athena. The protocol was named after the Greek mythological character "Kerberos" (or "Cerberus"), known in Greek mythology as being the monstrous three-headed guard dog of Hades. Several versions of the protocol exist; versions 1–3 used only internally at MIT.

Steve Miller and Clifford Neuman, the primary designers of Kerberos version 4 (which used the DES encryption algorithm with 56-bit keys),
published that version in 1989, although they had targeted it primarily for Project Athena. 
Version 5, designed by John Kohl and Clifford Neuman, appeared as RFC 1510 in 1993 (made obsolete by RFC 4120 in 2005), with the intention of overcoming the limitations and security problems of Version 4. The MIT makes an implementation of Kerberos Version 5 freely available, under a software license similar to that used by BSD license.

Several companies used Kerberos Version 5 in commercial software including:

In 2005, the IETF Kerberos working group introduced a new updated specifications for Kerberos Version 5 . updates include:

In 2007, MIT formed the Kerberos Consortium for continuation of development.

Kerberos uses as its basis the Needham-Schroeder protocol. It makes use of a trusted third party authentication known as "key distribution center (KDC)", which consists of two logically separate parts: an Authentication Server (AS) and a Ticket Granting Server (TGS). Kerberos works on the basis of "tickets" (called Kerberos tickets) which serve to prove the identity of users.

Kerberos database: The key distribution center (KDC) maintains a database of secret keys; each entity on the network — whether a client or a server — shares a secret key known only to itself and to the KDC. Knowledge of this key serves to prove the identity of each entity. For communication between two entities, the KDC generates a session key which they can use to secure their communications.

The term "Kerberos server" generally refers to the KDC. For reliability purposes, it is possible to have backup KDCs. These are referred to as "Kerberos slave servers". All slaves synchronize their databases from the master Kerberos server. 

The term "Kerberized application server" generally refers to Kerberized programs that clients communicate with using Kerberos tickets for authentication. For example, the Kerberos telnet server is an example of a Kerberized application server . While the term The term "Kerberized applications" is used to referrer to the client side of Kerberized application server , For example, the Kerberos telnet client is an example of a Kerberized applications

The security of the protocol depends heavily on:

The following abbreviations will be used:

Briefly, the client authenticates to AS using a long-term "shared secret" and receives a ticket from the AS. Later the client can use this ticket to get additional tickets for SS using the same shared secret. These tickets can be used to prove authentication to SS.

Civil disobedience

Civil disobedience is the active refusal to obey certain laws, demands and commands of a government, or of an occupying power, without resorting to physical violence. It is one of the primary tactics of nonviolent resistance. 

The American author Henry David Thoreau pioneered the modern theory behind this practice in his 1849 essay "Civil Disobedience", originally titled "Resistance to Civil Government".

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (also known as Mahatma Gandhi) used non-violent civil disobedience in South Africa in a campaign for civil rights for the people who came from India and lived in South Africa. This campaign was from 1893-1914. When Gandhi returned to India, he used civil disobedience in the campaign for the independence of India from the British rule.

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, and young activists in the American civil rights movement of the 1960s also adopted civil disobedience techniques, during and after the Vietnam War.

Naturism

Naturism or nudism (from Latin "nudus" - "nude") is a term used by many action groups in society. These action groups usually want to spread the news that being naked is a good feeling, even around other people, and often with males and females mixed together. Usually, nakedness is seen without any relation to sex. Rather, these action groups want to enjoy common activities in the nude, like bathing. Often, they also want to do things nude where this is not really necessary, like naked bicycle tours.

It is difficult to know exactly when naturism began as an action group. In 1903, Paul Zimmermann opened the first club, "Freilichtpark" (in English, "Free Light Park"), near Hamburg, Germany. In the United States, German immigrant Kurt Barthel organized the first nudist event in the forest just outside of New York City. His club was called "the American League for Physical Culture" (ALPC) and started in the late 1920's. Zimmermann's vice president was a man named Ilsley Boone. Boone had been a minister (religious leader) of a large church. He quit to become involved with naturism all the time, and soon replaced Zimmermann as president. Also, he renamed the ALPC as the "American Sunbathing Association." Since 1995, it is known as the "American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR)."

Naturists come from many different social classes and backgrounds, and practice naturism for very different reasons. In addition, religion can effect how people dress. Islam generally does not allow anyone to be seen naked by others, except married couples in private, and young children by their parents and caregivers. Traditional Judaism is similar, but less strict about a group of people of the same sex. In India, Hinduism and Jainism have a few rituals with male nudism. Buddhism has little to say about naturism. If practiced, it is considered more of a way of living, than anything religious. Within Christianity, nudity and naturism are probably the most complicated of all religions. Many Christians have similar views as those of traditional Judaism, the religion from which Christianity began and grew out of. Others, called "Christian naturists," believe it is alright to be nude, and even to live nude, unless it is for the wrong reason or forced. The human body is considered by them to be the greatest creation of God, and is neither shameful nor should be covered. In addition, they believe it was the devil, not God, who told Adam and Eve that they were naked upon eating from a fruit tree which was not theirs.

A bijection (or bijective function) is a function that is both injective and surjective. A bijection is sometimes called a "one-to-one mapping", or a "one-to-one correspondence". 

This is the same as saying: a function formula_1 with domain formula_2 and codomain formula_3 is bijective if and only if formula_4 and formula_5 are different whenever formula_6 and formula_7 are different, and every element formula_8 of formula_3 has an element formula_6 of formula_2 where formula_12.

If formula_1 is a bijection from formula_2 to formula_3 then its inverse, formula_16, is a bijection from formula_3 to formula_2.

The Kansas Turnpike is a road in Kansas, part of the United States. The road is a "turnpike"—a payment must be made to use it. The road is 236 miles, or 380 kilometers, long. It starts at the line between Kansas and Oklahoma, and goes to Kansas City. It runs through many important cities in Kansas, including Wichita, Topeka, Lawrence, and Kansas City. The Kansas Turnpike is owned and repaired by the Kansas Turnpike Authority (KTA), which is based in Wichita.

The Kansas Turnpike was built between 1954 and 1956. It was built before the Interstate Highway System. The turnpike was not part of the Interstate System at first. However, it became part of the system in 1956. Parts of the turnpike also are parts of four Interstate Highways: I-35, I-335, I-470, and I-70.

Around 120,000 people use the Kansas Turnpike every day. KTA helps users by running a radio station about the road. It has also built places called "service areas" where people can stop and rest, and buy gasoline and things to eat. One service area has a memorial to American football coach Knute Rockne, who died near the turnpike.

The Kansas Turnpike Authority does not need tax money to pay for repairs to the road. The payments from users are used to pay for the repairs instead.

By 1944, no distinctions existed between the two series.

Originally produced by Harman-Ising Pictures, "Merrie Melodies" were produced by Leon Schlesinger Productions from 1933 to 1944. Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros. in 1944, and the newly renamed Warner Bros. Cartoons continued production until 1963.

John Dewey

John Dewey was born in Burlington, Vermont on October 20, 1859. He studied philosophy and graduated at the University of Vermont, and afterwards taught at many schools. In September 1882, Dewey went to the John Hopkins University and studied philosophy and psychology and published the paper, "The New Psychology". Afterwards, he taught psychology at universities and later on, got married to Alice Chipman. On 1886, he started a new school which came to be known as the "Dewey School". This school taught pragmatism, which says that a school's curriculum should be based on everyday life, lessons, and focuses on hands-on activities to better help students learn. After he retired as a teacher, he continued watching and figuring the society and politics. John Dewey died in 1952.

John Dewey believed in the "theory of inquiry", which shows how animals survived in their environment. He used the theory in the way he taught. He said that children learn best with real-life problems and hands-on activities. His most well-known essay was "The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology" (1896) which created the stimulus that became the response, which later became known as social behaviorism. For example, a person focuses on something, decides what to do, then acts on the decision.

The song is not whats usually heard from the band, and is one of the more straight-forward, upbeat songs, its also one of their most well-known singles.

The band are featured in this music video. It also shows girls in their Bikini and a swimming pool, and someone goes into it during the guitar solo so for a moment its kinda faded out, but then he goes back to the surface. At the start of this video, two people in a car get out and go inside to the party.

Blackpool tramway

The Blackpool tramway is a tramway that runs from Blackpool to Fleetwood, on the Fylde Coast in Lancashire, England. The tramway was built in 1885. It is one of the oldest electric tramways in the world and is the only one of the earliest tramways that is still in operation in the United Kingdom. 

The tramway is owned by Blackpool Borough Council and is run by Blackpool Transport as part of the "Metro Coastlines" network. The tramway runs for , and over 6,500,000 people travel on it each year. 

The first part of Blackpool tramway opened on 29 September 1885. It was a conduit line. It ran from Cocker Street to Dean Street on the Blackpool Promenade. This was one of the first practical electric tramways built in the world. It opened six years after Werner von Siemens first showed electric traction. At the opening was Holroyd Smith, the person who created the system, and Alderman Harwood, the Mayor of Manchester, along with many other people.

The "Blackpool Electric Tramway Company" ran the line until 1892. At this point, the lease on the line finished, and Blackpool Corporation then ran the line. In 1895 another line was added. It ran from Manchester Square along Lytham Road to South Shore. In 1897 the tracks were extended to South Pier. A line was also built on Station Road that connected Lytham Road to the promenade.

The conduit system was changed to overhead wires in 1899. In 1900 the line was built more to the north to Gynn Square. It linked up the "Blackpool & Fleetwood Tramroad" there. The Marton loop opened in 1901. It connected Talbot Square and Central Station along Church Street, Devonshire Square, Whitegate Drive, Waterloo Road and Central Drive. At Whitegate Drive in Marton a new depot was built. Another line was added from Talbot Square along Talbot Road to Layton on 1902. The promenade line had got as far as the Pleasure Beach by 1903.

The Blackpool Corporation took over the "Blackpool & Fleetwood Tramroad Company" in 1920. The Corporation got eight miles of track and three depots from the take-over. Two depots were in Fleetwood and one was in Bispham. The small Bold Street Depot in Fleetwood was closed and a new loop was built at Fleetwood Ferry.

The depot at Blundell Street was replaced by a bigger one on Rigby Road in 1920. In 1925 the line to Fleetwood was made more direct between Rossall and Broadwater. The last extension was built in 1926. It went along the promenade to Clifton Drive at Starr Gate. A connection was made there with the Lytham St Annes tracks.

The first route closure took place in 1936. They were the Central Drive and Layton routes. In 1961 Lytham Road closed, and Marton closed one year later. The tramroad line on Dickson Road to North Station closed in 1963. Marton and Copse Road Depots closed in the same year. The depot at Bispham closed in 1966. All that was left was the track running from Starr Gate to Fleetwood. It is still there today. The running of the buses and tramway was handed over to Blackpool Transport Services Limited in 1986 by Blackpool Borough Council.

Today the tramway runs from Starr Gate in Blackpool to the Ferry Terminus in Fleetwood. Most of the route runs along the Fylde Coast sea front. At Cleveleys the line turns inland for a few miles. It then returns to the coast in Fleetwood. There are four different types of track:


On the line there are four turning loops. One is at Starr Gate, another is opposite the Pleasure Beach and two more are at Little Bispham and Fleetwood. There is also one that links into Rigby Road Depot.

Blackpool runs a mix of double-deck and single-deck cars, though there are more single-deck trams in the fleet. The double-deck trams are used the most in the tourist season. The single-deck trams are not used as much at that time. They are sometimes used though when it is busy to let the system carry more passengers. Blackpool was the only town in the UK that kept its trams. Between 1962 and 1992 Blackpool was the only town with a tramway in the UK that was not a preserved system. The last English city to lose its trams was Sheffield in 1960. The last in the UK was Glasgow in 1962. Trams have been returning to the towns and cities in Britain since the Manchester Metrolink opened in Manchester in 1992.

There are lots of different trams in the fleet at Blackpool. Most of them were built in the 1930s and are still in service in an unchanged condition. Some others have had their bodywork changed. Sometime historic trams are borrowed from the National Tramway Museum in Crich and other museums for public service.
The trams from Starr Gate in the south to Fleetwood in the north. At busy periods such as the Blackpool Illuminations or on bank holidays services start or finish short at Cleveleys, Bispham or the Pleasure Beach. This means that more trams can run through the centre of Blackpool in a small period. When the Illuminations are on specially decorated trams carry passengers along the promenade and the illuminated area. The area runs from Starr Gate to Bispham. Until the opening of the Metrolink, Fleetwood was the only town in England that kept trams running down the main street.

In November 2007 the whole tramway closed for the first time. It was closed for five months for the second part of an £11,800,000 upgrade. Blackpool Transport Services and Blackpool Council currently have a joint bid awaiting Government approval. It could give up to £77,000,000 for a total upgrade of the trams and tracks. In January 2007 the City Class 611 prototype "supertram" was being tested on the tramway. It caught fire as it approached Central Pier. This caused lots of damage. The driver managed to get out of the cab. The tram was built by Mersyside based Tram Power. It was being tested as part of a bid to replace the current trams.. The same tram had already derailed on 30 May 2006 at Starr Gate loop in trials then. A Rail Accident Investigation Board report said that the derailmet was because of wear and tear on the track. They said another factor was the new type of running gear on the two-car prototype.
The company paid £150,000 to rebuild the tramcar. It cannot be re-tested until November 2008 at the earliest though. This is because testing is not allowed during the busy summer months and also because of the earlier closure of the tracks for repairs.
A £1 billion bid for a Government grant was made in 2002 by Blackpool Council and Lancashire County Council after the Government made a to build 25 new tram networks by 2010. They want to expand the tram network to include St Annes to the south and new housing estates in Fleetwood to the north. There is a possible further phase to include links to Poulton-le-Fylde and Thornton. In 2004 campaigners behind the bid expressed disappointment that nothing had been done to take the plans forward in two years. By November 2007 there was no further development.

Ancient Church of the East

The Ancient Church of the East separated from the Assyrian Church of the East. This happened because Mar Shimun XXIII, the patriarch of Assyrian Church of the East introduced reforms which were not supported. These reforms included changes such as those of using the new Roman calendar rather than the old calendar. The people who did not support the changes thought they were opposed to the sanctity of being one of the oldest Christian churches in the world. For this reason, the followers of the Ancient Church of the East resisted the changes made to the church. Mar Thoma Darmo, a native of Mesopotamia, who was Metropolitan of the Assyrian Church of the East in India from 1952 to 1968, based at Trichur separated from the Assyrian Church of the East. He became the head of the Ancient Church of the East in October 1968 and moved to Baghdad. He died the following year. Following his death, Mar Addai II was elected to replace him.

Cleartext

In telecommunications, cleartext is the form of a message or data which is in a form that is immediately understandable to a human being without additional processing. In particular, it implies that this message is sent or stored without cryptographic protection. The phrases, "in clear", "en clair" and "in the clear" are the same. 

It is close to, but not entirely the same as, the term "plaintext". Formally, plaintext is information that is fed as an input to a coding process, while ciphertext is what comes out of that process. Plaintext might be compressed, coded, or otherwise changed before the coding process is done, so it is quite common to find plaintext that is not cleartext.

Websites using insecure HTTP send using cleartext, with all data supplied (including usernames and passwords) being sent from the user's computer through the internet using cleartext. Anyone with access to the medium used to carry the data (the routers, computers, telecommunications equipment, wireless transmissions, and so on) may read the password, username, and anything else sent to the website.

Session key

A session key is a single-use symmetric key used for encrypting all messages in one communication session. A closely related term is traffic encryption key or TEK, which refers to any symmetric key that is used to encrypt traffic messages. Typically TEKs are changed frequently, in some systems daily and in others for every message.

Session keys introduce complexities in a cryptosystem. However, they also help with some real problems, which is why they are used. There are two primary reasons for using session keys:

Like all cryptographic keys, session keys must be chosen so that they are unpredictable by an attacker. In the usual case, this means that they must be chosen randomly. Failure to choose session keys (or any key) properly is a major drawback in any cryptosystem.

The Kite Runner is a 2003 book written by Khaled Hosseini.

In "The Kite Runner", Amir and Hassan grow up together in Afghanistan like brothers, although they could not be more different. Amir is the son of a wealthy businessman, a Sunni Muslim, a Pashtun. He is educated and loves to read and write. Hassan's father Ali is a servant to Amir's father. Hassan is a Sh'ia Muslim and a Hazara. He can not read and has a harelip. Neither boy has a mother, although Baba's friend, Rahim Kahn, has a close friendship with Amir. They spend their boyhoods roaming the streets of Kabul together. Amir is a selfish friend to Hassan, who is devoted and loyal to Amir. One day, he hides in fear as Hassan is beaten and raped by three bullies, led by a boy called Assef, when Hassan refuses to give them a kite that he found for Amir. After this, he cannot bear to talk to Hassan and pretends to his father that Hassan stole his watch so that Hassan will be sent away. Although his father forgives Hassan, Ali and Hassan decide to leave. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan sends Amir and his father escaping to the United States, because Amir's father has been known to curse the Communists. Amir is called back to Afghanistan, by a terminally ill Rahim Kahn, as an adult during the Taliban rule to rescue Hassan's son Sohrab, when Rahim tells him that he and Hassan are actually brothers because his father secretly had sex with Hassan's mother. When rescuing Sohrab, Amir has to confront Assef who is now a leader of the Taliban. He gets severely beaten by Assef and Sohrab eventually saves him by firing a slingshot at Assef's eye. He goes home with Amir to live with him and his wife Soraya, but does not talk or play. Eventually, Amir gets Sohrab to smile when he teaches him to fly a kite.

<doc id="140929" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140929" title="Combined oral contraceptive pill">
Combined oral contraceptive pill

The combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) often shortened to birth-control pill or simply the Pill is a contraceptive for women. The pills contain hormones that make the women who take them infertile. Women who take the pill will not become pregnant during sexual intercourse, they will not have babies if they do not want to. When the women stop taking the pills, they will usually become fertile again. When taken as prescribed, the pills are one of the safest means of contraception. Women who take the pill will not become pregnant during sexual intercourse; they will not have babies if they do not want to.

In the 1950s the hormone progesterone was discovered to stop women from making eggs (stopped ovulation). The combined oral contraceptive pill was developed following this find. The combined oral contraceptive pill has both female hormones estrogen and progesterone. Some oral contraceptive pills have only progesterone. These are often known as the "minipill".

The combined oral contraceptive pill is considered safe and working.

The contraceptive method was brought out in the United States in 1960. When a woman uses the Pill in the right way, it is are extremely effective at preventing pregnancy. At the same time it lets a woman and her man have sexual intercourse whenever they wish, without reducing the pleasure of sex. During intercourse, neither the woman who is using the pill nor the man having sex with her will be conscious of it at all. For these reasons, the Pill is a very popular method of birth control. Different pills exist which are mainly different in the kinds of hormones they use.

In 2005 more than 80 million women worldwide used the pill. It is the most commonly used method of contraception in the United States. Usage varies widely by country, age, education, and marital status.

The choice of contraception and whether or not it is available varies by country. One quarter of women aged 16–49 in United Kingdom were using the Pill as at 2006 (combined pill or progestogen only pill ("minipill")), compared to only 1% of women in Japan. 

Whether or not people use the pill may also be influenced by local culture and habits.
In some countries women do not really have a choice. If they want to use contraception, they must rely on one type of contraception. In some countries (such as Algeria, Morocco, and Zimbabwe) the pill is the most common method offered by national family planning programs. In other countries, national family planning programs offer only female sterilization (India) or only the IUD, intrauterine device (Egypt and Vietnam).

There are different kinds of COCPs. There are two main kinds of pills, those that contain both estrogen and progesterone , or those that contain progesterone only. Note that the pills do not contain the hormones themselves, but other chemical substances that are very similar, but that have been made in the laboratory. Estrogen stops the breast from producing milk; Women who are breastfeeding should therefore not be given pills that have estrogen in them. There are a few other coditions, where women should not be given estrogen. These women can use the progesterone-only pills.

There are pills where the concentration of the hormones change from week to week. Also the levels of hormones are different in different kinds of pills. The same pill may exist with different levels of hormones.

Like with most forms of birth control there are two ways to measure how effective COCPs are:
Rates are generally presented for the first year of use. Most commonly the Pearl Index is used to calculate effectiveness rates, but some studies use decrement tables.

The typical use pregnancy rate among COCP users varies depending on the population being studied. It is between 2 % and 8% per year. The perfect use pregnancy rate of COCPs is 0.3% per year.

There are several reasons why typical use effectiveness is lower than perfect use effectiveness:

People might have been given wrong information as to how often the pill should be taken, or they might have forgotten to take a pill once, or they might not have bothered to go to the pharmacy to get new pills. 

COCPs can provide effective contaception, if the first pill is taken no later than 5 days after the start of menstruation. If the treatment is started at any other time in the menstrual cycle, COCPs cannot provide a safe means of contraception for the first 7 days of use. During this time, other forms of contraception need to be used. When active pills have been taken for 7 days,COCPs can provide effective contaception. COCPs should be taken at approximately the same time every day.

Certain things can lower efficiency and protection level:

Certain other drugs can interact with COCP, and change their effectiveness. They also sometimes cause breakthrough bleeding. These drugs include:
Broad spectrum antibiotics, such as ampicillin and doxycycline, may cause problems "by impairing the bacterial flora responsible for recycling ethinylestradiol from the large bowel" (BNF 2003).

The traditional medicinal herb St John's Wort has also been implicated due to its upregulation of the P450 system in the liver.
"The Pill" contains hormones. It can therefore also be used to treat a number of problems that result from problems with hormone levels. Probably the best known of these conditions are:
The pill can also induce menstruation on a regular schedule for women bothered by irregular menstrual cycles and certain disorders where there is dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

Women who use combined oral contraceptives have a lesser risk of getting cancer of the ovaries. The risk can be reduced by half if the pill is taken for five years. Taking the pill also significantly reduces the risk of endometrial cancer by half compared to women who have never taken the pill. The risk reduction increases with duration of use. However, by taking the pill, the risk of cancer of the risk of breast and cancer of the cervix is increased.

Client-server

In Computer science client-server is a software architecture model consisting of two parts, client systems and server systems, both communicate over a computer network or on the same computer. A client-server application is a distributed system consisting of both client and server software. The client process always initiates a connection to the server, while the server process always waits for requests from any client. When both the client process and server process are running on the same computer, this is called a single seat setup.

Another type of related software architecture is known as peer-to-peer, because each host or application instance can simultaneously act as both a client and a server (unlike centralized servers of the client-server model) and because each has equivalent responsibilities and status. Peer-to-peer architectures are often abbreviated using the acronym P2P.

The client-server relationship describes the relation between the client and how it makes a service request from the server, and how the server can accept these requests, process them, and return the requested information to the client. The interaction between client and server is often described using sequence diagrams. Sequence diagrams are standardized in the Unified Modeling Language.

Both client-server and P2P architectures are in wide usage today.

The basic type of client-server architecture employs only two types of hosts: clients and servers. This type of architecture is sometimes referred to as two-tier. The two-tier architecture means that the client acts as one tier and server process acts as the other tier.

The client-server architecture has become one of the basic models of network computing. Many types of applications have being written using the client-server model. Standard networked functions such as E-mail exchange, web access and database access, are based on the client-server model. For example, a web browser is a client program at the user computer that may access information at any web server in the world.

Wikimedia current operates a Global Bots list. Instead of having to request a bot flag on each project, a user can request the global flag at Meta and is treated as a bot on all projects which allow global bots. Global bots are limited in what they can do; they can only deal with interwiki links and double redirect. Users requesting the flag on Meta must have it on several individual project first and a history of good contributions before getting the global flag. 

Each project that want to allow the global bots must opt-in to the process before the bots are allowed on that project. Because of this, community consensus needs to be reached on if we want to allow this here. Most IW bots are already effectively automatically granted the bot flag here if they meet the conditions required for the global so there really would be little change in the process from our point of view. There would likely be a drop in bot requests (not really a major issue) as well as more bots checking us regularly as they no longer would need to go through the application process to work here. Overall, it is likely we would not even notice any change outwardly, but more work would be going on behind the scenes. -- 02:35, 2 November 2008 (UTC)

So far as I can remember, at least in Da Punk '95 6, SwirlBoy39 3, and ChristianMan16 3, their status as banned en editors were not major reasons for why they could not muster up the consensus necessary to become admins.

So the question is – should "other wiki history" ever be a consideration, sometimes a consideration, or always a consideration? And why? () 06:16, 2 November 2008 (UTC)

History on other projects most definately should be taken into account. I dislike the fact that there are editors here who quite openly declare that they are banned on en.wiki. In some cases this is not entirely a bad thing. But using us to thumb their noses at en.wiki is not on. 15:19, 3 November 2008 (UTC)

The blurb about what Wikipedia is (on the front page) seems very condesgending, almost as if it is being directed at a two year old. It is full of exclamation points. What is up with that? I understand the need for simplicity of language, but overuse of exclamation points is going way too far. 

Should DYKs be any random article (such as stubs) or should DYKs be only content articles? Since most of the articles here on simple.wikipedia are stubs unlike en.wikipedia, should we change the rules for DYK to allow any article become a DYK? What does the community think? – () 02:04, 4 November 2008 (UTC)

Very basic question: Are we discussing that Gräfenberg Spot does not meet the criteria for inclusion, and should therefore be modified so it can be included, or is this about Gräfenberg spot being unsuitable for inclusion, as some people might be offended by it? -- () 19:35, 5 November 2008 (UTC)

hi all, i find some articles require necessary hard words, nouns usually, for which translation would be hard and misleading.
ex. skiing and the word 'mogul' or Guitar and 'fret'.

i propose a new template that would list the necessary difficult words in a small box of somesort. something like Template:Hardlist|word1|word2}} ?
with each word linking to simple wiktionary?
i dont know the procedure for creating such a thing.

good/bad idea? is it difficult to make?-- cheers. () 22:40, 6 November 2008 (UTC)

how? () 05:29, 12 November 2008 (UTC)

On the proposal for closure of this project (lol) someone has suggested changing the name to accomodate other languages in simple. I said I would link it here ~ .. 01:03, 7 November 2008 (UTC)

Made a draft page for a proposed process. It's important to keep it simple though, so the process here will be rather simplified. The draft page is , feel free to edit it or make comments on it. We do have disputes now and then, and having some sort of process for solving them, even if it's not used often, is a good idea, I think. 01:35, 7 November 2008 (UTC)

I think its a good idea. I've seen a number of smaller disputes here and some that are ongoing. DR is there to tell you how to handle it "when it happens". Image the time that it begins to happen, and there is no process. I'd rather having something set up right now, then to wait until things get so bad, that the process and information gets rushed; and we have an unworkable system with complex results and measures. 21:49, 7 November 2008 (UTC)

A lot of the templates here use different standards. I think it might be best if we standardise these, make them somewhat easier to edit, by converting the current templates to ones using the , , etc, format. I've started some already, if there aren't any objections in a day or so, I'll continue. 06:44, 7 November 2008 (UTC)

Mainstream

Mainstream is a term that usually refers to the common current of thought of the majority, meaning that "mainstream" things are those that are currently popular with "most" people. It is most often applied in the arts (i.e., music, literature, and performance). This includes:


The mainstream includes all popular culture, usually by mass media. An example of the opposite of the mainstream is counterculture. The term is sometimes used as a negative term. In the United States, Protestant with a mix of conservative, moderate, and liberal theologies are sometimes referred to as "mainstream."

Mainstream movies can best be defined as movies created for profit that have a wide release and play in first run theaters (a movie theater that runs mostly mainstream movies from the major movie companies and distributors, during the initial release period of each movie). Being sold at popular stores can also be an indicator. Hollywood and Bollywood movies are usually considered mainstream and also blockbusters. The boundary is vague. An example of the opposite of mainstream movie is typical art films.

In literature, "mainstream" refers to traditional realistic fiction, as opposed to genre fictions such as science fiction or mysteries.

Mainstream music refers to music that is familiar to and popular with the majority of people in their culture. For example, popular music or pop music. However, older generations often dislike the mainstream taste of the youth, and may not agree as to what is or is not mainstream.

Opposing mainstream music is the music of subcultures. This exists in most all genres of music and is commonly found in punk rock, indie rock, and extreme metal, among others. In the 1960s, this music was exampled by the music of the hippie counterculture. In more recent years, alternative rock, such as the music of Nirvana, has managed to maintain popularity in the mainstream music market even though their music did not to mainstream standards.

Punk rock has set itself apart from other non-mainstream genres by self-asserting an active "anti"-mainstream social movement that resists commercialism and corporate control. The punk subculture usually does not appreciate major label bands that play punk music that denies the do it yourself (DIY) punk ethic, and thinks they are the same as mainstream music. Indie rock that surfaced in the early 1990s underground took this same DIY ethic. Many anti-corporate and not-for-profit forms of alternative protest have surfaced in the punk underground, foe example, self-made publications known as "zines", where there is greater freedom to discuss controversial (usually far left) political issues such as bigotry, LGBT community issues, feminism, militant atheism, and veganism. And though the mainstream media often views this as a youthful expression of rebellion by, modern punk embodies a range of age groups who generally disagree with the perceived shared countercultural principals and it is not uncommon for middle-aged people to form punk houses (houses where people of the punk subculture live and open to others to stay, including touring bands) and resistance movements against what they see as the widespread, unfair use of human and animal rights for profit. This modern group is effectively voiced through the anarcho-punk and crust punk subcultures, in attempt to fight what is seen by those groups as a general of, and way to profit from, life.

Mainstreaming refers to a type of education where children with a learning disability are mixed into classes with children without learning disabilities to help them learn better and to become comfortable with the "mainstream" of student life and life in their community. This is normally called "integration". When their needs cannot be met, they must be moved to special schools.

Top Heatseekers

Top Heatseekers is a weekly music chart for albums introduced by "Billboard" in 1993. It was created to publish sales by new and developing musical recording artists. Albums that appear on Top Heatseekers may also appear on the "Billboard" 200 at the same time.

Top Heatseekers contains fifty chart positions. Although the chart's rules have changed a little bit over the years, its current rules for an album is to enter "Top Heatseekers" if it is one of the best-selling albums by a new or developing act (a band or musical artist), meaning an act that has never appeared in the top 100 of the "Billboard" 200. If an album on Heatseekers does enter the top 100 of the "Billboard" 200, it and any albums the act later releases are not eligible to appear on the Heatseekers chart. Many artists have bypassed Top Heatseekers because their first chart entry debuted on the "Billboard" 200 at position 100 or above.

<doc id="140982" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140982" title="Subculture">
Subculture

A subculture is a group of people with a culture (whether distinct or hidden) which makes them different from the larger culture that they belong to, known as the "dominate" culture. If a subculture is described as opposing the dominant culture, it may be described as a counterculture. As Ken Gelder notes, subcultures are social, with their own shared rules, values and rituals, but they can also seem self-involved—another thing that makes them different from countercultures.

Subcultures can be shown to be different because of the age, race, ethnicity, social class, location, or gender of the members. The qualities that determine a subculture as different from each other may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors. Members of a subculture often signal each other through the use of fashion style, certain behaviors, and use of a secret language created to prevent others not in their group from understanding them (this is known as Argot). They also live out particular relations to places: Ken Gelder talks about 'subcultural geographies' along these lines.

The study of subcultures often involves the study of symbolism attached to clothing, music and other visible things by members of subcultures, and also the ways that these same symbols are seen and understood by members of the dominate culture. Subcultures have been documented by others for a long time. In some cases—such as homeless people, criminal gangs or skateboarders—subcultures have had laws created to control or end their activities. But subcultures also talk about themselves, very often.

Lapis lazuli

Lapis lazuli is a metamorphic rock. It is famous for its beautiful blue colour. Its name means "stone of blue", and comes from the word "lazward", from Ancient Persia (now known as Iran and Afghanistan). Lapis Lazuli has been used for many things. Its has been made into beads and used in jewellery since Prehistoric times. It can be carved into statuettes (little sculptures). The major use was as a "pigment" (colour) in artists' paint. During Medieval and Renaissance times, Lapis lazuli was ground up into powder, and mixed into paint as the colour for painting the sky and the robe of the Virgin Mary. It can be seen in the fresco paintings of Giotto and the tempera paintings of Fra Angelico. 

Lapis lazuli is a metamorphic rock made from several minerals. The main mineral in Lapis lazuli is Lazurite. Lazurite is a silicate mineral with sulfate, sulfur and chloride. Its formula is (Na,Ca)(AlSiO)(SO,S,Cl). 
Lazurite has been mined for over 6,000 years in the district of Badakhshan in Afghanistan. It is also mined at Lake Baikal in Siberia; at Mount Vesuvius in Italy; in Burma; Canada; and the United States.

Controlled language

Controlled natural languages (CNLs) are artificial languages built by simplifying the grammar and reducing the number of words in the language to avoid ambiguity or complexity. 

There are two types of controlled languages: some designed to help non-native speakers of a language, and some designed to enable automatic semantic analysis.

The first type of languages (often called "simplified" or "technical" languages) are used by businesses or industries to improve the quality of technical writing, and possibly simplify the (semi-)automatic translation to other languages. For example, the ASD Simplified Technical English, Caterpillar Technical English, and IBM's Easy English.

These languages guide the writer by general rules such as "write short and simple sentences", "use the person's name ("John Smith" for example) instead of saying "him", and "talk about who is doing something, rather than what is being done, unless you need to say what is being done".

The second type of languages have a well defined rules of construction and interpretation, and can be matched to formal languages, such as first-order logic. Those languages can be used to handle information, to support fully automatic checks to test that they are correct and to search for information easily.

Existing logic-based controlled natural languages include:

An artificial language is a language made by people. It is usually a natural language cannot be used. These languages can be based on an existing language or can be totally made up.

If an artificial language does not serve the goal of general-purpose communication (as natural languages do), then it is necessarily a second language.

Benozzo Gozzoli

Benozzo Gozzoli (1420-1498) was an Italian Renaissance painter. He is most famous for a small chapel that he decorated with frescos of the "Procession of the Magi". 

Benozzo was born in Florence in about 1420. Nothing is known about his parents, or how he started training as an artist. The first that is known of him is that in 1444 he was working with the famous sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti, who was making the bronze doors for the Baptistry of Florence Cathedral. 

In 1447 he started working with the painter Fra Angelico. He went to Rome with Fra Angelico to help paint the Chapel of Pope Nicholas V in the Vatican. In 1449 he was working in his own studio.

For many years Benozzo worked as an assistant to other artists. At that time, he had to make his style match the style of the master, so it is hard to tell his art works apart. When Benozzo painted on his own, his pictures are rich with many details in the clothing, the buildings and the landscape. He was extremely good at painting faces, and many of the people in his pictures seem to be portraits of real people.

Falls Apart was a single released by Thousand Foot Krutch in 2007. It was made available online in July 2007. It is on their album The Flame in All of Us.

The "Falls Apart" video starts off showing the band in a dark wood room, with lots of rope around them. The members only have enough room to play their instruments. Eventually a man and a woman are shown and they are being held together by ropes. The man walks over to the woman and puts his arm around her. After a while she gets up and starts walking away, but then the ropes come off around everyone (the band and the couple alike). Because of this all of the body parts of the couple lie on the floor. But the man's hand crawls to the woman's hand and they hold each other while the band ends the song.

As they are walking they are fired at by unseen enemies and one soldier (Joel) goes down; before Joel dies he hands Trevor a piece of paper. As the trio as eating dinner by a fire, Trevor starts singing the song and reads the paper, Trevor then proceeds to go to Joel's grave. Then a flash back occurs in which Trevors realizes that if he had not have made Joel go in the one direction Joel would have not been shot; also in the flash back it shows Trevor dying instead of Joel.

Cowra, New South Wales

Cowra is a city in the central west of New South Wales, Australia. It is in Cowra Shire. It is 310m above sea-level and about 300 km west of Sydney. Cowra is on the banks of the Lachlan River.

The first name for Cowra was "Coura Rocks". This may have been the name of one of the first cattle farms. This name is probably the name of the river ford (crossing) where people could cross the Lachlan River.

The name Cowra comes from a local aboriginal word meaning "eagle on the rocks".

It should not be confused with another New South Wales town named Corowa.

The first people to live in the area were the Wiradjuri people. The first European explorer, George Wilson Evans, came into the Lachlan Valley in 1815. He named the area the Oxley Plains after his boss, the Surveyor-General, John Oxley. In 1817 he said the area was "unfit for white settlement". An army camp was set up soon after at Soldiers Flat near present day Billimari. Arthur Ranken and James Sloan, from Bathurst, were amongst the first European settlers on the Lachlan. They moved to the area in 1831.

The township of Coura Rocks began in 1840. By 1847 the township was called Cowra. The village was officially listed in 1849. 

In the 1850s many people looking for gold went through on their way to the gold fields at Lambing Flat (Young) and Grenfell. The first school was started in 1857. The first bridge over the Lachlan River was built in 1870. Gold was found at Mount McDonald in the 1880s. The railway, from Sydney, reached Cowra in 1886. Local government started in 1888. The first telephone were connected in 1901. The town water supply was started in 1909, the gas in 1912, and town supplied electricity was connected in 1924.

Cowra is home to the Australian copy of the United Nation's World Peace Bell. These are normally kept in a nation's capital city. It was given to Cowra because of its special role in international understanding, world peace and as a centre of world friendship.

During World War II Cowra was the site of a prisoner of war (POW) camp. Most of the prisoners were captured Japanese and Italian soldiers, sailors and airmen. On August 5, 1944 about 545 (some sources say over 1000) Japanese POWs attempted a mass escape from the camp. This is perhaps the largest prison escape in the world. At the same time, other Japanese prisoners killed themselves, or were killed by their countrymen, inside the camp.

The POWs tried to capture machine gun posts, armed only with home made weapons. The Prime Minister John Curtin said this was a "suicidal disregard of life", and had no chance of success.

During the escape 231 Japanese and 4 Australian guards were killed, and 108 prisoners were wounded. The dead Japanese were buried in Cowra in a specially made Japanese War Cemetery. This is the only such cemetery in Australia. It also has some of the dead from the WWII air raids on Darwin. 

An Avenue of Honour also remembers those who died in World War I.

The Japanese War Cemetery was looked by members of the Cowra RSL and given to Japan in 1963. In 1971 the Cowra Tourism Development decided to celebrate this link with Japan. They planned a Japanese Garden for the town. The Japanese Government agreed to help as a sign of thanks for the respectful treatment of their war dead. The garden also received money from the Australian Government and private groups.

The garden was designed by Ken Nakajima (1914 - 2000). He was a world famous designer of Japanese gardens. The first part was opened in 1979, with a second part opened in 1986.

The gardens were built in the style of the Edo period. They are a "kaiyū-shiki" or strolling garden. They are designed to show all of the landscape types of Japan. At five hectares, the Cowra Japanese Garden is the largest Japanese garden in the Southern Hemisphere. An annual "Sakura Matsuri" (cherry blossom festival) is held in the gardens during late September and/or early October each year. The garden also has other events during the year.

Network computing is when computers work together over a network. Network computing is ""Storing and/or running applications in servers in a network"" This means that the network may use the power from all the networked computers to perform complex tasks. The network could also be for sharing files so that they can be looked at on any computer in the network easily.

Network computing is the opposite to "Stand-alone computing". This is where computers are not connect to a network. Most laptops and home computers do their jobs alone and are stand-alone computers.

<doc id="141067" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=141067" title="Loan">
Loan

A loan is a type of debt. The borrower needs to repay the lender the sum of money loaned part by part over time in order to clear the debt.

Acting as a provider of loans is one of the main tasks for financial institutions. For other institutions, issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a main source of funding. Bank loans and credit are one way to increase the money supply.

A loan can be broadly described by the following terms.

The deposit or down-payment is an amount of money that the borrower is required to pay, as the first contribution towards clearing the debt, so that the loan deal can be finalized. The deposit is usually higher than the monthly contribution towards the loan. Some loans require a deposit while some do not. The deposit is usually a fraction, typically a percentage, of the total amount that is loaned out.

An Installment is money that is a monthly payment towards the loan. It may not be necessarily paid monthly but it has to be paid from time to time over throughout the loan deal. Installments are paid according to a loan rate. 

Interest is a charge on top of the value of the loan, that acts as a cost of the loan. Interest is paid according to a rate called an interest rate. The interest rate varies from loan to loan and from lender to lender.

Loans can be broadly classified as either secured or unsecured loans.
Secured loans are loans for which the borrower is required to guarantee
Repayment, by pledging with property, for instance,a car, a house etc. This property is called security or collateral. Because of the pledging, secured loans are given in larger amounts and have lower interest rates. However, there is a risk of loosing the property used as security, in the event that the loan is not paid off.
An Examples of a Secured loans is mortgage.
Unsecured loans are loans that are given without pledges of repayment. This means that the borrower is not required to provide security to get the loan.
Because of the high risk involved, unsecured loans are given out in smaller amounts and have higher interest rates. The lenders raise the interest rates in an effort to recover their money as quickly as possible. Most personal loans are unsecured loans.
A personal loan is a 'small expense' loan that is mostly used by people to 
finance their day to day emergencies. They come in smaller amounts and
therefore, just like most unsecured loans, they are easily approved.

Home loans are loans that are taken for the purpose of buying a house.
Home loans are secured loans. The house acts as a collateral or security
to the loan. 
Payday loans are the easiest loans to get if you are employed. They are 
signature loans or cash advances that requires no security. This means that 
it is possible to get a payday loan even with a bad credit status or no credit 
at all. Payday loans are given on the basis of employment and income.

However, payday loans have a high interest rate especially when the paying
schedule is not followed. The high interest rates are a cost of convenience.
Interest could run as high as 2000%, for this reason, it is not a good idea to
take a payday loan if you don't expect a salary.

Auto loans are loans given out by financial institutions or car dealerships, for the purpose of buying an automobile. Due to the nature of automobiles to loose value with time, Auto loans usually have high interest rates. The shorter the time an auto loan is paid, the lower the overall cost of the loan.
Mortgage is a loan that is used specifically to purchase a house. Usually, a mortgage is given to you by a mortgage company or any financial institution, after evaluation of your potential to pay back the loan in full. A mortgage is a secured loan, therefore, providing collateral is necessary. Mortgage can be further classified into long-term and short-term mortgages, depending on the length of time required for the mortgage to be paid. Short-term mortgages usually have a term of 15 years while long –term mortgages have a 30-year term.
When you get a credit card, you have taken a loan. This is a credit card loan, and just like any other loan, it comes with interest and fees. Credit card loans are given out by credit companies and most banks today. The interest rates on credit card loans are higher than that on most personal loans, often around 16%.

<doc id="141068" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=141068" title="Mortgage">
Mortgage

A mortgage is a way to use one's real property, like land, a house, or a building, as a guarantee for a loan to get money. Many people do this to buy the home they use for mortgage: the loan provides them the money to buy the house and the loan is guaranteed by the house.

In a mortgage, there is a debtor and a creditor. The debtor is the owner of the property, while the creditor is the owner of the loan. When the mortgage transaction is made, the debtor gets the money with the loan, and promises to pay the loan. The creditor will receive money back with interest over time (usually in payments made each month by the debtor). If the debtor does not pay the loan, the creditor may take the mortgaged property in place of the loan. This is called foreclosure.

In the 2008 American economic failure, creditors lent money to debtors who could not pay back that money. This lowered housing prices and hurt the economy.

The borrower promises to repay the borrowed money on a certain date. The borrower transfers the property to the lender. The lender will retransfer the property when the money is repaid.

A reverse mortgage is a loan where the lender pays the monthly installments to the borrower instead of the borrower paying the lender. The payment stream is reversed. A reverse mortgage allows people to get tax-free income from the value of their home. They are mainly to improve older people's personal and financial independence.

The takes the property. The lender receives income from the property (rent, profit, interest, etc) until the money is paid back. The owner keeps the title deeds.

Niki FM is a song by Hawthorne heights. It is one of their most famous songs, and their second hit.

The band's singer, JT, says it is his most personal song from the album "The silence in black and white", and is his favourite song to perform live in concert. They still play it at concerts, although without the harsh vocals that are on the single.

The music video for Niki FM starts with a room with a lot of people in. JT is at the front, and someone in the audience is touching someone's leg. The video also includes JT being kissed by another woman. It shows him in a room tearing a picture in two and he stares at it. He has a radio and goes outside the young woman's house to match with the lyrics "I'm outside of your window, with my radio". The girl walks away and leaves him, and the song finishes.

Riemann sum

In mathematics, a Riemann sum is a sum that makes an approximation of the total area underneath a curve on a graph. The area can be known as the integral. It may also be used to define the integration operation. The sum is named after a German mathematician who was called Bernhard Riemann.

You divide the horizontal length under the part of the function you want to evaluate into "n" equal pieces. That is the n on top of the Σ (Greek letter sigma). The (x-x) represents the size of one horizontal segment that is created from dividing the whole by the "n". The f(y) is a y value in an "n" segment. Since the area of a rectangle is "length" × "width", the multiplication of x and f(y) is the area of a rectangle for that part of the graph. The Σ means we add up all of these small rectangles to get an approximation of the area under the segment of a function.

Asceticism

Asceticism (Greek: "askēsis") is a word that describes a certain life-style. This life-style is different from others mainly because those who practice it abstain from various sorts of worldly pleasures, especially sexual activity and drinking of alcohol. Often, their aim is to follow religious and spiritual goals. Christianity and the Indian religions (including yoga) teach that salvation and liberation involve a process of mind-body transformation that is done through practicing restraint with respect to actions of body, speech and mind. The founders and earliest practitioners of these religions (e.g. Buddhism, Jainism, the Christian desert fathers) lived extremely austere lifestyles. They rejected sensual pleasures and the accumulation of material wealth. This is to be understood not as an eschewal of the enjoyment of life but a recognition that spiritual and religious goals are impeded by such indulgence. Asceticism is closely related to the Christian concept of chastity and might be said to be the technical implementation of the abstract vows of renunciation. Those who practice ascetic lifestyles do not consider their practices as virtuous but pursue such a life-style in order to satisfy certain technical requirements for mind-body transformation. There is remarkable uniformity among the above religions with respect to the benefits of sexual continence. Religions teach that purifying the soul also involves purification of the body which thereby enables connection with the Divine and the cultivation of inner peace. In the popular imagination asceticism is considered a sort of perversion (self-flagellation by birch twigs as the archetypal stereotype of self-mortification) but the "askēsis" enjoined by religion functions in order to bring about greater freedom in various areas of one's life, such as freedom from compulsions and temptations bringing about peacefulness of mind with a concomitant increase in clarity and power of thought.

San Marco, Florence

St. Mark's, (S. Marco) in Florence, Italy is a church and Domincan convent. The church also has the Museum of St. Mark (Museo di S. Marco) which shows paintings by Fra Angelico. 

The Domincan Convent was begun in the early 1400s. The first "prior" (head man) was St. Antoninus of Florence. The famous painter known as Fra Angelico was one of the first of the Dominican Friars to live and work there. He later became the prior. The land for the convent was given to the friars by Cosimo Medici. The monks lived in small rooms called "cells". Cosimo had a cell built for himself, where he could stay sometimes. Between 1447 and 1452 Cosimo got his favourite architect, Michelozzo, to build a large new library and improve other parts of the building. In the late 1700s, the facade (front) of the building was rebuilt in a Classical style. 

In 1490, the prior of St. Marks was a famous Domincan called Savonarola. He lived in the cell that had once belonged to Cosimo Medici. He was a great preacher. He disliked Cosimo's grandson, Lorenzo Medici, who was often called "Lorenzo the Magnificent" (Lorenzo il Magnifico). He thought that Lorenzo had too much power and was acting like a prince. He preached against Lorenzo, against the Pope and against the Roman Catholic Church. He told everyone that the end of the world was near. Many people became frightened or depressed by the things that he said. Pope Alexander VI had Savonarola arrested. He was tortured and put to death in 1498. 60 years later, the Church agreed that, in fact, he had said nothing wrong. 

The Library of St. Mark's contains many illuminated manuscripts. Some were probably decorated by Fra Angelico's brother Benedetto. Some may even have been painted by Fra Angelico. 

The Museum has a collection of paintings by Fra Angelico. On of the most famous is "The Descent from the Cross", which shows the body of Jesus being taken down from the cross where he was crucified. The convent also contains many paintings by Fra Angelico. They are frescos, and decorated many walls, including a painting in each friar's cell. 

Another famous fresco is "The Last Supper" painted in the refectory (dining room) by Domenico Ghirlandaio.

Sadhus have given up trying to achieve the first three Hindu goals of life: kama (enjoyment), artha (practical objectives) and even dharma (duty). The sadhu is solely dedicated to achieving moksha (liberation) through meditation and contemplation of God. Sadhus often wear ochre-colored clothing, as a symbol that they have given up many things in life.

Afro-Asian

Afro-Asian, or Blasian, means a person of mixed race. Black African and East Asian. 

Ethiopians went to South Arabia in the 2nd century and the 4th century. By 532 AD they had invaded Yemen. After this, many more Africans came to South Arabia as slaves; men were usually traded, and the women were kept as servants for the Arab leaders. Mixed-race children were more valuable in South Arabia. Two such children became Princes of the Abbassids. At this time, the Arabian army, known as the Sabaens, moved to Ethiopia. In Iraq, Bantu-speaking Africans were called Zanj. The large number of Zanj slaves working in bad conditions in Iraq lead to the famous Zanj Rebellion over fifteen years (869-883 AD). African rebels took over many of Iraq's cities forcing Arabs to flee to African nations such as Kenya, Somalia, and Tanzania. Today someone of African and Arab descent is considered Afro-Arab.

A former slave by the name of Najah seized power in the 10th century and established the Banu Najah dynasty, the first royal Afro-Asian family.

As early as 1100 AD, African slaves were brought to India by Arab merchants in medieval times from the Bantu-speaking parts of eastern Africa. These Africans became known as Siddi or Habshi, Arabic word meaning Black African. Today, marriage has made the Siddi population in India much smaller. Someone of Indian and African background is considered an Indo-African. In South Asia there are over 15,000 individuals who identify as Afro-Asian.

In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed and Chinese workers who chose to stay in the U.S. could no longer be with their wives who stayed behind in China. Because White Americans looked at Chinese labor workers as stealing jobs, they were treated badly. Many Chinese men settled in black communities and in turn married black women.

Tiger Woods, a famous golf player, is of white, Chinese, Native American, Thai, and black descent; his father being half African American and his mother being half Thai. R&B singer Amerie is another famous Afro-Asian American, with her father being black and her mother Korean. Hines Ward, an NFL football player, is also an Afro-Asian. He currently plays for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

As of the census of 2000, there were 106,782 Afro-Asian individuals in the United States.

In the 1860s, Chinese people were imported for labor and trade. It became more common for a Chinese man to marry a black woman since there was more black women than Chinese women. According to the 1946 Census, 12,394 Chinese were located between Jamaica and Trinidad. 5,515 of those who lived in Jamaica were Chinese Jamaican and another 3,673 were Chinese-Trinidadians living in Trinidad.
In Guyana and Haiti, there is also a very small percentage within the minority who are of Asian descent.

Haitian painter Edouard Wah was born to a Chinese father and Haitian mother. Grace Jones is also part Chinese. 

The UK has a large mixed-race population, which is about 1.4% of the population (or around 850,000 people). The largest groups are mixed Whites and Black, and mixed Whites and Asians. However there are over 70,000 UK citizens that are mixed race and do not fit the above descriptions, a large percentage of these are Afro-Asian. Famous Afro-Asian Britons include Naomi Campbell, David Jordan.

RC6

In cryptography, RC6 is a symmetric-key block cipher derived from RC5. RC6 is a parameterized algorithm with a variable block size, a variable key size, and a variable number of rounds. RC stands for "Rivest Cipher", or alternatively, "Ron's Code".

In 1997, the NIST announced a competition to choose a successor to Data Encryption Standard (DES) to be known as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). RC6 was derived from RC5 to meet the competition requirements, and was selected as one of the "five finalists" of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition, but was not selected as a standard.

In order to provide varieties of security and efficiency levels, RC6 allows choices for the block size: 32 bits (for experimentation and evaluation purposes only), 64 bits (for use as a replacement for DES), and 128 bits (intended for AES). The number of rounds can range from 0 to 255, while the key sizes can range from 0 bits to 2040 bits in size. 

RC6 is very similar to RC5 in structure and could be viewed as interweaving two parallel RC5 encryption processes. However, RC6 does use an extra multiplication operation not present in RC5 and the use of four b/4-bit working registers (see splitting of plaintext blocks in feistel cipher) instead of two b/2-bit registers as in RC5 (b is the block size). Integer multiplication is used to increase the diffusion achieved per round so that fewer rounds are needed and the speed of the cipher can be increased.<br>The reason for using four working registers instead of two is mainly for optimization on 32-bit CPUs. The default block size of RC5 was 64 bits, while the default block size of the AES is 128 bits. RC5 has only two working registers. It uses 32-bit operations when dealing with 64-bit blocks and 64-bit operations when dealing with 128-bit blocks, so four working registers are required to build the AES architecture using only 32-bit operations.
RC6 is a proprietary and patented algorithm (by RSA Security and ), and may require licensing and royalty payments for any products using the algorithm. It was designed by Ron Rivest, Matt Robshaw, Ray Sidney, and Yiqun Lisa Yin, and was also submitted to the NESSIE and CRYPTREC projects.

RC5

In cryptography, RC5 is a simple symmetric-key block cipher. Designed by Ronald Rivest in 1994, RC5 is a parameterized algorithm with a variable block size, a variable key size, and a variable number of rounds. ""RC"" stands for "Rivest Cipher", or alternatively, "Ron's Code".

In order to provide varieties of security and efficiency levels; RC5 has a variable block size (32, 64 or 128 bits), variable key size (0 to 2040 bits) and variable number of rounds (0 to 255). The original suggested choice of parameters were a block size of 64 bits, a 128-bit key and 12 rounds. 

A key feature of RC5 is the use of data-dependent rotations; one of the goals of RC5 was to study and evaluate operations of block ciphers as a cryptographic primitive. RC5 also consists of a number of modular additions and eXclusive OR (Xor)s. The general structure of the algorithm is a Feistel-like network. The encryption and decryption routines can be specified in a few lines of code. The key schedule, however, is more complex, expanding the key using an essentially one-way function with the binary expansions of both e and the golden ratio as sources of "nothing up my sleeve numbers". The simplicity of the algorithm together with the novelty of the data-dependent rotations has made RC5 an attractive subject to study by cryptanalysts.

12-round RC5 (with 64-bit blocks) is susceptible to a differential attack using 2 chosen plaintexts. 18–20 rounds are suggested as sufficient protection.

RSA Security, which has a patent on the algorithm, offered a series of US$10,000 prizes for breaking ciphertexts encrypted with RC5, but these contests have been discontinued as of May 2007. A number of these challenge problems have been tackled using distributed computing, organised by Distributed.net. Distributed.net has brute-forced RC5 messages encrypted with 56- and 64-bit keys, and now is working on cracking a 72-bit key. At the current rate (as of November 12, 2008), it will take approximately 1,000 years to test every possible key to complete the project.

Altaic languages

Altaic is suggested as a language family. It would include 66 languages that are spoken by about 348 million people, mostly in and around Central Asia and northeast Asia.
According to the best-known classification of Altaic, it consists of the Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic language families. It is probably fair to say that this is the meaning attributed to "Altaic" by most general linguists. 

However, since the publication of Gustaf John Ramstedt's "Einführung" in 1952–1957, most Altaicists have included Korean in Altaic. Since the publication of Roy Andrew Miller's "Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages" in 1971, most have also included Japanese (Nicholas Poppe) or better Japonic, consisting of Japanese and Ryukyuan. 

A few linguists even count Ainu with the Altaic languages, but as part of a node including Korean and Japanese, in contradistinction to a Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic node, with Korean-Japanese-Ainu and Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic in turn forming a node at a higher level (e.g. Street 1962).

Mongolian language

The Mongolian language (, "Mongol kele", Cyrillic: Монгол хэл, "Mongol khel") is the best-known member of the Mongolic language family and the language of most of the residents of Mongolia, where it is officially written with the Cyrillic alphabet and of around three million Mongolian speakers in the "Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region" of China, where it is officially written with the traditional Mongolian script. It is also spoken in some areas in the Russian Far East and Kyrgyzstan. The majority of speakers in Mongolia speak the Khalkha (or "Halh") dialect, while those in China speak one of many Inner Mongolian dialects.

RC2

In cryptography, RC2 is a symmetric-key block cipher. Designed by Ronald Rivest in 1987. ""RC"" stands for "Rivest Cipher", or alternatively, "Ron's Code".

RC2 is a 64-bit block cipher with a variable key size and using 18 rounds.

Rounds are arranged as a source-heavy feistel network, with 16 rounds of one type called ""mixing rounds"" interleaved by two rounds of another type called ""mashing rounds"". 

The 18 rounds are performed using the following interleaved sequence: 

RC2 uses "key-expansion algorithm" by which an expanded key consisting of 64 (16-bit words) is produces depending in a complicated way on every bit of the supplied ""variable-length"" input key. A mixing round consists of four applications of the ""mix-up"" transformation, as shown in the diagram. A round is ""mashed"" by adding to it one of the 16-bit words of the expanded key (RFC 2268). 

RC2 is susceptible to a related-key attack using 2 chosen-plaintext attacks (Kelsey et al, 1997).

The development of RC2 was sponsored by Lotus, who were seeking a custom cipher be exported as part of their Lotus Notes software, after evaluation by the NSA. The NSA suggested a couple of changes, which Ronald Rivest incorporated. After further negotiations, the cipher was approved for export in 1989. 

Along with RC4, RC2 with a 40-bit key size was treated under US export regulations for cryptography. Now all 40-bit encryption algorithms are obsolete because they are dangerously susceptible to brute force attacks.

Initially, the details of the algorithm were kept secret — proprietary to RSA Security — but on 29th January, 1996, source code for RC2 was anonymously posted to the Internet on the Usenet forum, sci.crypt. A similar post had occurred earlier with RC4. It is unclear whether the poster had access to the specifications or whether it had been reverse engineered.

1999 East Timorese crisis

The 1999 East Timorese crisis was a conflict. Militia who did not like the independence in East Timor started the conflict when they attacked civilians. These attacks led to more violence all over the country. Most of the violence occurred in the capital Dili. 

The violence started after the result of an election was independence from Indonesia. About 1400 people are thought to have died. An UN force (InterFET) made up mainly of people from the Australian Defence Force was sent to East Timor to establish and maintain peace.

In 1999, there was a lot of pressure on Indonesia. Therefore, the Indonesian government decided to hold a vote. In this referendum it asked the people of East Timor, whether they wanted to stay with Indonesia or become independent. Portugal had done some lobbying. The referendum was held on August 30. In it, a clear majority (78.5%) of those voting said they would rather become independent. The alternative proposal would have been to stay with Indonesia, but to have many freedoms as an "autonomous province", called Special Autonomous Region of East Timor (SARET).

Directly after the referendum, violence broke out. The violence came from Indonesian soldiers and from a special East Timorese pro-integration militia which was supported by Indonesia. These troops became violent and terrorised the population. They did not like how the people had voted. About 14,000 Timorese people were killed. 300.000 had to flee to West Timor to live as refugees. Most of the infrastructure of the country, including houses, watering systems, and the electricity was destroyed. Noam Chomsky said: "In one month, this massive military operation murdered some 2,000 people, raped hundreds of women and girls, displaced three-quarters of the population, and demolished 75 percent of the country's infrastructure."

On 20 September 1999 the Australian-led peacekeeping troops of the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) came to the country. This ended the violence. Activists in Portugal, Australia, the United States, and elsewhere pressured their governments to take action. US President Bill Clinton eventually threatened Indonesia, that the IMF loans would be stopped. Indonesia was in deep economic troubles already. The Indonesian government agreed to withdraw its troops and allowed a multinational force into Timor to stabilize the area. It was clear that the UN did not have sufficient resources to fight the paramilitary forces directly. Instead, the UN authorised the creation of a multinational military force known as INTERFET (International Force for East Timor), with Security Council Resolution 1264. 17 nations sent troops, about 9,900 people in total. 4,400 came from Australia, the remainder mostly from South-East Asia. The force was led by Major-General Peter Cosgrove. Troops landed in East Timor on 20 September 1999.

Scandal

A scandal is a very public incident which involves a claim of wrong-doing, shame, or moral offence. A scandal may be about a real event, an untrue event (often called a ) or a mixture of both. Something which is a scandal can be described as scandalous.

Scandals may be told by , who have access to secrets and allow them to go public. A well-known scandal was the Watergate scandal, in which US President Richard Nixon was found to be supporting and hiding illegal burglaries. Untrue claims often lead to a loss of respect for that person, and can destroy their careers. Sometimes an attempt to cover up a scandal creates a bigger scandal when the cover-up does not succeed.

Manchester

Manchester is a place in England. In 2001, there were over 450,000 people, a population that makes it the 5th largest city in the United Kingdom.

It is a city and metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester, England. Manchester was given city status in 1853. As of 2001 Manchester has a population of . The city is in the middle of the Greater Manchester Urban Area, which has 2,240,230 people, and is the United Kingdom's third largest built-up place. 

Manchester is a very important city in England, and is called the second city of the UK. It has also been called the "Capital of the North". Manchester has many places for the arts, places for learning, businesses providing media as well as lots of shops. In a poll of British managers in 2006, Manchester was named the best place in Britain to have a business. A report in 2007 said Manchester is a fast-growing city (meaning lots of jobs are being created). Manchester was the host of the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Manchester United and Manchester City are football teams in the area.

Manchester was the first place to have big industry, because of the Industrial Revolution. It was the main place for making cloth and fabric. During the 19th century it had the nickname Cottonopolis, because it had so many cotton mills. The middle of Manchester is important because it is on UNESCO's World Heritage Sites, because of its network of canals and mills built during its 19th-century development.

In the late 1700s, Manchester was only a small village with a low population. This changed at the start of the Industrial Revolution. During this time, there were revolts about the living conditions for workers. The most well known of these revolts was the Peterloo Massacre. Fifteen to twenty people were killed during the Peterloo Massacre and hundreds of other people were hurt. In 1780, Richard Arkwright built the first cotton mill in the area.

Later in the 1800s, Manchester became most important cotton town in the world. It was also the first 'industrialised' city, meaning that it was the first city to have a big amount of industry in it. Only a small amount of cloth is still made in the city and the trade has mainly stopped. This left a big number of old buildings from that time including the Town Hall, Free Trade Hall and Central Library and left a lot of other buildings empty.

The Manchester Ship Canal was created by the digging of canals in the rivers Irwell and Mersey for from Salford to the Mersey estuary. This let ocean going ships sail into the Port of Manchester.

The county of Greater Manchester was made in 1974. The county was created from cities and towns in southern Lancashire and northern Cheshire (the two main areas which make up Greater Manchester), and some mainly rural districts of Derbyshire and Yorkshire.

In 1996, the Irish Republican Army put a bomb in a truck located in the centre of the city. Nobody was killed, but it did a lot of damage.

Manchester is located north-west of England's capital, London. The city has many canals and rivers which were a big part in its earlier growth. The largest open space in the city is Heaton Park. It has an area of about . Heaton Park is a place that attracts many people every year. People go there to see the many animals and the beauty of the countryside. Much of Manchester is built-up (or 'urbanised'). Much of Manchester's rain comes over from the Pennines, which are a hilly range to the south and east of the city. The city is mainly urban areas but also has some areas which are mainly of farmland. To the south of the centre is Manchester Airport. This is the third largest airport in the United Kingdom.

A revival of the city's importance started in the 1980s. This was partly led by a vibrant music scene whose spirit was labelled 'Madchester', which was led by bands such as The Happy Mondays and Joy Division. It was also partly fuelled by the big number of students attending the number of universities and further education colleges in the city. Manchester has the highest population of students in the United Kingdom in term time.

The largest university in the UK , the University of Manchester, is located in the city. It has over 30,000 students. It also has the fourth largest university, the Manchester Metropolitan University.

The city has two Premier League football teams, Manchester City and Manchester United. Football is a very important part of the culture of the city. Many of the population support or show interest in the sport.

Manchester and North West England are served by Manchester Airport. The airport has the most passengers in the UK outside London, with 22.1 million passengers in 2007. Planes fly to lots of in Europe, North America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East and Asia (with more destinations from Manchester than from London Heathrow).

Manchester is very well served by train and in terms of passengers, Manchester Piccadilly was the busiest English train station outside London in 2005 and 2006. Northern Rail operates all over the north of England, and other operators include Virgin Trains. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway was the first passenger railway in the world. Greater Manchester has a very big railway network. The city centre has over a lot of park and ride sites. Manchester became the first city in the UK to get a new tram system when the Manchester Metrolink opened in 1992. There are lots of new lines being built. 

The city has one of the biggest bus networks outside London with over 50 bus companies operating in the Greater Manchester area around the city. First Manchester and Stagecoach Manchester are the main bus operators. First Manchester also operates three free bus services called Metroshuttle which carry workers around Manchester's business areas.

A big canal network runs though the city, built in the Industrial Revolution, today mainly used for leisure. The Manchester Ship Canal is open, but not many boats use it.

Manchester's buildings display many different types of building styles, from Victorian to contemporary architecture. The very common use of red bricks characterises the look of the city. Much of the architecture in the city dates back to its days as a global centre for the trade of cotton. Just outside the city centre is a large number of former cotton mills, some of which have been left mostly untouched since they were closed, while many others have been turned into apartment buildings and office spaces.Manchester Town Hall, in Albert Square, was built in the gothic revival style and is thought of by many to be one of the most important Victorian buildings in all of England.

There are two universites in the City of Manchester. The University of Manchester, created in 2004 when Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST were combined, is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom. The Manchester Business School, located at the University of Manchester, was the first school to offer an MBA course in the United Kingdom in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was created as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It was given university status in 1992, and in the same year, combined with Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education, located in South Cheshire.

Manchester has twinning plans (or "friendship agreements") with lots of places. In addition, the British Council has a "metropolitan centre" in Manchester. Although not an official twin city, Tampere, Finland is known as ""the Manchester of Finland"" – or ""Manse"" for short. Also, Ahmedabad, India became the centre of a booming textile industry, and it got the nickname ""the Manchester of the East"."

Cryptographic protocol

A cryptographic protocol (also known as encryption protocol or security protocol) is an abstract or an existing protocol that performs a security-related function and applies cryptographic methods. 

A protocol describes how the cryptographic algorithms should be used to secure information. The description of a protocol must include details about all data structures and representations, and all details about how to utilize the protocol by programs.

Cryptographic protocols are widely used for secure application-level data transport, in order to secure transferred messages. A cryptographic protocol usually has at least some of these features:

The term "cryptographic protocol" is used in different ways. For example, cryptographic "application" protocols often use one or more underlying Key-agreement protocols which are also sometimes themselves referred to as "cryptographic protocols", like the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) which uses what is known as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, Diffie-Hellman may be seen as a complete "cryptographic protocol" in itself for other applications.

In antiquity, Livadeia was one of the Boeotian towns. Boeotians were an ancient Greek tribe which was a branch of the Dorian tribe. In Livadeia there was an oracle which was known by the name Trofonion. The Trofonion oracle was very important, although not as important as the Delphi oracle which was located nearby in the north. During the Middle Ages Livadeia was an insignificant town until about the thirteenth century when it became the capital of the Catalonian knights' domain. The Catalonian knights had conquered central Greece when they defeated the Lombard knights in a battle. Later, during the 15th century, the district was conquered by the Ottomans.

1840–1849 Atlantic hurricane seasons

I. On June 19, a tropical storm hit near Lake Charles, Louisiana. 

II. A hurricane hit near the mouth of the Rio Grande, destroying villages and causing flooding.

I. A strong tropical storm hit the Florida Panhandle on September 14.

II. An intense hurricane remained offshore of the Carolinas in early October. It moved northeastward, entraining cold air into its circulation. It became an extratropical storm, and hit New England on October 3. It led to a storm of snow and sleet in Connecticut, bringing drifts of up to of snow in some areas. The storm wrecked the Georges Bank fishing fleet which drowned 81 fishermen and knocked down trees, tore roofs off houses and forced boats to go up on shore. The storm also destroyed a saltworks factory along Cape Cod, sending the economy to a slump. In 1842, a monument was erected to remember the sailors and fishermen lost at sea to the "October Gale" of 1841.

III. In October, a hurricane hit Cuba, crossing near Havana. After crossing the island, it passed by the Florida Keys, bringing them heavy rain but remaining offshore.

I. A major hurricane hit near Portsmouth, North Carolina on July 12. Two ships were capsized, killing their entire crews. It continued across Virginia, dissipating over Maryland.

II. On August 2, a tropical storm hit Northeastern Florida.

III. A second North Carolina hurricane hit Ocracoke, North Carolina on August 24, drowing livestock and washing away homes. In addition, it sank three ships, causing at least 8 deaths.

It continued westward across the Gulf of Mexico, hitting between Matamoros and Tampico, Mexico. Its unusual westward movement, also seen by a hurricane in 1932 and Hurricane Anita in 1977, was due to a strong high pressure system to its north.

V. A strong tropical storm hit Galveston, Texas on September 17. It caused $10,000 in damage, and killed 40 cattle.

VI. A tropical storm hit the Pensacola, Florida area on September 22.

Witch hunt

In a witch hunt people looked for witches or evidence that witchcraft was done. In earlier times, people could be blamed for witchcraft; they were then taken to court, charged with it and punished for it. In the Catholic Church, punishment for witchcraft was death.

Today, most countries no longer allow a person to be blamed for witchcraft; there are no more witch hunts in the strict sense.

When there still were, witch hunts often involved moral panic, mass hysteria and mob lynching. That way, priests would often make a bad feeling in the crowd; those who were a little different might then be seen as witches.

The time when the witch hunts were most common in Europe is during the Early Modern period from about 1480 to 1700. This is the time when there was the Protestant Reformation and the Thirty Years' War. During this time, tens of thousands of people were executed as witches.

Most cultures have reacted to witchcraft in one of two ways:

Today, witch hunts still occur in many communities where religious values are strong, and where these values condemn whichcraft and other occult practices.

Today, the term "witch hunt" is mostly used to refer to similar practices, where worried people look for wrong-doers, which are of course not witches. The best known example is probably the McCarthyist search for communists during the Cold War, which was discredited partly through being compared to the Salem witch trials.

Maula Jatt

Maula Jatt () is one of the most popular movies in the history of Pakistani cinema. It is a Punjabi movie starring legendary actor Sultan Rahi in the lead role and with Aseia and Mustafa Qureshi as the villain Noori Nuth.

"Maula Jutt" was a classic, a movie that scored heavily and reached cult status both in Pakistan & the Republic of India. Such was the impact of the movie that it was copied by movie makers in India and also in Pakistan where several movies with the suffix "Jatt" were made. However, no copy of this movie could ever hope to match the outstanding dialogues in the movie and the chemistry between Sultan Rahi and Mustafa Qureshi.

This movie belongs to a different genre and represents a culture which is so much part of the rural Punjab (Pakistan).

Children in Need

BBC Children in Need is a British charity appeal. It is run by the BBC. It takes place every year in November. The appeal has raised over £500,000,000 since it started in 1980.

Children in Need has been given one evening on BBC One every year since 1980. Events aimed at raising money for charities working with children in the UK were shown. In 2007 over £39 million was raised. £19 million was raised on the programme. In 2008, nearly £22 million was raised on the night. The final total is still to be announced. The BBC also broadcast local fundraising events on the radio stations and regional television channels. The programme's mascot is called 'Pudsey', or 'Pudsey Bear'. It is a yellow teddy bear with a bandage over one eye. It was first seen in 1985. Pudsey and the Children in Need Logo were changed in 2007. Children in Need became a charity in 1989.

Most of the money raised by the appeal comes from people who may have raised it themselves by taking part in sponsored events. A popular event is to sit in a bath of baked beans. Lots of companies also donate money or benefits. In the past, HSBC have helped with banking and BT have helped with the donation call centres and phone lines. On the night of the seven-hour long television programme lots of celebrities appear to support the cause and ask for donations. Various performances are often given, including sketches and musical numbers. There are also featurettes that show what the money is used for. Celebrities that appear are from both the BBC's own programmes, and also from the rival ITV network. They often appear in character and on the sets of their own programmes. One of the most popular features has been a musical number by the BBC newsreaders. In 2006 they had a "James Bond" theme, and in 2008 it was a "Mamma Mia!" one. The stars of newly-opened West End musicals also perform songs from their shows later in the evening, after the 'curtain call' of the actual show performance for that evening. The total is also show on a screen about every hour. The presenters always accompany this with the phrase "every penny counts" to help to push the total beyond that of the previous year.

Most of the British public support Children in Need, but some have a different view. They say that showing children on television as victims, many of which are disabled, is unfortunate and counter-productive. Changes in society will be better for such children than money and sympathy.

Money that is given to Children in Need is used in lots of ways. When the appeal for the year closes, the money is given to organisations that help children that are at the age of 18 and under. The children that are helped often have mental, physical or sensory disabilities, or have behavioural or psychological disorders. Others live in poverty or deprivation, and some are living in distress, are sexually abused or just neglected.

Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?

"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?" is a 1995 song written by Bryan Adams, Michael Kamen and Robert John "Mutt" Lange for the film "Don Juan DeMarco". The melody is used as a musical motif throughout the film, and the song is featured three times in the movie, twice performed by other artists in Spanish, and finally performed by Adams himself during the closing credits. The Adams version of the song, which features flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucia, is featured on the soundtrack album and also on the album "18 Til I Die". It was at number one for five weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, making it the third number one song for the songwriting team, and went on to earn them their second Oscar nomination.

Various women's groups contacted Adams when the song became popular, which led to his publishing a series of books of photos, with all proceeds going to breast cancer research.

Pink Floyd discography

Pink Floyd are an English progressive rock band. Pink Floyd has released twelve studio albums, four live albums, seven compilations, five soundtracks, thirty-five singles, eleven music videos, four video albums and three box sets.

Formed in 1964, Pink Floyd was first known for their psychedelic or space rock music and in later years their progressive rock music. They are known for philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, innovative cover art, and big live shows. One of rock music's most successful acts, the group have sold over 210 million albums worldwide, including 74.5 million albums in the United States alone.

Pink Floyd had moderate mainstream success and were one of the most popular bands in the London underground music scene in the late 1960s led by Syd Barrett; however, Barrett's decline in health would eventually forced his band members to replace him with guitarist and singer David Gilmour. After Barrett left the group Pink Floyd released "Ummagumma". The album was released as a double disc, the first disc contained songs performed live the other disc contained the new studio recorded songs. Singer and bass player Roger Waters gradually became the leader of the band in the mid-1970s, until 1985 when he left the group. The band recorded several albums, achieving worldwide success with "The Dark Side of the Moon" (1973), "Wish You Were Here" (1975), "Animals" (1977), and "The Wall" (1979) with all of them topping the American record chart with the exception of Animals. "The Dark Side of the Moon" is the third best-selling studio album in the world (not counting compilations and various artists soundtracks). In 1985, Waters stated that Pink Floyd was no more, but the remaining members, led by Gilmour, continued recording and touring under the name Pink Floyd. Waters sued the remaining members for the rights to the name, Waters lost and the band enjoyed worldwide success with "A Momentary Lapse of Reason" (1987) and "The Division Bell" (1994).

a These singles would later appear on the Pink Floyd compilation "The Early Singles".

Pahari-Potwari

The Potwari or Pahari-Potwari language (also known as Pothohari or Pothwari; Potwari: پوتوری; Urdu: پوٹھوہاری ) is an Indo-European language spoken in the Potwar district around Rawalpindi, Pakistan to the Cease-fire Line (LoC) of Indian administered Kashmir de-facto border in the Mirpur and Kotli district of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and as well as in Sui Cheemian (Gujar Khan) It is closely related to Punjabi. Dialects include Pahari (Dhundi-Kairali), Pothwari (Potwari), Chibhali, Pindiwali, Punchhi (Poonchi), and Mirpuri.(Mirpuri can also refer to Mirpur Punjabi,{as the people of Mirpur are ethnic Punjabis who had no historic or geographic link to kashmir until the treaty of Amritsar in 1846} a Lahnda language closely related to Western Punjabi.)

There is some dialect continuum with Hindko and the Jhelumi and Mirpuri dialects of Punjabi. Potwari speakers may understand Punjabis both from India and Pakistan, but these groups may not understand Potwari - the reason being that Punjabi is the second-most spoken language in the subcontinent as a whole and in both India and Pakistan respectively whilst Potwari is highly concentrated in the North of Pakistan. Also, Punjab and Kashmir ("the crown" and "jewel", so to speak, of the subcontinent) have always shared strong links on several levels - trade, nobility & neighbourhood.

Every language is a "mongrel" language to some degree or another. Potwari is no different, with the majority of its modern-language roots being connected to Punjabi.

Chris Melling

Chris Melling (b. 21 September 1984, Ashton-in-Makerfield, Greater Manchester) is an English rugby league player. He plays for Harlequins RL in the European Super League.

Chris Melling's position of choice is as a full-back. He can also operate on the wing, in the centres or at hooker. 

Melling is a Great Britain international.

Melling is a former Wigan Senior Academy captain who made several appearance for the Wigan first team.

In Super League 2004 it had seemed that Melling's career was in doubt following a serious knee injury suffered playing for Wigan against Leeds at Headingley. Melling had been seen as a future star before having his season ended by a cruciate ligament injury.

Upon his return to first team action in 2005 Chris made a further 10 first grade appearances for the JJB club before picking up another knee injury requiring further surgery.

Melling returned to full fitness in 2006, but found first team opportunities limited, due to the emergence of Chris Ashton at the club.

Chris Melling moved into the hooking role in Wigan's academy, impressing enough to be voted as the U'21 Academy 'Player of the Year' for 2006.<ref name="League Playing squad 2006/2007"></ref> 

He left Wigan to pursue regular first team football.

Melling was initially signed as a back-up hooker to Chad Randall, however the Great Britain international has made full back position his own. He has been compared to Wade McKinnon with the youngster being defensively solid and dependable, with an eye for a gap bringing the ball out in attack. 

His move to Harlequins RL was to have seen the youngster undergo a positional change with a move to hooker. He had been previously employed throughout the backline, with most of his first team appearances coming as an outside back.

Melling has impressed in 2007, starting games at full-back and throughout the backline and scoring four tries.

In May 2007 Chris Melling agreed to a new two-year deal with Harlequins Rugby League, midway through his first season at the Twickenham Stoop. This will keep Melling in the capital until 2009.

He is seen as the emerging star at the London club, with Harlequins RL investing in young British talent.

In June 2007 Melling was called up to the Great Britain squad and wore the number 1 shirt in the Test match against France. 

Melling was joined in the Great Britain Test side by Quins teammate Paul Sykes. 

Melling made his Great Britain debut in the 42-14 victory over the French on June 22nd 2007, despite carrying an injury.

Melling is also a youth level international for England.

Melling is a qualified Physiotherapist after studying at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, graduating in June 2006. Melling hopes to set up his own physiotherapy practise in the future.

Responsible government

Responsible government is a principle of some democratic governments. It has nothing to do with the question of whether a government has responsibility.

In the government of a country that uses responsible government, the leaders of the executive branch of government (called the cabinet) are also members of the legislature. Also, the cabinet must have the support of the majority of the legislature to stay in power. If it loses the support of the legislature, there will be an election or a different political party will make a new cabinet.

Countries that use responsible government usually have parliamentary systems of government. Some examples of countries that have responsible government are the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.

In countries that do not have responsible government, the cabinet and the legislature are each elected separately. This system has more separation of powers than a system with responsible government. Some examples of countries that "do not" have a system of responsible government are the United States and France.

Trang

Trang
is the one of the southern province of Thailand.
In the past, Trang's name was Ta-Rang because Ta-Rang is the name from Malaysia, but Thai people did not like to say Ta-Rang, because it's too long so they mixed it into 1 syllable called Trang. Trang used to be a port involved in foreign trade. It was also the port of transportation. Trang is connecting with Nakornsritammaraj Province. Trang was the first city where rubber trees were planted. Governor Phraya Ratsadanupradit Mahison Phakdi brought rubber from Malaysia and planted it here before anywhere else in southern Thailand in 1899. Rubber is now consider an important product of Thailand. The important Rivers that flows through the province, there are Trang River and Palian River. The rivers flow between the Khao Luang mountain range and the Banthat mountain range. The province has an area about 5,000 square km. It is located on the Andaman Sea, and contains 46 islands together with the mainland area. The most of the area is hills. Trang is the good place at southern to travel. The best time for sea travel is during October to May because another time is raining. When the raining come it will has the storm.

The Piper at the Gates of Dawn

The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is Pink Floyd's first album. Many people think it is one of the most influential albums in history. It had a very big influence on the psychedelic rock scene of the time, and also on the music that people made afterward. It is the only Pink Floyd album with Syd Barrett as the leader, although Barrett was on some of the next album, "A Saucerful of Secrets".

The lyrics for "Piper" were mostly written by Syd Barrett, and are often whimsical, playful, or childlike. The album has songs about space, scarecrows, gnomes, bicycles and fairytales. Some parts of the album, like "Interstellar Overdrive", are instrumental and have no singing on them.

Special limited editions of "Piper" were released to mark its 30th anniversary in 1997, and its 40th anniversary in 2007.

All songs written by Syd Barrett, except where noted.

Less than two months after the launch of the Simple English Wikipedia's Did You Know section, another new project has been launched - The Simple English Wikipedia Wikicup.

The aim of the Wikicup is to make editing more fun and also reward editors for their time dedicated to building the encyclopedia for the benefit of others.

The idea for the cup was first throught up by in September 2008, but unfortunately it was underused and underdeveloped before eventually being cancelled. But, it was not forgotten!

It now has 16 competitors, and we watch with interest how these users are split up when the pools are released at the end of December. We also watch with more interest what happens once the Cup begins!

Good luck to everyone competing, and if you haven't yet , then why not?!?!

Finally, I hope that everyone has a good Christmas and New Year, and that you all have a good Christmas break.

Israeli-Palestinian conflict

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a fight that is still going on between the State of Israel and the Palestinians. It forms part of the wider Arab–Israeli conflict. Essentially, it is a dispute between two groups of people with claims over the same area of land. Many attempts have been made to make a two-state solution, which would create an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. At present, the vast majority of Israelis and Palestinians, according to many major polls, agree a two-state solution is the best way to end the conflict. Most Palestinians view the West Bank and Gaza Strip as constituting the area of their future state, which is a view also accepted by most Israelis. A handful of academics advocate a one-state solution, whereby all of Israel, the Gaza Strip, and West Bank would become a bi-national state with equal rights for all. However, there are significant areas of disagreement over the shape of any final agreement and also regarding the level of credibility each side sees in the other in upholding basic commitments.

The long-playing record is an analog format. The digital recording of sound was only made practical by the technical advances in microprocessors and computing which occurred in the 1970s and 1980s.

Space rock is a subgenre of rock music. The term originally referred to a group of early mostly British 1970s progressive rock and psychedelic bands such as Hawkwind and Pink Floyd. The music is characterised by slow, lengthy instrumental passages dominated by synthesisers, experimental guitar work and science fiction lyrical themes. Later the words were changed to mean a series of late 1980s British alternative rock bands that drew from earlier influences to create a more melodic but still ambient form of pop music.

The Final Cut (album)

The Final Cut is a rock album by Pink Floyd. It was recorded at various studios in the UK from July to December 1982. It is the final Pink Floyd studio album with the band's bassist and primary songwriter Roger Waters.

The album is predominantly the work of Waters. It is the only Pink Floyd album on which the credit for writing every song is given to Waters alone. Keyboardist Rick Wright had been fired by Waters during the recording of "The Wall", so this is the only Pink Floyd album on which Wright does not participate at all. Meanwhile, David Gilmour sings lead vocals on only one of the album's twelve songs, the rest being sung entirely by Waters.

During the recording of "The Final Cut", there was a lot of tension between Waters and the other members of the band, particularly Gilmour, who now says that he doesn't like most of the album. For these and other reasons, it is sometimes regarded as a Roger Waters solo album rather than a true Pink Floyd album.

None of the album's songs has ever been performed live by Pink Floyd, though some have been performed live by Waters during solo tours. Waters' dominance on the album is most clearly seen on the back cover, which reads: "The Final Cut: A Requiem for the Post-War Dream - by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd".

All songs composed by Roger Waters. All lead vocals performed by Roger Waters unless otherwise stated.

Two things should be noted here: It was their first album on their record label Capitol Records. It was also the last CD which Brian Pitman (Relient k bassist) recorded with the band.

The album was released again, with a new song which was first found on an EP. In 2005, the album was given gold status, because it had sold half a million copies in America. The album had a few singles which were played only on Christian radio such as High of 75 and I so hate consequences

The singer of this song and the band named Matt Thiessen said himself that the song was inspired by the weather in Ohio they couldn't depend on the changing of it.

It might be represented by the music, because sometimes it's urgent and fast then it goes slow and calm, reflecting the weather. Tempo changes were used in a similar way for the Sum 41 song We're all to blame

Aboriginal art is a type of art native to the Australian Aboriginals. Traditional Aboriginal art was inspired by religious ceremonies or rituals.

Aboriginal art is an important part of the world's oldest continuous cultural tradition. It is also one of the most exciting areas of art. It is based on animals or patterns. All the designs, painted or drawn, have a story behind them.

Symbols are used in Aboriginal art, to show the presence of different things. For example, a 'U' shape is the symbol for a man. Aboriginal art is a language in itself, communicating through beautiful patterns. This started around 30,000 to 40,000 years ago.

Some Aboriginal artists sell their artwork for a lot of money. In 2007 Pitjantjatjara artist Yannima Pikarli Tommy Watson sold a painting for AU$240,000.

In 2010 the Queensland Government said that it would have the first two Tilt Trains painted by indigenous artists Judy Watson and Alick Tipoti. With seven carriages and two locomotives, the trains will be 185 metres long, making them the biggest modern aboriginal art piece. The Tilt Trains will run between Brisbane and Cairns.

The paintings are usually used with dark, earthy colours like brown, orange, red, etc.

Spontaneous generation

The theory known as spontaneous generation held that complex, living organisms are generated by decaying organic substances. Mice might spontaneously appear in stored grain or maggots could spontaneously appear in meat.

According to Aristotle it was a readily observable truth that aphids arise from the dew which falls on plants, fleas from putrid matter, mice from dirty hay, crocodiles from logs rotting at the bottom of bodies of water, and se same timo forth. In the 17th century these things started to be questioned.
Sir Thomas Browne wrote a book called "Pseudodoxia Epidemica". He subtitled it "Enquiries into Very many Received Tenets, and Commonly Presumed Truths". He published it in 1646. He wrote it as an attack on "false beliefs and "vulgar errors"". Scientists failed to accept the conclusions he reached. That way, Alexander Ross, a scientist who lived at the same time as Browne, wrote about it: "To question this he meant: spontaneous generation) is to question reason, sense and experience. If he doubts of this let him go to Egypt, and there he will find the fields swarming with mice, begot of the mud of Nylus, to the great calamity of the inhabitants."

In 1546 the physician Girolamo Fracastoro theorized that epidemic diseases were caused by tiny, invisible particles or "spores", which might not be living creatures, but this was not widely accepted. Next, Robert Hooke published the first drawings of a microorganism in 1665. He is also credited for naming the cell which he discovered while observing cork samples.

In 1676, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek discovered microorganisms that were probably protozoa and bacteria. This sparked new interest in the microscopic world. 

The first step was taken by the Italian Francesco Redi. In 1668, Redi proved that no maggots appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs. From the 17th century onwards it was gradually shown that, at least in the case of all the higher and readily visible organisms, the previous sentiment regarding spontaneous generation was false. The alternative seemed to be omne vivum ex ovo: that every living thing came from a pre-existing living thing (literally, everything from an egg). 

In 1768 Lazzaro Spallanzani proved that microbes came from the air, and could be killed by boiling. Yet it was not until 1861 that Louis Pasteur performed a series of careful experiments. With these experiments, Pasteur proved that organisms such as bacteria and fungi do not appear in nutrient-rich media of their own accord in non-living material. This experiment supported cell theory.

Wallabies are marsupials from the islands of Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand and New Guinea. They are small- to medium-sized kangaroos. There are 30 different types of wallabies that live in many types of habitats, including rocky areas, grasslands, forests and swamps.

Wallabies range in size from the size of a rabbit to almost 6 ft (1.8 m) long. The soft, woolly fur can be gray, brown, red or almost black. The belly is lighter. Females (called fliers) have a pouch in which the young live and drink milk. Males (called boomers) are larger than females. Babies are called joeys. They have short arms with clawed fingers. strong, legs, and long, four-toed feet with claws. They can hop and jump with their powerful legs. 

These herbivores (plant-eaters) eat grass, leaves, and roots. They swallow their food without chewing it and later regurgitate a cud and chew it. They need very little water; they can go for months without drinking, and they dig their own water wells. 

This is a list of about 30 wallaby species:

John Vane (bushranger)

John Vane was an Australian bushranger who became a member of Ben Hall's gang. He was one of the few members of the gang to die of old age, and not to be killed.

John Vane was born at Jerry Plains, near Singleton, New South Wales on 28 June 1842. His grandparents had come to Australia as convicts but his father and mother were seen as respectable and wealthy. They lived at Kelso, near Bathurst before moving to Jerry Plains in about 1841. When John was about six years old the family moved back to Kelso and then onto Teasdale Park (Carcoar), near Hobbys Yards. Teasdale Park was owned by George Chesher (Cheshire) who would become Vane's father-in-law. The Vane family moved to Kempfield, near the Abercrombie caves where they stayed for a number of years. John worked as a shepherd and the money he was paid helped his father buy land, probably their Wattle Grove home.

1850 John Vane and his brother William (Billy) went to work at James Hanrahan's Wentworth Gully Station near the Weddin Mountains. It is not apparent if the entire family went or just the two boys. Billy taught John to ride horses while at Hanrahan's. They stayed there for about a year and returned to the Kempfield district. 

John was 14 years when sent to Bathurst and apprenticed to a blacksmith and wheelwright named McDonald. He then went on to the Turon goldfields where he saved a fair sum before it was stolen from him. He would then drive a bullock team between Orange and Lambing Flat (Young).

He was described in 1863 as being about six feet tall, with dark hair and a ruddy complexion.. He worked as a stockman, looking after cattle and was said to be an excellent horse rider.

On Christmas eve of 1862 John Vane, Billy Vane, George Chesher Jnr, James Burke and John McKellar were at Boyce's public house at Long Swamp near Trunkey Creek. Warrents were issued for the five youth for robbery of the publican. John Vane hid in the bush and eluded capture until his surrender later that year. The others were captured by police and eventually dismissed due to lack of evidence [1863 NSW Police Gazette].

John Vane and his good mate Micky Burke had built a reputation for providing locals with stolen beef and horses. This quality spread among he criminal elements of surrounding districts. In July 1863 members of the Hall gang were seeking fresh horses and new districts to plunder. John Gilbert and John O'Meally came to the Carcoar district and sent out word that Vane's local expertise was required. The pair met with Vane at his camp at Millpost Creek and laid plans for an attack on the Carcoar bank. On 30 July 1863 that plan was put into action. Vane had provided logistics for the raid, though he did not participate. Gilbert and O'Meally would ride into town and perform the first daylight bank robbery in the colony. Vane would now fall in with the gang and soon after so would his mate Micky Burke.

Ben Hall would soon join the other members of the gang and have a spree around the district. They bailed up storeowners and gold buyers. They held the town of Canowindra and all its inhabitants for three days. They tied the pursuing troopers to trees and took their uniforms and weapons. They raided the town of Bathurst and sent the colonial administrators into turmoil. 

The excitiment and adventure came to a tragic end when on the afternoon of 24 October 1863, the gang went to the home of Gold Commissioner Henry Keightley at Dunn's Plains, near Rockley. Home at the time were Mrs Keightley, house staff and Dr Pechey. During the gun battle Vane's mate Micky Burke was shot in the stomach, and through fear of being caught by police decided to shoot himself. There is still debate today around who actually shot Burke. Vane was enraged and wanted to kill Keightley in revenge. It was decided though that the ransom Keightley would receive for killing Burke (₤500)should be sought by the gang. Keightley's wife and Dr Pechey rode to Bathurst that night to get the money from Mrs Keightley's father, Henry Rotton.. Pechey and Rotton returned the next morning and the money was handed to Gilbert. Keightley was immediately released. The story of the ride was later turned into a stage play.

In November 1863 a priest, Father Tim M'Carthy met Vane by chance in the bush. He later met the bushranger's mother. They talked Vane into giving himself up. He went with the priest to Nathaniel Connolly's home who supplied them with a letter to secure Vane's passage to Bathurst courthouse. Vane was sentenced to 15 years at Darlinghurst and released after six for good behavior.

He drove the mail coach between Carcoar and Mt Donald until retiring. Vane continued to be in trouble with the police. In 1880 the newspapers reported that John Vane, ex-bushranger, was in court at Bathurst, for stealing 431 sheep. A friend, Terence M'Cann who had helped steal the sheep, was the main witness. John Vane's brother-in-law, Thomas Parker, tried to stop M'Cann from giving evidence. He was put in gaol for 12 months.

Well, Simple News "Edition 1" was a relative success. There were a few issues with formatting and the method of delivery which have now been sorted out, so the next issues will be perfect!

I am writing this with weeks to go before delivery of the next edition of Simple News, and I can't wait. Its all very exciting. Currently there are 23 people who want this monthly delivery, and a good number of contributors who want to get involved. 

With this delivery of "Edition 2", I will be proposing that Simple News is relocated to a new home in the Wikipedia: namespace to really get more people to help out.

There will be many new features coming soon. I will interview even more editors for the QandA, some articles written by new users, and some other stuff!

Look out soon for an even more information-packed newsletter in the new year!

WOW! after only one edition, Simple News already has its own spin-off newsletter. Over at Simple.Wikiquote, you can find a similar news page. While I don't want to complain, and be accused of , I do feel that they could have made an effort instead of just copying all the code that our editors here have worked on. It is an exact copy of "Simple News", only with the name changed. Anyway, with a smaller userbase and less activity, lets watch with anticipation at how successful it will be compared to Simple News. 

Finally, because this is the last edition of Simple News before the Christmas break, I would like to take this oppertunity to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! 

Remember everyone, you need to sing Auld Lang Syne! See you next year!

<doc id="141778" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=141778" title="Cloud computing">
Cloud computing

In Computer science, Cloud computing is a marketing term. In the case of electricity, users can simply use it. They do not need to worry where the electricity is from, how it is generated, or transported. At the end of the month, they will get a bill for the amount of electricity they consumed.

The idea behind cloud computing is similar: The user can simply use storage, computing power, or specially crafted development environments, without having to worry how these work internally. Cloud computing is a systems architecture model for Internet-based computing. It is the development and use of computer technology on the Internet. The "cloud" is a metaphor for the Internet based on how the internet is described in computer network diagrams; which means it is an abstraction hiding the complex infrastructure of the internet. It is a style of computing in which IT-related capabilities are provided “as a service”, allowing users to access technology-enabled services from the Internet ("in the cloud") without knowledge of, or control over the technologies behind these servers. 

According to a paper published by "IEEE Internet Computing" in 2008 "Cloud Computing is a paradigm in which information is permanently stored in servers on the Internet and cached temporarily on clients that include computers, laptops, handhelds, sensors, etc."

Cloud computing is a general concept that utilizes software as a service (SaaS), such as Web 2.0 and other technology trends, all of which depend on the Internet for satisfying users' needs. For example, Google Apps provides common business applications online that are accessed from a web browser, while the software and data are stored on the Internet servers. 

Cloud computing is often confused with grid computing ("a form of distributed computing whereby a "super and virtual computer" is composed of a cluster of networked, loosely-coupled computers, working together to perform very large tasks"), utility computing (the "packaging of computing resources, such as computation and storage are provided as a measured service that have to be paid similar to a traditional public utility such as electricity") and autonomic computing ("computer systems capable of self-management"). 

Many cloud computing deployments are today powered by grids, have autonomic characteristics and are billed like utilities, but cloud computing can be seen as a "natural next step" from the "grid-utility model". Some successful cloud architectures have little or no centralised infrastructure or billing systems at all including peer-to-peer networks like BitTorrent and Skype.

The majority of cloud computing infrastructure currently consists of reliable services delivered through data centers that are built on computer and storage virtualization technologies. The services are accessible anywhere in the world, with "The Cloud" appearing as a single point of access for all the computing needs of consumers. Commercial offerings need to meet the quality of service requirements of customers and typically offer service level agreements. Open standards and open source software are also critical to the growth of cloud computing.

As customers generally do not own the infrastructure or know all details about it, mainly they are accessing or renting, so they can consume resources as a service, and may be paying for what they do not need, instead of what they actually do need to use. Many cloud computing providers have adopted the utility computing model which is analogous to how traditional public utilities like electricity are consumed, while others are billed on a subscription basis. By sharing consumable and ""intangible"" computing power between multiple ""tenants"", utilization rates can be improved (as servers are not left idle) which can reduce costs significantly while increasing the speed of application development. A side effect of this approach is that "computer capacity rises dramatically" as customers do not have to engineer for peak loads. Adoption has been enabled by "increased high-speed bandwidth" which makes it possible to receive the same response times from centralized infrastructure at other sites.

Cloud computing is being driven by providers including Google, Amazon.com, and Yahoo! as well as traditional vendors including IBM, Intel, Microsoft and SAP. It is adopted from individual users through large enterprises as General Electric..

"The Cloud" is a metaphor for the Internet, or more generally components and services which are managed by others.

The underlying concept dates back to 1960 when John McCarthy expressed his opinion that "computation may someday be organized as a public utility" and the term "Cloud" was already in commercial use in the early 1990s to refer to large ATM networks. By the turn of the 21st century, cloud computing solutions had started to appear on the market, though most of the focus at this time was on Software as a service.

Amazon.com played a key role in the development of cloud computing when upgrading their data centers after the dot-com bubble and providing access to their systems by way of Amazon Web Services in 2002 on a utility computing basis. They found the new cloud architecture resulted in significant internal efficiency improvements.

2007 observed increased activity, including Google, IBM and a number of universities starting large scale "cloud computing" research project, around the time the term started gaining popularity in the mainstream press. It was a hot topic by mid-2008 and numerous cloud computing events had been scheduled.

In August 2008 Gartner observed that "organisations are switching from company-owned hardware and software assets to per-use service-based models" and that the "projected shift to cloud computing will result in dramatic growth in IT products in some areas and in significant reductions in other areas".

"Clouds" cross many countries borders and "may be the ultimate form of globalisation". As such it is the subject of complex geopolitical issues, whereby providers must satisfy many legal restrictions in order to deliver service to a global market. This dates back to the early days of the Internet, where libertarian thinkers felt that "cyberspace was a distinct place calling for laws and legal institutions of its own"; author Neal Stephenson envisaged this as a tiny island data haven called Kinakuta in his science-fiction classic novel Cryptonomicon.

Although there have been efforts to match the legal environment (such as US-EU Safe Harbor), providers like Amazon Web Services are currently dealing with international markets (typically the United States and European Union) by deploying local infrastructure and allowing customers to select their countries. However there are still concerns about security and privacy from individual through governmental level, (for example the USA PATRIOT Act and use of national security letters and title II of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Stored Communications Act).

In March 2007, Dell applied to trademark the term '"cloud computing" in the United States. It received a "Notice of Allowance" in July 2008 which was subsequently canceled on August 6, resulting in a formal rejection of the trademark application in less than a week later.

In November 2007, the Free Software Foundation released the Affero General Public License (abbreviated as Affero GPL and AGPL), a version of GPLv3 designed to close a perceived legal loophole associated with Free software designed to be run over a network, particularly software as a service. According to the AGPL license application service providers are required to release any changes they make to an AGPL open source code.

"Cloud architecture" is the systems architecture of the software systems involved in the delivery of "cloud computing" (eg hardware, software) as designed by a "cloud architect" who typically works for a "cloud integrator". It typically involves multiple "cloud components" communicating with each other over application programming interfaces (usually web services).

This is very similar to the Unix philosophy of having multiple programs doing one thing well and working together over universal interfaces. Complexity is controlled and the resulting systems are more manageable than their monolithic counterparts.

"Cloud architecture" extends to the client where web browsers and/or software applications are used to access "cloud applications".

"Cloud storage architecture" is loosely coupled where metadata operations are centralized enabling the data nodes to scale into the hundreds, each independently delivering data to applications or users.


A "cloud application" influences The Cloud model of software architecture, often eliminating the need to install and run the application on the customer's own computer, thus reducing software maintenance, ongoing operations, and support. For example:

A "cloud client" is computer hardware and/or computer software which relies on The Cloud for application delivery, or which is specifically designed for delivery of cloud services, and which is in either case essentially useless without a Cloud. For example:

"Cloud infrastructure" (e.g. Infrastructure as a service) is the delivery of computer infrastructure (typically a platform virtualization environment) as a service. For example:

A "cloud platform" (eg Platform as a service) (the delivery of a computing platform and/or solution stack as a service) facilitates deployment of applications without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers. For example:

A "cloud service" (eg Web Service) is "software system[s] designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network" which may be accessed by other cloud computing components, software (eg Software plus services) or end users directly. For example:

"Cloud storage" is the delivery of data storage as a service (including database-like services), often billed on a utility computing basis (eg per gigabyte per month). For example:


Traditional storage vendors have recently begun to offer their own flavor of cloud storage, sometimes in conjunction with their existing software products (e.g. Symantec's Online Storage for Backup Exec). Others focus on providing a new kind of back-end storage optimally designed for delivering cloud storage (EMC's Atmos), categorically known as Cloud Optimized Storage.

A "cloud computing provider" or "cloud computing service provider" owns and operates "cloud computing" systems to deliver service to third parties. Usually this requires significant resources and expertise in building and managing the next generation of data centers. Some organisations are realising a subset of the benefits of cloud computing by becoming "internal" cloud providers and servicing themselves, though they do not benefit from the same economies of scale and still have to engineer for peak loads. The barrier to entry is also significantly higher with capital expenditure required and billing and management creates some overhead. However, significant operational efficiency and quickness advantages can be achieved even by small organisations and server consolidation and virtualization rollouts are already in progress. Amazon.com was the first such provider, modernising its data centers which, like most computer networks were using as little as 10% of its capacity at any one time just to leave room for occasional spikes. This allowed small, fast-moving groups to add new features faster and easier, and they went on to open it up to outsiders as Amazon Web Services in 2002 on a utility computing basis.

The companies listed in the "Components" section are providers.

A user is a consumer of "cloud computing". The privacy of users in cloud computing has become of increasing concern. The rights of users is also an issue, which is being addressed via a community effort to create a bill of rights (currently in draft).

A vendor sells products and services that facilitate the delivery, adoption and use of "cloud computing". For example:


A "cloud standard" is one of a number of existing (typically lightweight) open standards that have facilitated the growth of cloud computing, including:

Avant-garde music

Avant-garde music, or experimental music, is a type of music that is meant to push the boundaries of "what music is." It started in the 1940s and 1950s after World War II. Some famous avant-garde composers were John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Henry Cowell.

This was a song written by John Cage that is 4 minutes and 33 seconds of complete silence. It is meant to make the audience listen to the sounds around them.

This is a song by the popular English rock band The Beatles. It appeared on their album "The Beatles", also known as "The White Album" (released in 1968.) "Revolution 9" is over 8 minutes of random sounds, and someone repeatedly saying "number 9...number 9...number 9...number 9..." It was mostly the work of John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono.

This is a song by the American grunge band Pearl Jam. It is the last song on their third album "Vitalogy", released in 1994. It is over seven minutes long. It is made up of conversations between mental patients in asylums, and psychiatrists, with distorted bass guitar and drums laid over them.

Allspice

Allspice (also called Jamaica pepper, Kurundu, Myrtle pepper, pimento, allspice berries, or newspice) is a spice which is the dried unripe fruit of the "Pimenta dioica" plant, a tree native to the West Indies, southern Mexico and Central America. The tree Pimenta diocia is from the myrtle family (Myrtaceae), and it is very valued for its berries. The allspice was named because the flavor of the berry is like a mixture of cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg. It is used very much in baking, mostly for making mincemeat and mixed pickling spice. It was discovered first by the early Spanish explorers, who mistook it for a type of pepper.

Allspice is the only spice grown in the Western Hemisphere. But after that, the wild trees were cut down to get the berries and only a few allspice are left. There are many plantations in Mexico and Central America, too. However, the best allspice comes from Jamaica where the weather and soil are best for the berries.

Allspice was used by the Mayans and by other South American Indians when making chocolate. The name "Jamaica" comes from Xamayca. This means ‘land of wood and water’ in the language of the Arawaks. The Arawaks used allspice to help keep the meat from rotting, or sometimes against their enemies.

The spice was imported to Europe after it was discovered. There were many tries to plant it in the East, but it did not work because the trees could not give a lot of fruit. Even though it had a rich smell and a tasty flavor, allspice never had the same caché in Europe as cinnamon or pepper. The English started taking the spice by ship to England in 1737, but by that time the want for spices had been taken over by other kinds of products such as sugar and coffee. It was still a little popular in England though, where it came to be known as the "English Spice".
In the Napoleonic war of 1812, Russian soldiers put the spice in their boots to keep their feet warm. Because of this, today the pimento oil from the allspice is usually used for the men’s dress.

Dried allspice berries look like large brown peppercorns and their colors are cocoa brown. When the berries are not yet ripe, they are harvested and dried by the sun. They are different in size from between 4 to 7 mm (1/8 - 1/4 in) in diameter and are dark brown. Their skin is very wrinkled, and the outer case has two seeds. Allspice can be eaten ground or whole.

Whole dried allspice can keep without a time limit if they are properly kept in airtight jars. They also must not face the light. It can be ground in a mill or an electric coffee grinder. After it is ground, the spice loses its flavor in a few days.

The Host is a 2008 science-fiction/romance book by Stephenie Meyer. A movie based on the book is currently in development. 

Melanie Stryder refuses to fade away. The earth has been invaded by a species that takes over the minds of their human hosts while leaving their bodies intact, and most of humanity has succumbed.

Wanderer, the invading ‘soul’ who has been given Melanie’s body, knew about the challenges of living inside a human: the overwhelming emotions, the too-vivid memories. But there was one difficulty Wanderer didn’t expect: the former tenant of her body refusing to relinquish possession of her mind.

Melanie fills Wanderer’s thoughts with visions of the man Melanie loves – Jared, a human who still lives in hiding. Unable to separate herself from her body’s desires, Wanderer yearns for a man she’s never met. As outside forces make Wanderer and Melanie unwilling allies, they set off to search for the man they both love.

Morse code is a type of code that is used to send telegraphic information using rhythm. Morse code uses "dots" and "dashes" to show the alphabet letters, numbers, punctuation and special characters of a given message. When messages are sent through Morse code, dots are short clicks and dashes are longer clicks.

Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, who helped invent it. It is not used as much today as it was in the 19th and 20th centuries, because there are now other types of technology that are easier to use to communicate. However, some people still use Morse code to communicate on "amateur radios", which are also called "ham radios". Many people do this as a hobby.

Komodo dragon

The Komodo dragon ("Varanus komodoensis") is a species of lizard that lives in the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rincah, Flores, Gili Motang, and Gili Dasami. It is the largest living kind of lizard. They grow to an average length of 2–3 meters (approximately 6.5–10 ft) and weigh around 70kg (154 pounds). Komodo dragon bites can be very dangerous, and they sometimes attack people. 

Western scientists first saw Komodo dragons in 1910. They are very popular animals in zoos because they are very big and look scary. The lizards are in some danger. There are very few Komodo dragons still alive on their home islands. Indonesian law does not allow hunting these lizards. Komodo National Park was made to help protect Komodo dragons.

The Komodo dragon has other names. It can also be called the Komodo Monitor or the Komodo Island Monitor by some scientists, but this is not very common. The people who live in Komodo Island call them "ora", "buaja durat" (land crocodile) or "biawak raksasa" (giant monitor).

The Komodo dragon is cold-blooded. It has a tail as long as its body. It has about 60 sharp teeth that can grow up to 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) long. It also has a long, yellow, forked tongue. Its saliva is red because its gums almost completely cover its teeth. When they eat, their teeth cut their gums and make them bleed. This creates a good environment for the dangerous bacteria that live in its mouth. 

These lizards are the top predators in the areas where they live, because they are so big.
People used to think they were very big because there are no other large, meat-eating animals on the islands where they live. Therefore they did not have to compete with other similar animals for the same food and places to live. People also thought they were big because of their low metabolic rate. 

However, facts are different. The fossil record shows that the Komodo is the last of a group of lizards called varanids. These lizards have been about the same size for nearly a million years. They had their origin in Australia nearly four million years ago, and spread later to much of Indonesia. Their size has nothing to do with being on a relatively small island.

Most of them died out after contact with modern humans.

The Komodo dragon's earholes are easy to see, but Komodo dragons are not very good at hearing. It is able to see as far away as 300 meters (985 feet), but it is thought to have poor night vision. The Komodo dragon is able to see in color, but has trouble seeing objects that do not move. 

The Komodo dragon uses its tongue to taste and smell like many other reptiles. They have a special part of the body called the Jacobson's organ for smelling. With the help of a good wind, they can smell dead animals from 4–9.5 kilometres (2.5–6 mi) away. The Komodo dragon's nostrils are not very useful for smelling, because it does not have a diaphragm. It only has a few taste buds in the back of its throat. Its scales have special connections to nerves that give the lizard a sense of touch. The scales around its ears, lips, chin, and bottoms of the feet may have three or more of these connections.

Komodo dragons have dangerous bacteria in their saliva. Scientists have identified 57 of them. One of the most dangerous bacteria in Komodo dragon saliva appears to be a kind of "Pasteurella multocida". These bacteria cause disease in the blood of their victim. If a bite does not kill an animal and it escapes, it will usually die within a week from infection. The Komodo dragon seems to never get sick from its own bacteria. So, researchers have been looking for the lizard's antibacterial. This may be used as medicine for humans.

Mating begins between May and August, and the eggs are laid in September. Dragons leave about twenty eggs in empty nests left by birds called megapodes. The eggs develop for seven to eight months. The eggs open and the baby lizards come out in April, when there are many insects to eat. Young Komodo dragons live in trees, where they are safe from adult Komodo dragons and other animals that might eat them. They take around three to five years to mature and may live as long as fifty years. Female Komodo dragons can have babies without fertilisation (parthenogenesis).

The Komodo dragon likes hot and dry places and lives in dry open grassland, savanna, and tropical forest on lower land. It is most active in the day because it is cold-blooded, although it is sometimes active at night. Komodo dragons live alone. They come together only to breed and eat. They can run up to 20 kilometers per hour (12.4 mph), dive up to 4.5 metres (15 ft) at top speed for short periods of time. When they are young, they climb trees with their strong claws. As the Komodo dragon grows bigger, its claws are used mostly as weapons, because it is too big to climb trees well. 

The Komodo dragon digs holes for protection with its powerful legs and claws. These holes can be from 1–3 metres (3–10 ft) wide.
Because it is very big and sleeps in holes, it is able to keep itself warm through the night. The Komodo dragon usually hunts in the afternoon, but stays in the shade during the hottest part of the day. Komodo dragons have special resting places on ridges that catch cool sea breezes.

Komodo dragons are carnivores, which means that they eat meat. Although they eat mostly dead animals they will also catch live animals as prey. When prey goes by a Komodo dragon, it will suddenly charge at the animal and bite or claw the belly or the throat. To catch animals that are up high and out of reach, the Komodo dragon may stand on its back legs and use its tail as a support.

Komodo dragons do not chew their food. They eat by biting and pulling off large chunks of flesh and swallowing them whole. They can swallow smaller prey, up to the size of a goat, whole. This is because they have flexible jaws and skulls, and their stomachs can expand. Komodo dragons make much saliva to help the food move easily, but swallowing still takes a long time (15–20 minutes to swallow a goat). Komodo dragons may try to swallow faster by running and pushing the dead animal in its mouth very hard against a tree. Sometimes a lizard hits the tree so hard that it gets knocked out. Dragons breath using a small tube under the tongue that connects to the lungs. This allows it to continue breathing even while swallowing large things. Komodo dragons can eat up to 80 percent of its body weight in one meal. After swallowing its food, it drags itself to a sunny place to speed up digestion so the food does not rot and poison the dragon. Large dragons can survive on as little as 12 meals a year. After digestion, the Komodo dragon vomits the horns, hair, and teeth of the animal it ate. This vomit is covered in a smelly mucus. After vomiting, it rubs its face in the dirt or on bushes to get rid of the mucus. This suggests that komodo dragons dislike the smell, just like humans do.

The largest animals usually eat first, while the smaller ones eat later. Dragons of equal size may wrestle each other. Losers usually run away, although sometimes they are chased and eaten by the winners.

The Komodo dragon's diet includes invertebrates, other reptiles (including smaller Komodo dragons), birds, bird eggs, small mammals, monkeys, wild boars, goats, deer, horses, and water buffalo. Young Komodo dragons will eat insects, eggs, geckoes, and small mammals. Komodo dragons may eat people and, they can even dig up bodies from their graves to eat them. Therefore, people on Komodo Island moved their graves from sandy to clay ground and piled rocks on top to stop the lizards from digging up dead bodies.

Because the Komodo dragon does not have a diaphragm, it cannot suck water when drinking. It cannot lap water with its tongue either. Instead, it drinks by taking a mouthful of water, lifting its head, and letting the water run down its throat.

Recent fossils from Queensland suggests that the Komodo dragon evolved in Australia before spreading to Indonesia. Its body size remained stable on Flores, ever since the islands were isolated by rising sea levels, about 900,000 years ago. The sea level dropped very low during the last ice age and uncovered wide areas of continental shelf. The Komodo dragon spread into these areas. They became isolated on the islands where they live today when sea levels rose again. They moved into what is now the Indonesian island group. They spread as far east as the island of Timor. 

Komodo dragons have been popular in zoos for a long time. However, there are few of them in zoos because they may become sick and do not have babies easily. As of May 2009, there are 13 European, 2 African, 35 North American, 1 Singaporean, and 2 Australian institutions that keep Komodo dragons.

A Komodo dragon was shown in a zoo for the first time in 1934 at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. But, it lived for only two years. People continued to try to keep Komodo dragons in zoos, but the lives of these creatures was very short. The average life of a dragon in a zoo was five years in the National Zoological Park. Walter Auffenberg studied the dragons in zoos and eventually helped zoos to keep dragons more successfully

Many dragons in zoos may become tamer than wild lizards within a short period of time in a zoo. Many zoo keepers have brought the animals out of their cages to meet visitors without any problems. Dragons can also recognize individual humans. However, even dragons that seem tame may surprise people and become aggressive. This can often happen when a stranger enters the animal's home. 

Research with captive Komodo dragons has shown that they play. One dragon would push a shovel left and seemed attracted to the sound of it moving across rocks. A young female dragon at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. would grab and shake things like statues, drink cans, plastic rings, and blankets. She would also put her head in boxes, shoes, and other objects. She did not make a mistake and think these objects were food; she would only swallow them if they were covered in rat blood.

Komodo dragons do not attack human very often. However, they do sometimes hurt or kill people.

In June 2001, a Komodo dragon seriously hurt Phil Bronstein—executive editor of the "San Francisco Chronicle". Bronstein had entered the dragon's cage at the Los Angeles Zoo after being invited in by its keeper. The zoo keeper had told him to take off his white shoes, which could have excited the Komodo dragon. Bronstein was bitten on his bare foot. Although he escaped, he needed surgery to repair his foot.

On June 4, 2007, a Komodo dragon attacked an eight-year-old boy on Komodo Island. The boy later died because he lost too much blood. This was the first time that people know a dragon had killed a human in 33 years. Local people blamed the attack on environmentalists. People from outside the island had stopped local people from killing goats and leaving them for the dragons. The Komodo dragons no longer found the food they needed, so they came into places where humans lived in search of food. Many natives of Komodo Island believe that Komodo dragons are actually the reincarnation of relatives and should be treated with respect.

On March 24, 2009, two Komodo dragons attacked and killed fisherman Muhamad Anwar on Komodo Island. They attacked Anwar after he fell out of a sugar-apple tree. He was bleeding badly from bites on his hands, body, legs, and neck. He was taken to a clinic on the nearby island of Flores, but doctors said he was dead when he arrived.

There are very few Komodo dragons, and they may not survive. The lizards are on the IUCN Red List of animals in danger. Not many Komodo dragons still live on their home islands.

However, there may now be only 350 females having babies in the wild. The Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to protect the Komodo dragon on its home islands. 

Many things have reduced the number of dragons, including: volcanoes, earthquakes, loss of good places to live, fire, not enough animals to eat, tourism, and illegal hunting.

Buying or selling Komodo dragons or their skins is illegal as part of an international law called CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species).

The Harlem Globetrotters are an exhibition basketball team that combines athleticism and comedy. They are a "barnstorming" team, which means they travel around the world playing basketball in many different places. Sometimes they play college or pro teams, but usually they play a team called the Washington Generals.

They were founded in 1925 in Chicago. Almost all there players are African-American, which was unusual at the time (at that time, most professional basketball players). In the 1930s and 1940s, they were one of the best basketball teams in the country, along with the New York Rens, another African-American basketball team. By the 1950s, a lot of black players started playing in the NBA, and the Globetrobbers became a clown team. 

The most well-known Globetrotter is Meadowlark Lemon. Wilt Chamberlain played for the Globetrotters for awhile. They were placed in the Basketball Hall of Fame as a team in 2001.

Graduate school

A graduate school (or grad school) is a school that gives advanced academic degrees, such as master's degrees (M.S. or MBA ...) and doctoral degrees (Ph.D. or L.L.D. or D.D.S. etc.). A graduate student (or grad student) is a student who goes to the school. Also, in British English, the phrase "postgraduate student" is more common.

Usually, students must have an undergraduate (bachelor's) degree before beginning graduate school. Many universities give graduate degrees. A graduate school is not always a separate school.

The term "graduate school" could be confusing because the verb "graduate" is also used to mean completing high school education or a bachelor's degree (known as an "undergraduate degree"). The verb infinitive "to graduate" is used for all those types of schools, but the meaning of the adjective "graduate" is changed to mean "postgraduate" in the term "graduate school". The small change in meaning can be viewed with an air of sophistication, where experienced students are often more aware of the issue, while novice students might not be aware, as being more naive.

It was first given in Fall 1959 by Everett Franklin Lindquist as a competitor to the College Board's Scholastic Aptitude Test, now the SAT Reasoning Test. Some students who perform poorly on the SAT find that they perform better on the ACT and vice versa. The ACT test is made of 4 tests: English, Math, Reading, and Science reasoning. In February 2005, an optional writing test was added to the ACT, like changes to the SAT that took place later in March of the same year.

Wikipedia:Disruptive changing

Disruptive changing is when many of a user's changes put together stop other users from improving pages, or causes other effects that stop people from achieving our purpose of building an encyclopedia.

Wikipedia works because it is a very open place where everyone can edit. However, that openness sometimes means that people who come here to promote , or find it easy to do so. While different viewpoints are welcome when through , and constructive users occasionally make mistakes, sometimes a Wikipedia user creates long-term problems by "persistently" changing a page or set of pages with information which is not through or insisting on giving to a view that is not held by most people.

Put together, disruptive changes harm Wikipedia by making it less reliable as a reference source and by making productive users discouraged or even quit when they spend energy trying to improve Wikipedia and see disruptive people go unpunished.

It is very important to recognize "patterns" of disruptive changing. Our already acknowledges that one act, by itself, may not violate policy, but when it is part of a series of acts that form a pattern it can still violate policy. Disruptive changes may not occur all in the course of one 24 hour period, and may not be the same thing done over and over. This does not have to mean that the user's changes are any less disruptive to the project.

Disruptive users may seek to hide their behavior as productive changing, but certain marks separate them from productive users. When discussion does not help the problem and when a group of fair users from outside the argument agree (through or similar means), any more behaviour of the kind that was being disruptive can lead to blocks through the or to more serious disciplinary action through the process. In extreme cases this could include a site ban by the consensus of the community.

, if observed, must not be used as a defense against action taken to enforce this policy. As stated in that policy:
Disruptive changing is against our policies, yet certain users have managed to be disruptive for many reasons:

This guideline concerns gross, obvious and repeated violations of basic policies, not subtle questions about which reasonable people may disagree.
A disruptive user is a user who:
In addition, such users may:

Users often post minority views to articles. This fits within Wikipedia's mission so long as the contributions are and do not give . The burden of evidence rests with the user who initially provides the information or wishes the information to remain. 

From : 

Verifiable and noteworthy viewpoints include protoscience as published through reputable peer-reviewed journals. Users may reasonably present active public disputes or controversies which are documented by reliable sources. This exemption does not apply to settled disputes; for example, insertion of claims that the Sun revolves around the Earth would not be appropriate today; even though this issue was active controversy in the time of Galileo.

Sometimes well-meaning users may be misled by fringe publications or make honest mistakes when representing a citation. Such people may reasonably defend their positions for a short time, then concede the issue when they encounter better evidence or impartial feedback. Articles are acceptable which document widely discredited hypotheses (and/or their advocates) which have an organized following, such as the Flat Earth Society. However, claims that the Earth is flat would be inappropriate in articles such as Earth or geography, even if presented as a minority opinion.

In order to protect against frivolous accusations and other potential exploitation, no user shall be eligible for a disruptive user block until after a consensus of neutral parties has agreed that a user has behaved in a disruptive manner. This consensus can be achieved through , , , or similar means. This does not include users whose changes constitute violations of probation or other change restrictions, who may be blocked for such changes independent of this guideline.

Following is a model for remedies, though these steps do not necessarily have to be done in this sequence. In some extreme circumstances a rapid report to may be the best first step, in others, a fast track to a may be in order. But in general, most situations can benefit from a gradual escalation, with hope that each step may help resolve the problem, such that further steps are not needed:

It is important to be as patient and kind as possible. Techniques such as reverting need to be combined with sincere efforts to turn the user toward productive work. Only when users show themselves unwilling or unable to set issues aside and work harmoniously with others, for the benefit of the project, should they be regarded as irredeemable, and politely but firmly removed.

Pakistan Declaration

The Pakistan Declaration (titled Now or Never; Are We to Live or Perish Forever?) was a pamphlet published in January 1933 by Choudhary Rahmat Ali in which the word Pakistan was used for the first time.

The pamphlet was written when Pakistan was part of British India. The pamphlet asked that the "the five Northern units of India" - Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Afghan Province), Kashmir, Sindh and Baluchistan (or Pakstan) become an independent state and not part of India.

After the pamphlet was published the name of Pakistan became very popular and led to the Pakistan Movement. Fourteen years after the pamphlet was published, in 1947, Pakistan became an independent state.

Pamphlet

A pamphlet is a small book without a hard cover or binding). It can be made up of a single sheet of paper that is printed on both sides and folded in half, in thirds, or in fourths (called a leaflet).

It can also be made up of a few pages that are folded in half and stapled at the crease to make a simple book. In order to count as a pamphlet, UNESCO requires the pamphlet to have 'at least 5 but not more than 48 pages' not including the cover page; a longer item is a book.

Pamphlets can contain anything, it may include information on kitchen appliances, instructions as well as religious and political ideas. Pamphlets have been very important in history, publishing a lot of pamphlets can help spread ideas, for instance during the Russian Revolution pamphlets were used to influence people. Pamphlets are also very important in marketing as they are cheap to produce and can be distributed easily to customers.

Sexual dimorphism

Sexual dimorphism is a concept from biology. It means that the male and the female of a species look noticeably different. The word comes from two Greek: "di" (two) and "morphe" (form). 

It is the most common type of polymorphism. It gives rise to sexual selection, that is, competition between members of the same species for reproduction.

The features that distinguish the two sexes of a species are called secondary sex characteristics. They are not directly part of the reproductive system. They are the product of sexual selection for traits which give an individual an advantage over its rivals in getting and keeping mates.

The difference between sexes can include:

The main functions of sexual dimorphism are to improve the individual's chance of mating in various ways:

Some animals show these differences only during mating season. Deer shed their antlers and peacocks shed their tails out of season. This minimises the key disadvantage of sexual dimorphism. That is, it makes the male much easier to see by predators.

Jonathan Swift

Jonathan Swift (30 November 1667 – 19 October 1745) was an Anglo-Irish satirist, essayist, political pamphleteer (first for Whigs then for the Tories), poet and cleric. He became Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin. 

He is remembered for books and poems he wrote like: "Gulliver's Travels", "A Modest Proposal", "A Journal to Stella", "Drapier's Letters", "The Battle of the Books", "An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity", and "A Tale of a Tub". Swift is probably the most well known prose satirist in the English language. He is less well known for his poetry.

Swift originally published all of his work under pseudonyms — such as Lemuel Gulliver, Isaac Bickerstaff, M.B. Drapier — or anonymously. He is known for being a master of two styles of satire; the Horatian and Juvenalian styles.

Swift was a good writer, famous for his satires. The most recent collection of his prose works (Herbert Davis, ed. Basil Blackwell, 1965-) comprises fourteen volumes. A recent edition of his complete poetry (Pat Rodges, ed. Penguin, 1983) is 953 pages long. One edition of his correspondence (David Woolley, ed. P. Lang, 1999) fills three volumes.

John Ruskin named him as one of the three people in history who were the most influential for him.

Cato the Elder

Marcus Porcius Cato (Latin: ) (234 BC, Tusculum–149 BC) was a Roman statesman, surnamed the Censor ("Censorius"), "Sapiens, Priscus", or the Elder ("Major"), to distinguish him from Cato the Younger (his great-grandson).

He came of an ancient Plebeian family who all were noted for some military service but not for the discharge of the higher civil offices. He was bred, after the manner of his Latin forefathers, to agriculture, to which he devoted himself when not engaged in military service. But, having attracted the notice of Lucius Valerius Flaccus, he was brought to Rome, and successively held the offices of Cursus Honorum: Tribune (214 BC), Quaestor (204 BC), Aedile (199 BC), Praetor (198 BC), Consul (195 BC) together with his old patron, and finally Censor (184 BC).

<doc id="142144" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142144" title="Kavirondo">
Kavirondo

Kavirondo is the old name of the region around Kavirondo Gulf (now Winam Gulf) as well as of two native peoples living there under the regime of British East Africa (The "Nilotic Kavirondo" and the "Bantu Kavirondo"). Broadly, this was defined as those who dwelt in the valley of the Nzoia River, on the western slopes of Mount Elgon, and along the northeast coast of Victoria Nyanza. 

Suggested origins of the name "Kavirondo" include 
Kavirondo is the general name of two distinct groups of tribes: The Bantu immigrated from the south and the other Nilotic, came from the north. The Bantu appear to have been the first. The Nilotic tribes are probably an offshoot of the Acholi. They appear to have crossed the lake to reach their current home, the country around Kavirondo Gulf. Of the two groups the Bantu now occupy a more northerly position than their neighbors, and are practically the most northerly representatives of that race (Hobley). Their further progress north was stopped by the southward movement of the Nilotic tribes, while the Nilotic Kavirondo in their turn had their wanderings arrested by an irruption of Elgumi people (themselves probably of Nilotic origin) from the east. 

The Bantu Kavirondo are divided into three principal types: the Awa-Rimi, the Awa-Ware and the Awa-Kisii. Their Bantu neighbors call the Nilotic Kavirondo "Ja-Mwa". The generic name for the Nilotic tribes is "Ja-Luo", but the Bantu Kavirondo call them "Awa-Nyoro". The two groups have many characteristics in common. 

The Kavirondo have many tribes, divided, Sir H. H. Johnston suspects, totemically.

Traditionally, these people seem to be naked. The men of the Nilotic Kavirondo start to wear a small piece of goat-skin on their penis when they become fathers. This is called "Sembe". Even though this covering is practically useless as a covering, ettiquette says it must still be worn. Even those men who wear clothes must wear the goat-skin, when they are fathers. 

Men of the tribe have traveled more, and have had more contact with white people. Some of the tribesmen now wear European-style clothing. Women traveled less, or were more conservative. They kept the nudity, or the few garments they had before.

Among the Bantu Kavirondo married women wear a short fringe of black string in front and a tassel of banana fiber suspended from a girdle behind. This tassel looks like a tail from a distance. The first travelers to Africa talked about a "tailed race". The Nilotic Kavirondo women wear the tail, but not the fringe in front. For dandy they wear a goat-skin slung over the shoulders. 

Some of the Bantu tribes practice circumcision, the Nilotic tribes do not. Patterns are tattooed on chest and stomach for ornament. Men, even husbands, are forbidden to touch the women's tails, which must be worn even should any other clothing be wrapped round the body. 

The Kavirondo are known for being independent, eager, and ready to fight. They are seen as honest, and as having a high sexual morality, traits common among the Bantu tribes. There are more women than men. For this reason, polygamy is common.

Among the Bantu tribes a man has the refusal of all the younger sisters of his wife as they attain puberty. Practically no woman lives unmarried all her life, for if no suitor seeks her, she singles out a man and offers herself to him at a reduced price, an offer usually accepted, as the women are excellent agricultural laborers. The Nilotic Kavirondo incline to exogamy, endeavoring always to marry outside their clan. Girls are betrothed at six or seven, and the husband-elect continually makes small presents to his father-in-law-elect till the bride reaches womanhood. It is regarded as shameful if the girl be not found a virgin on her wedding day. She is sent back to her parents, who have to return the marriage price, and pay a fine. The wife's adultery was formerly punished with death, and the capital penalty was also inflicted on young men and girls guilty of adultery. Among the Bantu Kavirondo the usual minimum price for a wife is forty hoes, twenty goats and one cow, paid in installments. The Nilotic Kavirondo pay twenty sheep and two to six cows; the husband-elect can claim his bride after half payment; if a woman dies without bearing children, the amount of her purchase is returnable by her father, unless the widower consents to replace her by another sister. The women are prolific and the birth of twins is common and considered a lucky event, which is celebrated by feasting and dances. Among the Bantu Kavirondo the mother of twins must remain in her hut for seven days; among the Nilotic Kavirondo the parents and the infants must stay in the hut for a whole month. If a Bantu mother has lost two children in succession, the next child born is taken out at dawn and placed on the road, where it is left till a neighbor, usually a woman friend who has gone that way on purpose, picks it up and takes it to its mother who gives a goat in return; a somewhat similar custom prevails among the Niotic tribes. Names are not male and female, and a daughter often bears her fathers name.

The Kavirondo bury their dead. Among one of the Bantu tribes, the Awa-Kisesa, a chief is buried in the floor of his own hut in a sitting position, but at such a depth that the head protrudes. Over the head an earthenware pot is placed, and his principal wives have to remain in the hut till the flesh is eaten by ants or decomposes, when the skull is removed and buried close to the hut. Later the skeleton is unearthed, and reburied with much ceremony in the sacred burial place of the tribe. Married women of the Bantu tribes are buried in their hut lying on their right side with legs doubled up, the hut being then deserted. Among the Nilotic tribes the grave is dug beneath the veranda of the hut. Men of the Bantu tribes are buried in an open space in the midst of their huts; in the Nilotic tribes, if the first wife of the deceased be alive he is buried in her hut, if not, beneath the veranda of the hut in which he died. A child is buried near the door of its mothers hut. A sign of mourning is a cord of banana fiber worn round the neck and waist.

A chief chooses, sometimes years before his death, one of his sons to succeed him, often giving a brass bracelet as insignia. A man's property is divided equally among his children.

While some tribes live in isolated huts, those in the north have strongly walled villages. The walls are of mud and formerly, among the Nilotic tribes, occasionally of stone. Since colonization by the British the security of the country induced the Kavirondo to let the walls fall into disrepair. Their huts are circular with conical thatched roofs, and fairly broad verandas all round.

A portion of the hut is partitioned off as a sleeping-place for goats, and the fowls sleep indoors in a large basket. Skins form the only bedsteads. In each hut are two fireplaces, about which a rigid etiquette prevails. Strangers or distant relatives are not allowed to pass beyond the first, which is near the door, and is used for cooking. At the second, which is nearly in the middle of the hut, sits the hut owner, his wives, children, brothers and sisters. Around this fireplace the family sleep.

Cooking pots, water pots and earthenware grain jars are the only other furniture. The food is served in small baskets. Every full-grown man has a hut to himself, and one for each wife. The huts of the Masaba Kavirondo of west Elgon have the apex of the roof surmounted by a carved pole which Sir H. H. Johnston says is obviously a phallus. Among the Bantu Kavirondo a father does not eat with his sons, nor do brothers eat together. Among the Nilotic tribes father and sons eat together, usually in a separate hut with open sides. Women eat apart and only after the men have finished. 

Though a peaceful people the Kavirondo fight well. Their weapons are spears with rather long flat blades without blood-courses and broad-bladed swords. Some use slings, and most carry shields. Bows and arrows are also used; firearms are however displacing other weapons. Kavirondo warfare was mainly defensive and intertribal, this last a form of vendetta. When a man had killed his enemy in battle he shaved his head on his return and was rubbed with medicine (generally goats dung), to defend him from the spirit of the dead man. The Awa-Wanga abandoned this custom when they obtained firearms. The young warriors were made to stab the bodies of their slain enemies. 

In the colonial era the Kavirondo are on the increase due to their fecundity and morality. Those who live in the low-lying lands suffer from a mild malaria, while abroad they are subject to dysentery and pneumonia. Epidemics of small-pox have occurred. Native medicine is of the simplest. They dress wounds with butter and leaves, and for inflammation of the lungs or pleurisy, pierce a hole in the chest. There are no medicine-men: the women are the doctors. Certain of the incisor teeth are pulled out. If a man retains these he will, it is thought, be killed in warfare. Among certain tribes the women also have incisor teeth extracted, otherwise misfortune would befall their husbands. For the same reason the wife scars the skin of her forehead or stomach. A Kavirondo husband, before starting on a perilous journey, cuts scars on his wife's body to ensure him good luck.

Of dances, the Kavirondo have the birth dance, the death dance, that at initiation and one of a propitiatory kind in seasons of drought. Their music is plaintive and sometimes pretty, produced by a large lyre-shaped instrument. They also use various drums.

The Ja-Luo women use small beads attached to pieces of brass for ear ornaments. Like the aggry beads of West Africa these beads are not of local manufacture nor of recent introduction. They are ancient, generally blue in color, occasionally yellow or green, and are picked up in certain districts after heavy rain. The natives believe they come down with the rain. They are identical in shape and color to ancient Egyptian beads and other beads obtained from ancient cities in Baluchistan.

They appears to practice a vague ancestor worship, but the northern tribes have two gods, Awafwa and Ishishemi, the spirits of good and evil. To the former, cattle and goats are sacrificed. 

The Kavirondo have great faith in divination from the entrails of a sheep. Nearly everybody and everything are ominous of good or evil to the Kavirondo. 

They have few myths or traditions; the antbear is the chief figure in their beast-legends. 

They believe in witchcraft and practice trial by ordeal.

The Kavirondo are essentially an agricultural people: both men and women work in the fields with large iron hoes. In addition to sorghum, Eleusine and maize, tobacco and hemp are both cultivated and smoked. Both sexes smoke, but the use of hemp is restricted to men and unmarried women, as it is thought to injure child-bearing women. Hemp is smoked in a hubble-bubble. The Kavirondo cultivate sesamum and make an oil from its seeds which they burn in little clay lamps of the ancient saucer type, the pattern being, in Hobley's opinion, introduced into the country by the coast people. 

The Kavirondo keep cattle, sheep, goats, fowls and a few dogs. Women do not eat sheep, fowls or eggs, and are not allowed to drink milk except when mixed with other things. The flesh of the wild cat and leopard is esteemed by most of the tribes. Among the Bantu Kavirondo goats and sheep are suffocated, the snout being held until the animal dies. From Eleusine a beer is made. 

The Kavirondo are plucky hunters, capturing the hippopotamus with ropes and traps, and attacking with spears the largest elephants. Fish, of which they are very fond, are caught by line and rod or in traps. Bee-keeping is common, and where trees are scarce the hives are placed on the roof of the hut. 

Traditional Kavirondo industries are salt-making, effected by burning reeds and water-plants and passing water through the ashes; the smelting of iron ore (confined to the Bantu tribes); pottery and basket-work.

The Five Families are the five major Italian-American Mafia crime families which have controlled organized crime in New York City since the 1930s. The Five Families, under the suggestion of Salvatore Maranzano and Charles "Lucky" Luciano, were responsible for the establishment of The Commission, a council that changed how things worked with Mafia activities in the United States. 
The five families and their bosses are (currently):
The Colombo family was once known as the Profaci Crime Family, until a coup caused a name change in the early 1960s. Former Godfather Joe Massino had wanted to change the name of the Bonanno Family to the Massino Family but since his arrest and defection it is unlikely to happen. The DeCavalcante crime family, based in nearby Elizabeth, NJ, also has ties to the five New York families.

This is a template for rendering simple family trees consisting of boxes and connecting lines based on an ASCII art-like syntax. The trees are displayed as HTML tables using CSS attributes, and may contain arbitrary wiki markup within the boxes.

This code:

Produces this:

This template produces one row in a family tree table. The template accepts up to 99 unnamed parameters describing the contents of the table. Each parameter specifies a tile or a box.



The appearance of the boxes may be controlled by the optional template parameters "border" and "boxstyle". The former sets the width of the box border in pixels, while the latter can be used to append arbitrary CSS declarations directly to the box style attributes. For example, the following code:

produces a result like this:

Style attributes can even be set for individual boxes, as in the example below:

which produces the output:

NOTE: When specifying style attributes for individual named boxes, make sure the box names are aligned to the left side of area reserved for them in the template call (as in "codice_1" instead of "codice_2" in the example above). Otherwise the template will end up looking for a style parameter with spaces in its name.

The template also accepts an optional "style" parameter that can be used to set CSS styles for the entire table.

Galago, also known as bushbabies, bush babies or nagapies (meaning "little night monkeys" in Afrikaans), are small, nocturnal primates native to continental Africa, from the family Galagidae.
Range varies with species but includes most of the forested and bush regions of Africa south of the Sahara including some of the nearby islands such as Zanzibar. Their range does not extend to Madagascar.
Galagos are all arboreal and known for their ability to leap great distances among branches.
Galagos are omnivorous but primarily insectivorous. Their favorite food is grasshoppers, but they also eat small birds, eggs, fruits, seeds and flowers. Euoticus has specialized front teeth for removing tree bark so it can feed on tree gum.

The Mongolic languages are a group of languages that are spoken in Central Asia. Some linguists propose to put Mongolic languages in the same group as the Turkic and Tungusic languages. They call this group the Altaic languages, but not all linguists agreed upon this.

The best-known member of this language family is Mongolian. In Cyrillic orthography as it is used in Mongolia it is written Монгол Хэл, and in the vertical Uygur-derived script as used in it is Inner Mongolia in China it is written Mongγol Kele).

Musée d'Orsay

The Musée d'Orsay is an art museum in Paris. The building was firstly used as the station which was founded in 1900. It was used about 40 years and in 1986, it changed into the museum which is highly famous today. 

The museum exhibits artworks of 19 centuries including impressionism paintings. It has a lot of impressionism exhibits which was painted by Monet, Degas, Renoir, Cezanne, Manet, Van Gogh, etc. That's the reaon why The Orsay is called 'impressionism museum.' 

The building had been founded in 1804 as the supreme court but because of fire, it was rebuilt in 1900 as the station. Around 40 years later, working as the station had to be stopped because the length of the platforms was shorter than newly made trains for manline services. So the station changed its role for suburban services and a mailing center during the second World War. 
In 1970, there was an argument related to the building. Some people insisted that removing the building would be better and got a permission from the Minister while the others asserted that it had to be maintained since they thought it was the Historic Monuments. The opponents of destroying the building suggested how about using it as the museum and it was accepted. After the construction for transforming it into the museum, in July 1986, it became the Musée d'Orsay which has had the 2000 or so paintings, 600 sculptures and other works. 

His well-known works are "The sower," "The Gleaners," "The Angelus", etc.
His famous pieces are "Balcony," "Nana," "Déjeuner sur I'herbe," "l'Olympia," etc.
His famous paintings are "Dancer on Stage," "absinthe," "The dance class," etc.
His well-known pieces are "L'Estaque," "The Card Players," "Les Grandes Baigneuses," "Mont Saint e-Victoire," etc. 
He is famous for "Impression : Sunrise," "Rouen Cathedral," "Nymphéas", etc.

The Last Judgement (Michelangelo)

The Last Judgment is a mural by Michelangelo on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City. It took nine years to complete. Michelangelo began working on it thirty years after finishing the ceiling of the chapel.

The work spans the entire wall behind the altar of the Sistine Chapel. It was painted between 1534 and 1541. The Last Judgment shows the second coming of Christ and the apocalypse. The souls of humans rise and descend to their fates, as judged by Christ surrounded by his saints.

There was a dispute regarding "The Last Judgment" between Cardinal Carafa and Michelangelo: Michelangelo was accused of immorality and obscenity, because he had painted naked figures, with their genitals well visible. The cardinal said that this could not be tolerated inside the most important church of Christianity. A censorship campaign was lauched, known as the "Fig-leaf campaign". Carafa and Monsignor Sernini (Mantua's ambassador) launched the campaign to remove the frescoes. When the Pope's own Master of Ceremonies, Biagio da Cesena, said "it was mostly disgraceful that in so sacred a place there should have been depicted all those nude figures, exposing themselves so shamefully," and that it was no work for a papal chapel but rather "for the public baths and taverns," Michelangelo worked the Cesena's semblance into the scene as Minos, judge of the underworld (far bottom-right corner of the painting). It is said that when Cesena complained to the Pope, the pontiff responded that his jurisdiction did not extend to hell, so the portrait would have to remain.

The genitalia in the fresco were later covered by the artist Daniele da Volterra, whom history remembers by the derogatory nickname "Il Braghettone" ("the breeches-painter").

In the painting, Michelangelo does a self portrait depicting himself as St. Bartholomew after he had been flayed (skinned alive) This is reflective of the feelings of contempt Michelangelo had for being commissioned to paint "The Last Judgement".

Fancy rat

The fancy rat or pet rat is a type of the brown rat ("Rattus norvegicus") that is bred to be a pet. The name "fancy rat" has nothing to do with the "fanciness" of how they look. It comes from the phrase "animal fancy". A person who keeps pet rats is said to be involved in "rat fancy." Some people domesticate black rats ("Rattus rattus"), and Gambian pouched rats ("Cricetomys gambianus"). These types of rats are not usually called fancy rats because the hobby does not center around them.

Fancy rats have been bred as pets at least since the late 19th century. They can have many different colors and coat types. They are sociable, intelligent animals. They can learn to come when called, use a litter box, and do many different tricks. Pet rats act differently from rats found in nature. The number of generations since they have been removed from the wild and how they were bred has an effect on how much they act differently. They are not any more of a health risk than other common pets.

Gymnasium (ancient Greece)

In Ancient Greece the Gymnasion (or Gymnasium, romanized name) was a place were athletes could train for the competitions in public games, such as the Olympic Games. "Gymnos" means naked. Only men were allowed to enter, and train; they did so fully naked (as the name implies). Athletes also competed in the nude. This was said to encourage aesthetic appreciation of the male body. It was believed to be a tribute to the Gods. Gymnasia and palestrae were under the protection and patronage of Heracles, Hermes and, in Athens, Theseus.

 The picture above shows the Pompeii gymnasium from the top of the stadium wall. The depression in the center-left of the picture was filled with water and used for swimming practice as well. Mock sea battles (naumachiae) took place in the flooded arena floor or a specially dug pool in the arena. According to Oscar Brockett in his History of the Theatre, 5th Ed. (1987), p. 70, "Perhaps the most spectacular of all entertainments were the naumachiae, or sea battles. The first was given in 46 B.C. by Julius Caesar on a lake dug for the occasion; it featured a battle involving 2,000 marines and 6,000 oarsmen. Later the amphitheatres were sometimes flooded for such events. By far the most ambitious of all the naumachiae was given in 52 A.D. on the Fucine Lake east of Rome to celebrate the completion of a water conduit. On that occasion, 19,000 participants fought and many perished. To the right of the picture (partially behind a tree trunk) is a line of carbonized tree stumps. These are the remains of trees (each hundreds of years old) that were part of the palaistra. They were burned in the volcanic eruption of 79. Between these and the colonnade is a line of saplings recently planted as a replacement.

<doc id="142307" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142307" title="1857 War of Independence in Murree">
1857 War of Independence in Murree

The 1857 War of Independence in Murree, part of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, was a conflict between the tribes surrounding the hill station of Murree (now Pakistan) and the colonial government of British India. The local tribes had become angry with the British ever since the British had started their colonial rule in the area.

Today Murree is part of Pakistan but in 1857 it was part of British India, ever since the British rule began in India there had been rebellions and wars against the British. However in 1857 rebellions broke out in many different places, Murree being one of these places. People thought the rule of the British was about to be overthrown. In the Murree hills it was the Dhund Abbasi and Tanoli tribes who rose up against the British.

Although the tribes of Murree had risen against the British, not everyone had been against British rule. Before British rule had been established in the area, the tribes had fought against the Sikhs. Under the command of Mohammed Ali Shah (also known as the Pir of Plasi), they had fought against the Sikh Army in Balakot - the troops here were commanded by Seyed Shah Ismail Shahid and Syed Ahmad Shaheed (known as "The Martyrs").

The Pir of Dewal had also died fighting in Dewal against the Sikh army chief Hari Singh Nalwa, Nalwa then built a fort on between Punjab and North-West Frontier Province in 1815, now called Aarhi or Hadd. Nalwa's troops had brutally crushed the tribes of Circle Bakote and beheaded many of them. He also sold the ladies of these tribes in Jammu central bazaar in 1834, 

The British, after battling in Rawalpindi in 1845 had captured Jind Kaur, the widow of Ranjit Singh (the former Ruler of Punjab) - this caused the collapse of Sikh rule and, when the British marched into the Murree area, the local tribes at first welcomed them. However, many of the tribes soon considered that they had exchanged one form of occupation for another and events elsewhere in India also encouraged an uprising. 

The British had recruited many of the tribes in the area into their army, for example many members of the Satti Tribe were recruited as Sepoys and the British commanders (like elsewhere across Colonial India) won this war largely by the use of Indian soldiers.

The masterminds of this plan of independence were two Seyed brothers from Dhoke Syedan of Dewal Sharif. The War against the British had reached Murree and the Southern Areas of Hazara part of which is now known as Circle Bakote in July 1857 when the Dhond Abbasi leader Sardar Sherbaz Khan planned to attack the British.

Sardar Khan had the support of the following important tribal leaders.

By the end of August many of the British troops who had been in Murree had left to join the attack on Delhi. Rebels had taken Delhi from British control and the British had sent as many soldiers as they could. The decision to send troops to Delhi meant that the defence of Murree was weakened. However the British were unable to take Delhi quickly, and as Delhi still held out against the British the Dhund tribesmen decided to take Murree. The Dhund attacked Murree by rising on every side at the same time and crowding up the nearer hill-sides threatening destruction of the station. Several of the table-servants supported the hill-men, and for some hours the danger to Murree became imminent.

According to the 1857 Punjab Mutiny Report the attack failed because the British were told of the plan to attack them. One of Lady Lawrence's servants, named Hakim Khan, told the British of the attack to come. The loyalty of Hakim was described in the report as "the means, under God, of saving Murree." The British quickly organised defences, and quickly got volunteers. A cordon of sentries surrounded the station and the three weakest points were held in some force. When the Dhunds arrived in the middle of the night they found the whole station waiting for them.

After a few hours of skirmishing the Dhonds retreated with the loss of two or three of their men who had come within musket range of the British. The British however were to learn that the rebellion was wider than just the Dhonds. After the Dhoonds had been forced back, it was found that many more clans and tribes had been part of the plan. It had reached far into Hazara and nearly down to Rawalpindi; and, apart from the Khurrul rebellion in Multan, was largest rebellion that had occurred in the Punjab during that year.

The British also convicted and executed two Hindustani doctors for being involved in the plot. They had been educated in government institutions, were practising in Murree and employed by the government. The British suspected that the Dhonds were expecting support from their Hindustani allies, so as well as the doctors several domestic servants were seized and punished. 

An urgent request was sent to troops in Hazara to reinforce Murree and Major Beecher sent every available man from Abbottabad to Murree - however the British troops in Murree had managed to secure the station and beat off the attack before the arrival of reinforcements. 

According the Punjab Mutiny report however, the reinforcement themselves were almost ambushed. The march from Abbottabad to Murree was difficult. The Khurrals laid an ambush to cut them off, but they were saved by luck. The Khurral had set traps and were waiting to ambush the British on a road, however the rains made the road hard to cross. The British took another road to Murree and were later to learn of the trap..

The revolt did not succeed, he rebels were betrayed and, as punishment, all of Sardar Sherbaz Khan's eight sons were blasted by cannon fire in Murree whilst Sardar Khan himself was hanged.

Pygmy marmosets have tawny agouti fur (the tip of the hair is a different color to the base) with an indistinctly dark-ringed tail.

They live in flooded forest near rivers, bamboo thickets and the edges of agricultural fields.

Pygmy marmosets mainly feed on gum (tree exudates, sap), but they also eat fruit, nectar and animal prey. They gouge holes in the bark of trees, and revisit these holes daily to collect the sap.

Christopher Jonathan James Nolan (born July 30, 1970) is a British/American film director, writer and producer. He often works with his brother, author Jonathan Nolan. Nolan is best known for directing the psychological thriller "Memento", and for reviving the "Batman" film franchise as the director of "Batman Begins" (2005) and "The Dark Knight" (2008). He is also the founder of the production company, Syncopy Films.

In the months following the release of "The Prestige" (one of Nolan's other movies), Nolan made many comments suggesting that he would return to direct the sequel to "Batman Begins". In late July 2006, the sequel was officially confirmed as "The Dark Knight" with Nolan at the helm and Heath Ledger joining the cast as The Joker, Batman's arch-nemesis. Nolan and his brother Jonathan wrote a script, based on a treatment written by himself and David S. Goyer. The film began production in early 2007 and was released on July 18 2008 in the United States, to overwhelming critical acclaim. It has also made a lot of money, setting the record for the highest-grossing weekend opening in the U.S. with over $158 million.

Mickie James

Mickie Laree James (born August 31, 1979) is an American professional wrestler who is currently working for TNA. She worked for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on its SmackDown and Raw brands.

James started wrestling in 1999 as a valet on the independent circuit using the name Alexis Laree. She trained in several places to get better at wrestling before working for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in June 2002. She first became well known while she was while working at TNA. Soon after she started working for TNA, she joined a stable called The Gathering. She is also the only woman to be a part of Clockwork Orange House of Fun matches.

James started working with WWE in October 2005. She was a part of a storyline with Trish Stratus. James' gimmick was that she was Stratus' biggest fan and later became Stratus' stalker. This storyline lasted almost a year. The person at WWE believed she was doing good work. Because of this, she won her first WWE Women's Championship at WrestleMania 22. She has held the championship a total of four times.

Outside of wrestling, James has an associate of arts degree in business administration. She is studying for her Bachelor of Arts degree in operations management. James grew up on a farm and has an interest in horses. She owns three Morgan horses. James has been riding since she was 11 years old.

Mickie James was raised on a farm with her sister Latoya in Montpelier, Virginia. She is of Native American heritage. As a child, she watched weekend horse shows. James started riding horses when she was eleven years old after her grandmother bought her a horse. James was a fan of professional wrestling as a child. She used to watch wrestling with her father. Her favorite wrestlers were Randy Savage, Ricky Steamboat and Ric Flair. 

James started her training at a professional wrestling school in the Washington, D.C. area. She started her wrestling career on the independent circuit in 1999. Her first work was as a valet for KYDA Pro Wrestling using the ring name Alexis Laree. The name is a combination of her stage name from when she was a dancer and her middle name. As Laree, she managed several male wrestlers. This included managing Tommy Dreamer to win the KYDA Pro Heavyweight Championship. In March, she wrestled in her first match. It was an intergender tag team match with Jake Damian against American Mike Brown and Candie. James trained to get better at wrestling at many places. These places include the Funking Conservatory run by Dory Funk, Jr. and an Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) dojo. She also started wrestling for Maryland Championship Wrestling. While there, she was trained by Ricky Morton and Bobby Eaton. Because the indepedant circuit did not pay enough, James worked as a waitress at an Olive Garden restaurant. Trish Stratus, a former WWE wrestler, was and still is Mickie James' role model

James worked in Ring of Honor for a year. During this time, she also started wrestling in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. As Alexis Laree, she was a part of a lingerie battle royal. On March 26, 2003, she teamed with Amazing Red against Kid Kash—the X Division Champion—and Trinity. Weeks later, she became the first member of the Gathering, a stable led by Raven. On April 16, Laree became the first (and currenly, only) woman to wrestle in a Clockwork Orange House of Fun match. This match involve the Gathering and Jeff Jarrett. She continued to wrestle with the Gathering when they feuded with the Disciples of The New Church. During this feud, James was kayfabe burned with a fireball by Father James Mitchell. She also wrestled in another Clockwork Orange House of Fun match.

James tried for two years to work for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). In August 2003, she was began to work for the WWE. They sent her to train at Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). James still used the name Alexis Laree at this time. She began making wresting on television for OVW on January 29, 2004. She wrestled in several tag team matches during the year. She won a Halloween Costume Contest on October 30 and defeated Jillian Hall in a $1,000 match on November 12.

Laree began a feud with Beth Phoenix on July 20. This feud started after Phoenix interrupted Laree during an interview. A match took place on July 29. Laree lost to Phoenix. The feud continued into September. Shelly Martinez was added to the storyline to side with Phoenix against Laree. On October 12, she appeared in OVW under her real name. She finished the year losing matches against Martinez and Jillian Hall.

James was first used on televsion in WWE on the October 10 2005 episode of "Raw". She used her real name. James used the gimmick of WWE Women's Champion Trish Stratus' biggest fan. The storyline had the two WWE Divas wrestling together in tag team matches. James' character became more obsessed with Stratus as time went on. A Halloween Costume Contest was part of the story line. James was dressed like Stratus. She even started using Stratus' personal finishing moves as her own during matches. On December 12, James wrestled and defeated Victoria. The match was to decide who would wrestle Stratus at New Year's Revolution for the championship. Lesbian themes were added to the story line with James kissing Stratus under mistletoe and saying nice things to her about her breasts. In the championship match, James lost to Stratus but still showed romantic fellings towards her the next night on "Raw". She told Stratus that she loved her at the Royal Rumble.

On March 6 2006 the storyline had Stratus telling James that they needed time apart from each other. They wrestled as a team at the March 18, 2006 Saturday Night's Main Event. James and Stratus defeated Candice Michelle and Victoria in the match. After the match, James tried to kiss Stratus. Stratus pushed her away and James' character made a complete heel turn. She attacked Stratus in the ring. James' character later said she would destroy Stratus. The two women wrestled each other at WrestleMania 22. James won the match to become the Women's Champion for her first time. During the match, even though James was playing the heel character, the fans liked her more than Stratus. The storyline ended at Backlash with a rematch after Stratus legitimately dislocated her shoulder when James threw her out of the ring. James lost the Women's Title on August 14 to Lita. During the match, Lita hit James with the title belt when Edge distracted the referee. This causes a face turn for James' on-screen character. When Stratus retired as champion, there was no longer a Women's Championship. WWE held a tournament to name a new champion. James was a part of that tournament. She defeated Victoria and Melina in the early parts of the tournament. She made it to the finals at Cyber Sunday. In the final match, she lost to Lita. At the 2006 Survivor Series James defeated Lita to win her second Women's Championship.

A new feud began between James and Melina on January 29 2007. Melina was the number one contender for the Women's Title at the time. James defeated Melina on February 5 to keep the championship.. After this, she teamed with Super Crazy in a mixed tag team match against Melina and Johnny Nitro. Melina defeatd James and challenged her to a rematch for the title. James lost the Women's Championship to Melina on February 19. The two wrestled in the first ever Women's Falls Count Anywhere match in WWE history. James lost to Melina. Near the end of the match, James fell from the turnbuckle. She landed on her neck but was not badly injured.

At a house show in Paris, France on April 24, James won her third Women's Championship. In a Triple Threat Match with Malina and Victoria, James pinned Victoria. However, she did not pin Melina, Jonathan Coachman said that a rematch would take place immediately. James lost the title back to Melina. This gave her the shortest Women’s Championship reign in WWE history.

On the November 26 edition of "Raw", James defeated Melina in a number one contenders match for Beth Phoenix's Women's Championship.. This led to a title match between James and Phoenix at Armageddon 2007. James lost the match to Phoenix. On the April 14, 2008 edition of "Raw", held in London, James defeated Phoenix to win her fourth Women's Championship. At Judgment Day James successfully defended the Women's Championship against Phoenix and Melina in a Triple Threat match. James lost the championship back to Phoenix at SummerSlam 2008. She lost it in an intergender tag team match at SummerSlam. In that match, Her partner Kofi Kingston also lost the Intercontinental Title to Phoenix's partner Santino Marella. Mickie James was released from her WWE contract on April 22, 2010.



James owns three Morgan horses called Rhapsody, Bunny and Casanova. After she has finished her wrestling career, James plans to own a farm and train horses. James also owns a dog named Butch.

Guineafowl

The Guineafowl are a family of birds. It is in the same order as the pheasants, turkeys and other game birds. Guineafowl are native to the dry arid areas of Africa. They are now bred for meat especially in India.

Guineafowl are chicken-like African birds. They include the helmeted guineafowl ("Numida meleagris"). It has a horny growth on the head, white-spotted feathers, and fleshy cheek "wattles" (loose folds of skin). It is the ancestor of the domestic guinea fowl. Guinea fowl mostly eat things found on the ground. They eat insects, leaves, and snails. At night, they roost in trees.

Greetings Simple Wikipedians! I used to have an account but perhaps it's been deactivated due to inactivity. My name is Hunter. I'm teaching a computer course in Chalermkwansatree School in Phitsanulok, Thailand and have given my students an assignment to create content that did not previously exist in Simple English Wikipedia. I have split the class into 15 article-writing groups, 4 English editors and 2 factual content editors. I wanted everybody to have an account like Chalermkwan1, Chalermkwan2, etc., CHSeditor1, etc. We were only allowed to create 6 accounts from the same IP range (we are working from a single computer lab). For this reason, I told any groups that were unable to create an account to just use the Chalermkwan13 account. 

In the meantime, many of the groups have posted their articles and today our editing team was going to begin the proofreading process. I thought it would be most efficient to let them do the editing on wikipedia itself so they can experience first-hand the collaborative working experience. I didn't think any pages would be edited or deleted by moderators in such a short amount of time, so I didn't bother instructing them about what to do if someone deletes their article. Some of them panicked and reversed moderators changes, because they were afraid they would not get points for the assignment. I have instructed my students to refrain from logging in and changing anything until I am able to resolve this issue with the Simple English moderators.

Aem Fatson, I understand your initial suspicions of vandalism and reasons for blocking my students accounts and deleting their articles. But please be patient. We want to enrich Simple English Wikipedia. We have a process in place for correction. If you unblock my students and wait a week or two, I will notify you that our editing teams have finished their work. I am a native speaker and will also play a final supervisory role in the editing process should that be a concern.

FYI, here is a list of the groups and topics that they are working on:

Thanks!

First of all I' like to thank for pointing me to it or I would have never known. Second, I just got an email back from , and she confirmed I was being impersonated. I got the email mere seconds after I withdrew my nomination...I'd love to unwithdraw since I now have this sorted but I think that would be too much trouble to ask of the community. Just please next ime you gonna use socks against me...make sure you can prove their mine and not meant for impersonation. Thank you.--  ✧   19:00, 10 November 2008 (UTC)
Hi all. I as checkuser can confirm that neither of those two accounts on the English Wikipedia are related to ChristianMan16. Aaron contacted me by email this morning, in a panic. I ran a check and both accounts are in California and were created on an iPhone. "So" not ChristianMan16 :) - 19:04, 10 November 2008 (UTC)

Hello,

I have recently seen stubs of the form "XXX is a song by YYY. ZZZZ covered it on their new album AAA". While Wikipedia is not paper, I wonder whether we could get any "guidelines" or "criteria" for including such items? 

These are of course just my thoughts. We also have notability guiidleines/criteria for other items, why not also for songs and artits/bands? -- () 10:44, 11 November 2008 (UTC)

Hello, I was just thinking about how to attract new editors:
In your opinion, how easy would it be to attract people to write/simplify artists about these kinds of subjects? - In theory, there are many more people interested in say, the arts, than there are in say Pokemon monsters 

My idea would be to get a team of say 5-10 people together that were able to provide articles on such subjects..

What do you think?-- () 16:03, 11 November 2008 (UTC)

Hello! I just finished spellchecker installers for Mozilla (Firefox, Thunderbird, Seamonkey) and OpenOffice 3.0, with about 5000 words. They mix the wordlists of SIMPLE.dic and Rick Harrison's Universal Language Dictionary, and fixed a bug in the file simple.aff; Rick's wordlist includes several common words for food, plants and animals, and even body parts missing in the other dictionaries (about 250 words not present in simple.dic). I want to post the installers on the websites of those programs and then add links in these pages, but I'd like to have an opinion from other users. () 17:40, 11 November 2008 (UTC)

Hello all, there is a tool (on ) that can calculate some measure of readabilty; I did some tests on current VGAs, and I found values between 61.0 and 70.0 for Flesch Reading Ease. Before we go and believe in numbers:

Thanks for understanding.-- () 22:30, 13 November 2008 (UTC)

Depending on which of the indices you take, there are also some (language-specific) constants which enter these formulae.
Note however:

Instead of relying on old methodolgy (Flesch is from 1948, Flesh-Kincaid from 1956, SMOG from like 1975) we should get a more recent (less than 10 years old) testing methodology, that ideally also does either lexical or semantic analysis (if possible). The next step is then to go over the 40.000 articles; from those that apply (article length of pure text) calculatuate mean, median and mode of the score. Ideally we thern base our "age group" on the median of what we get there. Once we have determined a mathematical distribution, we can then numerically score each article; based on where it sits in that distribution. This is much better than simply noting "complex"; We than know that an article of complexity 4.8 needs less work than one of complexity 5.
Articles that I have found thast might be useful: 

Some ideas:
Problem: the last one is semantic nonsense (not a valid sentence), the second last has a different meaning. If all you do is count words and syllables, and mingle them up in a formula (as the indices we can automatically calculate with the script do) you will not be able to recognise such things. If you do a frequency analysis, you will see that words like "a" and "the" add little information.

Comments are of course welcome. -- () 09:58, 14 November 2008 (UTC)

There are currently 23 VGAs, I did a little statistics on them:
Flesch Reading Ease ranges from 44.4 to 70.2 (Mean: 57.3, Median: 58.7; no mode); Flesch-Kincaid: 12.9-6.9 (Mean: 9.18, Median: 9.1, Mode: 10.1)

Top three (FRE)

If we take Flesch-Kincaid, we get Charles Spurgeon (FRE 65.2/FC 7,8) together with the Chili Peppers on second place. Pope John Paul II (FRE 64.3/ FC 8.1) is number 3.

The bottom of the list (FRE)

Same game, FC:

The article taken for the Median (of FRE) is Violin, for the mean, you have Violin slightly below, and American Airlines Flight 11 (FRE 59.9/FC 8.7) sligtly above. For FC, you have Violin and Oklahoma (FRE 54.2/FC 9.1) sligntly below the mean/at the median; and Powderfinger (57.8/9.4) slightly above.

Should I do the same thing for good articles? -- () 14:49, 14 November 2008 (UTC)

I couldn't resist, and this the same as above for good articles. There are currently 19.

Flesch Reading Ease: 78.1-53 (Mean/Avg: 66; Median 66.4; Mode: none) Flesch-Kincaid: 12.1-6 (Mean: 8.16; Median 8.1; Mode 8.1)

Top 3 (FRE)

For FK:
MouthPiece replaced by Giant Panda (69.1/6.9) on 3rd place.

Bottom 3 (FRE)

For FK:
Mouthpiece replaces Lenzburg.

Jupiter (66/7.4) is average, for FRE; for the median, Jupiter slighlty below, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District (66.7/7.4) above the median. For FK: Kurt Warner (68.2/8.1) and Caffeine (65.9/8.1) are both at the median; For the mode, Kitzmiller and Jupiter; Muhammad (63.9/8.2) is the first above the mean; Kurt and Caffeine are the first below. 

And of course, full stats available on req. -- () 16:22, 14 November 2008 (UTC)

What can I say? I made some mistakes, and it cost me 'cratship. Isn't that what voting is for anyway? :)

I won't resort to StaticFalconisms and retire over a defeat, and I would like to say that I will still obviously be editing as frequently as before here. I don't think any differently towards those who voted oppose "or" support. To quote Rudyard Kipling, ""If you can meet with triumph and disaster. And treat those two imposters just the same; You'll be a man, my son"".

To clear up issues, the deletion of Manchester was a complete mistake on my part. I saw a long article, read a few sentences and thought it had been copy-pasted from ENWP. As for the RfD, I counted votes, calculated there was about 55 - 60% support for deletion which was too close to a 50/50 vote for my liking, so I closed as keep (I was not aware of the existence of ).

I hope you can all mirror Kipling as I like to think I can, and don't think any differently of me either. Thanks to all who voted on my RfB! -- 10:25, 15 November 2008 (UTC)


Hi all,

Quick question about images, I understand that uploads are not allowed, and to use commons instead... BUT - what if the image is not suitable for commons, i.e. a copyrighted logo?

The two I want (at the moment) are and . I would assume with appropriate FURs it would be ok?

Thanks,

Some kinds of logos do not have any creative output and can be uploaded, but these exceptions are very rare, such as the logo for AIG. () 18:14, 15 November 2008 (UTC)



Ok, I think the wiki is now active enough to allow uploads, so i'm adding this.

Option one is to add an "Image Uploader" right, which will be granted to certain users and allows local image uploads of Fair-Use images. The right would be given to users after a short process, still tbc, to check that they will not abuse it. There would be a requests page that could be used by users without the right to ask for uploads. Comments, please. 03:58, 17 November 2008 (UTC)

Since options 1 and 4 are close, I think we need a bigger vote at the end to really know which one has more support, not everyone voted for all the options. 14:20, 17 November 2008 (UTC)

Sorry guys, but this voting is so totally messed up that it makes it completely impossible to determine any kind of consensus from this. To start off with, we should have said "Sign under the proposal(s) you agree with" and then passed the one with the most. Because of the way we've done it, some people are going to just vote support for the ones they like, and others are going to support the one they like and oppose the rest, making the results useless. And we've carried it on with the "option 1 or 4" thing, because now we're asking absolutely everyone that voted before to come back and vote again, otherwise their votes meant absolutely nothing. I think this needs to be restarted, there is no way everyone will do the same thing when it's this complicated. The results won't actually mean anything. - 19:45, 17 November 2008 (UTC)

Hello all, while the proposal to allow "some kind of image uploads" here (please read on), this is not our focus, and it should not be. We want to make a free encyclopedia anyone can change. This means we should be concerned with making new articles, or making those that exist better. We are a very small community, to the point that you have probably seen all the regulars when you have been here a week. When we start talking about images, we necessarily need to talk about licenses, the stuff you are allowed to do with images. Can you tell me what the difference is between a GPL-liencensed image and one under one of the Creative Commons licenses? - Personally I am not too interested to know. I want to be able to USE image to illustrate an article, if possible. I want to be able to focus on what is needed to make an article better (for example: easier to understand), rather than battling with image licenses. But there are those people who are fascinated by image licenses, by ensuring the images are used according to what their license specifies. Those guys sit around at Wikimedia Commons. I will therefore leave these decisions to them; and if you think that a given product logo should be in your article, it is in my opinion better to talk to the guys and gals at Commons; they have the resources, we don't. So what was the thing we were supposed to vote on? -- () 20:33, 17 November 2008 (UTC)

If a username does not use Latin characters, where do you report it and how do you tell the user? - 07:49, 16 November 2008 (UTC)

Muskrat

Muskrats are rodents that live in freshwater and saltwater marshes, lakes, ponds, and streams. Muskrats often build dome-shaped houses in marshes. These houses, made of plants, protect the muskrat from predators, since the only entrance is underwater. Some muskrats live in burrows on the water banks. Muskrats are excellent swimmers but are slow on land. 

Muskrats are native to North America, but have been brought to Europe and Asia, where they now live in the wild. Muskrats got their name because they have musk glands that produce a strong scent.

Griffith's experiment

Griffith's experiment, was an experiment done in 1928 by Frederick Griffith. It was one of the first experiments showing that bacteria can get DNA through a process called transformation.

Griffith used two strains of "Pneumococcus". These bacteria infect mice. He used a type III-S (smooth) and type II-R (rough) strain. The III-S strain covers itself with a polysaccharide capsule that protects it from the host's immune system. This means that the host will die. The II-R strain does not have that protective shield around it and is killed by the host's immune system.

In this experiment, bacteria from the III-S strain were killed by heat, and their remains were added to II-R strain bacteria. While neither harmed the mice on their own, the blend of the two was able to kill mice. 

Griffith was also able to get both live II-R and live III-S strains of "pneumococcus" from the blood of these dead mice. He concluded that the type II-R had been "transformed" into the lethal III-S strain by a "transforming principle" that was somehow part of the dead III-S strain bacteria.

Today, we know that the "transforming principle" Griffith saw was the DNA of the III-S strain bacteria. While the bacteria had been killed, the DNA had survived the heating process and was taken up by the II-R strain bacteria. The III-S strain DNA contains the genes that form the shielding polysaccharide part from attack. Armed with this gene, the former II-R strain bacteria were now protected from the host's immune system and could kill the host. 

The exact nature of the transforming principle (DNA) was confirmed in the experiments done by Avery, McLeod and McCarty and by Hershey and Chase.

Frederick Griffith

Frederick Griffith (1879 - 1941) was a British medical officer and geneticist. In 1928, during an experiment, he discovered what he called a "transforming principle", but today we call DNA. 

He was born in Hale, England and attended Liverpool University where he studied genetics. In his younger days he worked for the Liverpool Royal Infirmary, the Thompson Yates Laboratory, and the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis. 

The experiment began when Griffith was trying to make a vaccine to prevent pneumonia infections in the "Spanish flu" influenza pandemic after World War I, by using two strains of the "Streptococcus pneumoniae" bacterium.

Griffith was killed at work in his laboratory in 1941, along with longtime friend and bacteriologist William M. Scott in London during an air raid in the London Blitz. Years later Griffith's "transforming principle" was identified as DNA by Oswald Theodore Avery, along with coworkers Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty, in 1944: the Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment.

Streptococcus pneumoniae

Streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, is a Gram-positive, alpha-hemolytic diplococcus aerotolerant anaerobe and a member of the genus "Streptococcus". An important human pathogen, "S. pneumoniae" was recognized as a major cause of pneumonia in the late 19th century and is the subject of many humoral immunity studies.

Strain (biology)

In biology, strain is a low-level taxonomic rank used in three related ways.

A strain is a genetic variant or subtype of a microorganism, that is to say a virus or bacterium or fungus. For example, a "flu strain" is a certain biological form of the influenza or "flu" virus. Properly speaking, Bacteria, Archaea and viruses do not have species, because they do not have eukaryote-type sexual reproduction. Bacteria do exchange DNA, but they may exchange it between different kinds of bacteria, illustrating their considerable difference from eukaryotes. Strains are therefore an absolutely essential part of bacterial identification. 

In botany, the term is not used to rank plants. It is sometimes used to refer to all the descendants produced from a common ancestor that share a uniform morphological or physiological character. A strain is a designated group of offspring that have descended from a modified plant, produced ether by conventional breeding or by biotechnological means or result from genetic mutation. As an example, some rice strains are made by inserting new genetic material into a rice plant, all the descendants of the genetically modified rice plant are a strain with a unique genetic code that is passed on to later generations; the strain designation, which is normally a number or a formal name, covers all the plants that descent from the originally modified plant. The rice plants in the strain can be breed to other rice strains or cultivars, and if desirable plants are produced, these are further breed to stabilize the desirable traits; the stabilized plants that can be propagated and come true, are given a cultivar name and released into production to be used by farmers.

A mouse or a rat strain is a group of animals that is genetically uniform. Strains are used in laboratory experiments. Mouse strains can be inbred or genetically engineered, while rat strains are usually produced by inbreeding.

Tom Wills

Thomas Wentworth "Tom" Wills (19 August 1835 – 3 May 1880) was an Australian all-round sportsman who helped invent Australian Football, and umpired the first ever game of Australian Football, and helped write the Laws of Australian Football.

Wills was born in south-east New South Wales, Australia either near Gundagai or Queanbeyan. 

From the age of 14 he went to Rugby School in England. At school he played both rugby football and cricket very well. By his final year in England, he was captain of the Rugby XI and he was listed in Bells Sporting Life as being one of the most promising young cricketers in England.

In 1858, Wills created a set of football rules that were like a cross between rugby, soccer and Gaelic football. He made up the game for cricketers to keep in shape during the off-season (winter). Wills had help in making up the game from other people including his cousin Henry Colden Harrison , and W.J. Hammersly and J.B. Thompson. This game is now Australian Rules Football. 

Wills grew up with Indigenous Australians. He spoke the language of the people who lived near him and played with the children. It has been suggested that Australian Rules Football is based in part on "Marn Grook", an Aboriginal game with some similar rules to Australian Rules Football. Because the indigenous people Wills paid with as a child would have played "Marn Grook", Wills would have been influenced by this game when creating the rules for Australian Rules Football.

In 1868, Wills coached the first Australian cricket team to tour England, which was composed entirely of Indigenous Australians.

N-type Semiconductor

N-Type Semiconductor is created by adding pentavalent impurities like Phosphorus (P), Arsenic (As), or Antimony (Sb). The purpose of doing so is to make more charge carriers, or electrons available in the material for conduction. 

Semiconductor materials like Silicon and Germanium have four electrons in their outer shell (valence shell). All the four electrons are used by the semiconductor atom in forming bonds with its neighboring atoms, leaving a low number of electrons available for conduction. Pentavalent elements are those elements which have five electrons in their outer shell. When pentavalent impurities like Phosphorus or Arsenic are added into semiconductor, four electrons form bonds with the surrounding silicon atoms leaving one electron free. The resulting material has a large number of free electrons.
Since electrons are negative charge carriers, the resultant material is called N-type (or negative type) semiconductor. The pentavalent impurity that is added is called 'Dopant' and the process of addition is called 'doping'.

N-Type semiconductor is manufactured by doping 'intrinsic' or pure semiconductor material. The amount of impurity added is very small compared to the amount of semiconductor. Characteristics and nature of the resultant semiconductor can be controlled by controlling the quantity of 'dopant'.

Plug-in hybrid

A plug-in hybrid car is similar to a conventional hybrid vehicle—both use a gasoline engine as well as an electric motor. A plug-in hybrid differs primarily in that it can be plugged in to charge the batteries, while a conventional hybrid relies solely on energy generated from braking, coasting or from the gasoline engine.

However, a plug-in hybrid uses larger battery packs that can be recharged by connecting to common household electricity. Plug-in hybrids can be driven for long distances—from a few miles to as much as 40 miles—without using any gasoline. Plug-in hybrid cars are also known as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles or PHEVs. Plug-in hybrid cars that use a gas engine exclusively for recharging batteries—rather than directly powering the wheels—are also called Extended-Range Electric Vehicles or E-REVs.

Fueling your car with electricity is about 5 times cheaper than fueling it with gasoline. That is like buying gasoline at less than $1 per gallon. It also reduces your greenhouse pollution and helps reduce crude oil imports. Also plug-in hybrids produced substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions than either conventional gasoline cars or unplugged hybrids. The reduction in emissions results from electric operation being much more efficient than gasoline operation. 

Criticisms of the hybrid include the additional cost, weight, and size of a larger battery pack. But The extra weight of the batteries will be offset somewhat by the reduced weight of the gas engine. 

It is obvious for most people that internal combustion engine cars cannot represent the future anymore because of the oil reserves that are estimated to be finished in forty or fifty years. Obviously, Plug-in vehicles cannot be considered a short term option because we lack the needed infrastructure and capable batteries for increasing the autonomy that is currently limited. The general opinion was that, at least for the next seven or eight years, Plug-ins are not going to become the standard in hybrid vehicles and that regular HEVs will have the biggest proportion on the market.

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (or IEEE for short) an international non-profit, professional organization for the advancement of technology related to electricity. It has the most members of any technical professional organization in the world, with more than 400,000 members in more than 160 countries. About 45% of of IEEE's members live outside the United States.

It was formed in 1963 by the merger of the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE, founded 1912) and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE, founded 1884).

The IRE concerned mostly radio engineering. The major interests of the AIEE were wire communications and light and power systems. As technology developing, the IRE and the AIEE became difficult to distinguish. And people who belong to both group were increasing gradually. After World War II, the leadership of both the IRE and the AIEE merged the organizations on January 1, 1963.

IEEE says its purpose is "scientific and educational, directed toward the advancement of the theory and practice of electrical, electronics, communications and computer engineering, as well as computer science, the allied branches of engineering and the related arts and sciences." In pursuing these goals, the IEEE serves a major publisher of scientific journals, provides learning opportunities within the engineering sciences, research, and technology and so on.

IEEE consists of 150 countries, 350,000 members, 39 societies, organized around specialized technical fields, with more than 300 local organizations that hold regular meetings. Famous presidents of IEEE and its founding organizations include Elihu Thomson, Alexander Graham Bell, Ernst Weber. The current (2008) president of IEEE is Lewis M. Terman. 

IEEE produces 30 percent of the world's literature in the electrical and electronics engineering and computer science fields, publishing well over 100 peer-reviewed journals.

The content in these journals as well as the content from several hundred annual conferences are available in the IEEE's online digital library.
IEEE is one of the leading standards-making organizations in the world. The IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA) makes and maintains standards for the IEEE. IEEE standards affect a wide range of industries including: power and energy, biomedical and healthcare, Information Technology (IT), telecommunications, transportation, nanotechnology, information assurance, and many more. In 2005, IEEE had close to 900 active standards, with 500 standards under development. One of the more notable IEEE standards is the IEEE 802 LAN/MAN group of standards which includes the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard and the IEEE 802.11 Wireless Networking standard (Wi-Fi).

<doc id="142542" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142542" title="Galvanometer">
Galvanometer

A galvanometer is a type of ammeter. It is an instrument for detecting and measuring electric current. It is an analog electromechanical transducer that produces a rotary deflection, through a limited arc, in response to electric current flowing through its coil. The term has been expanded to include uses of the same mechanism in recording, positioning, and servomechanism equipment.
The most familiar use is as an analog measuring instrument, often called a meter. It is used to measure the direct current (flow of electric charge) through an electric circuit. The D'Arsonval/Weston form used today is constructed with a small pivoting coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet. The coil is attached to a thin pointer that traverses a calibrated scale. A tiny torsion spring pulls the coil and pointer to the zero position.

When a direct current (DC) flows through the coil, the coil generates a magnetic field. This field acts against the permanent magnet. The coil twists, pushing against the spring, and moves the pointer. The hand points at a scale indicating the electric current. Careful design of the pole pieces ensures that the magnetic field is uniform, so that the angle of the pointer is proportional to the current. A useful meter generally contains provision for damping the mechanical resonance of the moving coil and pointer, so that the pointer settles quickly to its position without oscillation.

A tangent galvanometer is an early measuring instrument used for the measurement of electric current. It works by using a compass needle to compare a magnetic field generated by the unknown current to the magnetic field of the Earth. It gets its name from its operating principle, the tangent law of magnetism, which states that the tangent of the angle a compass needle makes is proportional to the ratio of the strengths of the two perpendicular magnetic fields. It was first described by Claude Servais Mathias Pouillet in 1837.

A tangent galvanometer consists of a coil of insulated copper wire wound on a circular non-magnetic frame. The frame is mounted vertically on a horizontal base provided with levelling screws. The coil can be rotated on a vertical axis passing through its centre. A compass box is mounted horizontally at the centre of a circular scale. It consists of a tiny, powerful magnetic needle pivoted at the centre of the coil. The magnetic needle is free to rotate in the horizontal plane. The circular scale is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant is graduated from 0° to 90°. A long thin aluminium pointer is attached to the needle at its centre and at right angle to it. To avoid errors due to parallax a plane mirror is mounted below the compass needle.

<doc id="142543" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142543" title="Magnetic tape">
Magnetic tape

Magnetic tape a long and narrow strip of plastic that thin magnetic material is coated on. Nearly all recording tape is of this type, whether used for recording audio or video or computer data storage.

Magnetic tape recording uses magnetic tape which moves on a recording head. Electrical signals are fed to the recording head, inducing a pattern of magnetization similar to the signal. A playback head can then pick up the changes in magnetic field from the tape and convert it into an electrical signal.

Devices that record and playback audio and video using magnetic tape are generally called tape recorders and video tape recorders respectively. A device that stores computer data on magnetic tape can be called a tape drive, a tape unit, or a streamer. Autoloaders and tape libraries are frequently used to automate cartridge handling.

Magnetic tape was first invented for recording sound by Fritz Pfleumer in 1928 in Germany. Pfleumer's invention used an iron oxide(FeO) powder coating on a long strip of paper.

Magnetic tape has been used for data storage for over 50 years. In this time, many advances in tape have been made. Modern magnetic tape is most commonly packaged in cartridges and cassettes. 

Today, many other technologies like CD or DVD are replacing magnetic tape. However, innovation in the technology continues and tape is still widely used.

When storing large amounts of data, tape can be cheaper than disk or other data storage options. Tape storage has always been used with large computer systems. Modern usage is a high capacity medium for backups and archives. As of 2008, the highest capacity tape cartridge (Sun StorageTek T10000B) can store 1 TB of data without using compression.

But, magnetic tape has quite a long wait time for random accesses since the deck must wind the tape to move from one data to another. (Magnetic tape data stroage uses Sequential access method.)

Cathode

A cathode is an electrode through which electrons flow into an electrical device such as a battery. In other words, a cathode is a positive electrode on a battery and a negative electrode on an electrolytic cell. Electric current is perceived as flowing in the opposite direction that the electrons are flowing. So electrons go into the + terminal of a battery, but electric current goes out. Electrons go into the - terminal of an electrolytic cell, but electric current goes out.

An electrode through which electrons flows out of the device is termed an anode because it is negatively charged. An anode is a negative electrode on a battery and a positive electrode on an electrolytic cell.

Electrical telegraph

The electrical telegraph is a telegraph that uses electric signals. In general the term electrical telegraph refers to a signalling system where an operator makes and breaks an electrical contact with a telegraph key which results in an audible signal at the other end produced by a telegraph sounder which is interpreted and transcribed by a human.

Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber installed a 1000m long wire above the town's roofs. They were allowed to do this on 6 May 1833. Carl August Steinheil was able to build a telegraph network in 1835-6. He installed a telegraph line along the first German railroad in 1835.

The telegraph had a transmitting device which had a keyboard with 16 black-and-white keys. These served for switching the electric current.
Dr. David Alter created it one year before the much more popular Morse telegraph was invented. Alter demonstrated it publically.

In the United States, the telegraph was developed by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail. Morse created an electrical telegraph in 1837. His version was a design that could transmit over long distances using poor quality wire. Vail, his assistant, developed the Morse code signalling alphabet with Morse.

Knol

Knol is a Google project which aims to include user-written articles on a range of topics. The project was announced on December 13, 2007 and opened in beta to the public on July 23, 2008. When it was opened, there were a few hundred articles mostly about health and medicine.

Knol pages are "meant to be the first thing someone who searches for this topic for the first time will want to read", according to Manber. The term "knol", which Google defines as a "unit of knowledge", refers to both the project and an article in the project. Several experts see Knol as Google's attempt to compete with Wikipedia, while others point out the differences between the projects.

Anyone can create and own new knols. There can also be several articles on the same topic, each written by a different author.
Because multiple articles can have the same title, readers find a topic by searching, rather than just by title. The authors can say who can edit their articles: the public, other authors, or only themselves. They may also choose to include ads from Google's AdSense to their knols. Knol has a policy that specifies topics that are unacceptable for the project. Relevant nudity is allowed (in most countries), but pornography, commercial or otherwise, is forbidden. Also forbidden is discriminatory or violent content. Content designed to promote businesses, products or services is allowed, but articles devoid of substantive content and created solely to generate ad revenue are not.

In its early stages of development as a resource, Knol was criticised very much. Commentators have called it a "wasteland" of articles copied from other sources, entries that were outdated or abandoned, as well as spam or self-promotion. Knol is frequently criticized for having incomplete and inaccurate articles. Google has said that "Since knol authors receive attribution, knols are a great forum for expressing your opinions." In October 2008, Google unveiled using Knols as a forum for debate, and enabled French, Italian and German versions, in the face of stagnating traffic.

Anyone who wants to contribute to Knol must first sign in, with a Google account. The users should give their real names. If permission is given, Google will check if the name is true. Google will do this by credit card or phone. Google "[believes] that knowing who wrote what will significantly help users make better use of web content". The company hopes that "knols will include the opinions and points of view of the authors who will put their reputation on the line".

Readers who are logged in with a google account can comment on entries, rate them or suggest changes. This works much like a blog. When the project was announced, Manber said that "Google will not serve as an editor in any way, and will not bless any content. All editorial responsibilities and control will rest with the authors."

All knols are licensed by default under the Creative Commons CC-BY-3.0 license. This license allows anyone to reuse the material as long as the original author is named, but authors may choose the CC-BY-NC-3.0 license (which prohibits commercial reuse) or traditional "all rights reserved" copyright protections instead. 

Knol has "nofollow" outgoing links, using an HTML directive. This prevents links in its articles from influencing search engine rankings.

People have described Knol as a rival to other encyclopedia sites such as Wikipedia and Scholarpedia. Sometimes people pointed out that the format was very different, and therefore it might be an addition to these sites. It might allow to get around some of the Problems of Wikipedia. The non-profit Wikimedia Foundation, which owns the name Wikipedia and the servers hosting the Wikipedia projects, welcomed the Google Knol initiative saying that "The more good free content, the better for the world." While Wikipedia articles are written collectively under a "neutral point of view" policy,

There has been debate whether Google search results can remain neutral because of possible conflict of interest. According to Danny Sullivan, the editor of "Search Engine Land", "Google’s goal of making Knol pages easy to find on search engines could conflict with its need to remain unbiased." Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, raised similar concerns: "At the end of the day, there's a fundamental conflict between the business Google is in and its social goals.

Problems of Wikipedia

Wikipedia is a very large project that wants to make a free encyclopedia. This encyclopedia is written by volunteers. This approach has been criticised. The main points of criticism are:

Only a certain group of people edit Wikipedia. For this reason, the opinions of that group, and their interests may be covered more in Wikipedia. This is usually called a "system bias", and is a bad thing to have. There are also certain forms of group dynamics that are present. This means that the group of editors as a whole is more occupied to please itself than to edit articles).
Robert McHenry said that Wikipedia should not call itself an encyclopedia. He thinks that this word also means that there is a degree of authority and accountability and that a resource anyone can change cannot have this. McHenry argues that
Orlowski often criticized Wikipedia. In December 2005, he wrote on an OpEd at "The Register":

A number of academics – such as Sarah Deutch, dean of social sciences and professor of history at Duke University, and Margaret Humphries, professor of history and associate clinical professor of medicine at Duke – have criticized Wikipedia for its perceived failure as a reliable source. A related if somewhat "ad hominem" criticism is that many Wikipedia editors do not have degrees or other credentials generally recognized in academia. The use of Wikipedia is not accepted in many schools and universities in writing a formal paper. Several educational institutions have blocked Wikipedia in the past while others have limited its use to only a pointer to external sources. University of Maryland professor of physics Robert L. Park has characterized Wikipedia as a target for "purveyors of pseudoscience."

Some academic journals do refer to Wikipedia articles, but they do not do this the same way as traditional references. For example, Wikipedia articles have been referenced in "enhanced perspectives" provided on-line in the journal "Science". The first of these perspectives to provide a hyperlink to Wikipedia was "A White Collar Protein Senses Blue Light," Dozens of enhanced perspectives have provided such links since then. The publisher of "Science" says that these enhanced perspectives "include hypernotes - which link directly to websites of other relevant information available online - beyond the standard bibliographic references."

Some librarians, academics, and editors of other encyclopedias consider it to have little utility as a reference work. Most university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary sources. One university program and several schools have even banned Wikipedia citations specifically. 

Wikipedia's policies state that assertions should be supported by reliable, published sources—ideally, by peer reviewed publications. Jimmy Wales, the "de facto" leader of Wikipedia, stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate as primary sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative.

A rechargeable battery, or a storage battery, is a kind of battery that can be restored to full charge by the use of electrical energy. It is also called Secondary cell because people recharged it with Primary cell when there was no generator.

Rechargeable battery, compared with disposable battery, has many environmental and economical advantages, because it can be discharged and recharged many times. But it costs more to produce and contains more toxic chemicals than a disposable battery.

Rechargeable batteries are used for many mobile machines, like MP3 player, portable media player, mobile phone, electronic dictionary, etc.

2005 Pacific hurricane season

The 2005 Pacific hurricane season was a slightly inactive season that produced 17 tropical cyclones. It officially started on May 15 and ended on November 30, dates which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the northeast Pacific Ocean. The first tropical cyclone, Hurricane Adrian, developed on May 17, while the last storm Tropical Depression Sixteen-E, dissipated on October 20. During the year, a total of 17 tropical cyclones, 15 tropical storms, 7 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes formed. The most intense hurricane, Hurricane Kenneth remained out over open waters for the duration of its existence. However, the remnants of the storm caused minor flooding on the Island of Hawaii. September was the most active month of the year, as 6 of the 17 tropical cyclones formed during this time. 

The pre-season forecast from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration called for 11-15 named storms and 6-8 hurricanes, of which 2-4 were expected to attain major hurricane status.

Very few storms impacted land throughout the season. Hurricane Adrian was the only landfalling system. It struck El Salvador as a dissipating tropical depression after rapidly weakening from hurricane status. Flooding in Nicaragua caused the only fatality during the season. Tropical Storm Dora and Hurricane Hilary brought tropical storm force winds to coastal Mexico, although no damage was reported. The remnants Tropical Depression One-C caused heavy rainfall on the Island of Hawaii, peaking at 8.8 in (223.52 mm). Hawaii was also affected by the remnants of Hurricane Kenneth which also caused heavy rains on the Island of Hawaii. The combined storms caused very little damage and only one fatality.

2007 Pacific hurricane season

The 2007 Pacific hurricane season was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation. It officially started on May 15, 2007 in the eastern Pacific, designated as the area east of 140°W, and on June 1 2007 in the central Pacific, which is between the International Date Line and 140°W, and lasted until November 30, 2007. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Pacific basin.

The season began slowly; through the end of July, the seasonal ACE was the third lowest since the geostationary satellite era began in 1966. The inactivity continued through the next month, which was the third quietest August in terms of ACE since reliable records began in the basin in 1971. Tropical Storm Barbara in June caused $55 million (2007 USD) in crop damage in southeastern Mexico from heavy precipitation. In August, Hurricane Flossie formed in the Eastern Pacific and crossed into the Central Pacific, threatening Hawaii but causing little damage. In early September, Hurricane Henriette dropped heavy rainfall in southwest Mexico, which caused nine fatalities and $25 million (2007 USD) in damage.

No names were retired in 2007.

Klingon language

The Klingon language (named "tlhIngan Hol" in Klingon) is a language that was made for the Klingons in the "Star Trek" universe. It is an invented language. This means that there is no country that uses the language. Only few people can really speak the Klingon language. The Klingon Language Institute helps people learn Klingon.

The first Klingon words were made by the actor James Doohan in 1979 for the . When they made the third movie in 1984, Gene Roddenberry wanted to have a real language for the Klingons. So it was the linguist (a language scientist) Marc Okrand who made the Klingon language. He has written some books about the Klingon language.

The Klingon language feels like talking backwards. Marc Okrand wanted the language to be as complicated as possible. He did this to make it sound very extraterrestrial. The word order in a sentence is always object-verb-subject. So the English sentence "I see the cat" is said as "the cat see I" in Klingon.

This language uses many syllables that are attached to the word:
When writing in Klingon, some letters are always in uppercase and some are lowercase. This never changes because the letters are spoken differently when they are written differently. This is the Klingon alphabet:

Things commonly added include garlic, cumin, and lemon juice. Sometimes croutons are added to make it look good.

Lentil soup is mentioned in the Bible: In Genesis 25:34, Esau is prepared to give up his birthright for a pot of fragrant red lentil soup being cooked by his brother, Jacob. 

The ancient Greek dramatist, Aristophanes, mentions lentil soup in his plays: He describes it as the "sweetest of delicacies."

Lentil soup was once a food for the poor. Today, it is recognized as highly nutritious and provides a good source of protein, fiber, iron and potassium.

Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Matilda

"Ended: December 1 2008" 

Nomination by (): Hello, I would like to present to the community , a contributer to the Simple English Wikipedia for now three months and administrator on the and , for . Matilda has shown a great dedication to contributing to our project in the last three months, and I think she would make a fantastic administrator for Simple English Wikipedia. She has served as an administrator on the English Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons—two important wikis—so she obviously has experience as an administrator already. There shouldn't be any problem at all with Matilda as an administrator here on Simple English Wikipedia. If there was, why would I be nominating her now?

Matilda has done a great deal of work already for Simple English Wikipedia in the last three months. Matilda has amassed over 1300 edits in her three months of activity here. She has made approxamently 20 tags to pages. I've taken my time to check all of them, and they are "all" accurate. Obviously, she would be using the deletion tool to good use as an administrator. She has also made about five reports. It may not be much... but we don't get "that" much vandalism, so I consider that a fair amount in only three months of activity. She would use the block tool to good use also. She even has done some substantial article work around Simple English Wikipedia, having over 600 of her edits in the mainspace. That's nearly half of her edits in the mainspace! Not only does she care about the maintenance side of Wikipedia, she cares about the articles we're here to contribute to. Her civility level is just fine when communicating with others. She has participated in discussion pages such as , , , , , and several user and article talk pages, which have all been contructive. 

Overall, Matilda would do just fine as an administrator for Simple English Wikipedia. I think Matilda is one of our best candidates for adminship. Matilda would do very positive tasks with the tools. Matilda would only be beneficial to our Wikipedia community. She has all the good traits of an administrator for our project, and most of all, I trust her with the tools and as an administrator for Simple English Wikipedia. Hopefully, the community agrees with me. Thank you. – () 03:38, 23 November 2008 (UTC)
Co nomination from Synergy:Greetings fellow editors. I am here today to present Matilda for adminship. Over time I have found her to be helpful, cordial and understanding. Yet, although I have not always agreed with her, I "trust" her to make the right decisions with the extra buttons and not abuse them. Not just for our articles but for the communities needs and wishes. I hope you feel the same. :) 03:43, 23 November 2008 (UTC)
Co-Nomination by    : My statement will NOT be as long as Ryan's but here It is. I belive Matilda is the first person to really deserve it since I supported . I think she would make a great admin. That's my statement.--    03:48, 23 November 2008 (UTC)

Co-Nomination by : Another short and sweet one from me, I first encountered Matilda through the DYK? process, where her input has been monumental in taking the project forwards. Although we did occasionally clash over a difference in opinion, it was always in a calm manner, and I believe that Matilda possesses all the qualities needed in a wiki administrator. 14:25, 24 November 2008 (UTC)

"Candidate's acceptance:"
I accept the nomination and am very humbled by the kind words in the nominations above. I am happy to answer any questions people may have of me about this nomination. -- () 21:04, 24 November 2008 (UTC)


I am wary of giving the flag to Matilda here. She seems cold and disinterested on some of the pages she edits (notably ) and cannot resolve agreements easily (shown by her comments on her talk page about reading ease, DYK nominations, various comments on Simple Talk and on my own talk page). Whether or not these issues are due to inability to work well with a small community (admin on ENWP and Commons = big communities) or even a dogmatic personality, it is a trait needed to resolve arguments quickly when wishing to become an administrator.

Her edit count is also worrisome, but not very. Many edits are to "Wikipedia_talk:", "Wikipedia:" and "talk:" pages justifying what I have said above about lengthy arguments without clean, quick resolutions. Her mainspace edits are rather low (51%), however, they are quality edits and generally, quality comes before quantity. -- 21:44, 24 November 2008 (UTC)

I would vote Neutral if we could. Matilda seems to be diligent at working, but my gut says differently... 01:54, 25 November 2008 (UTC)


Hello all, when you have made up your mind on whether to support Matilda or oppose her and vote, please keep in mind that a vote that gives a reason (other than "me too") is more helpful to the closing 'crat that one that does not. So please help our friendly crats by stating why you vote the way you do, even though your choice may seem obvious. It will make their lives easier, esp. in the case of a close-call. Thanks. -- () 11:24, 25 November 2008 (UTC)

Mikhail Vasilyevich Nesterov () (, Ufa – October 18, 1942, Moscow) was a Russian painter. He was a very important painter for religious Symbolism in Russian art. He studied under Pavel Tchistyakov at the Imperial Academy of Arts. Later, he felt attracted to the group of artists known as the Peredvizhniki. His canvas "The Vision of the Youth Bartholomew" (1890–91) is often considered to mark the inauguration of the Russian Symbolist movement. This painting shows the conversion of Sergii Radonezhsky. From 1890 to 1910, Nesterov lived in Kiev and St Petersburg, working on frescoes in St. Vladimir's Cathedral and the Church on Spilt Blood, respectively. After 1910, he spent the rest of his life in Moscow, working in the Marfo-Mariinsky Convent. As a devout Orthodox Christian, he did not accept the Bolshevik Revolution but remained in Russia until his death, painting the portraits of Ivan Ilyin, Ivan Pavlov, Otto Schmidt, and Vera Mukhina, among others.

Manichaeism

Manichaeism (in Modern Persian "Āyin e Māni") was one of the major Iranian Gnostic religions. Originally it came from Sassanid Persia. Most of the original writings of the founding prophet Mani (Syriac, , c. AD 210–276) have been lost, but many translations and fragmentary texts have survived. Manichaeism was big between the third and seventh centuries. At its height it was one of the most widespread religions in the world. Manichaean churches and scriptures existed as far east as China and as far west as the Roman Empire. Manichaeism appears to have died out before the sixteenth century in southern China.

The original six sacred books of Manichaeism were written in Syriac Aramaic. They were soon translated into other languages to help spread the religion. As they spread to the east, the Manichaean writings passed through Middle Persian, Parthian, Sogdian, and ultimately Uyghur and Chinese translations. As they spread to the west, they were translated into Greek, Coptic, and Latin. The spread and success of Manichaeism were seen as a threat to other religions, and it was widely persecuted in Christian, Zoroastrian, and later, Islamic areas.

Aberdeenshire () is the name of both a county and of one of the 32 unitary council areas in Scotland. The two are not the same area.

Aberdeenshire stretches from the east coast of Scotland up into the mountains. It is between Kincardineshire and Angus (south) and Banffshire (west). Aberdeen is the county town.

Aberdeenshire is mainly countryside and mountain, except in Aberdeen. Aberdeen is one of Britain's richest towns because it serves the North Sea oil rigs.

Fraserburgh is a large fishing port.

The Aberdeenshire council area takes in the historic counties of Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire and half of Banffshire. It does not include Aberdeen City though, which is a Council Area in its own right. However, Aberdeenshire Council does have its headquarters at Woodhill House, in Aberdeen; the only Scottish council whose headquarters are based outwith its area's border.

Aberdeenshire borders Angus and Perth and Kinross to the south, and Highland and Moray to the west.

<doc id="142773" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142773" title="Niobe">
Niobe

In Greek mythology, Niobe (Νιόβη) was the daughter of the semi-legendary ruler Tantalus, called the "Phrygian" and sometimes even as "King of Phrygia" Tantalus ruled in Sipylus, a city located at the western end of Anatolia. The city has the same name than the mountain on which it was founded (Mount Sipylus) and of which few traces remain, and not in the traditional heartland of Phrygia lying more inland and centered around Gordion. Niobe was an Anatolian princess. She married Amphion of Thebes and Greek mythology was a vehicle for her historical record mixed with legends. Niobe was the sister of Pelops, who gave his name to the Peloponnese.

According to the Greek myth, Niobe boasted of her superiority to Leto because the goddess only had two children, the twins Apollo and Artemis, while Niobe had fourteen children (the Niobids), seven male and seven female. Her famously quoted speech which caused the indignation of the goddess is as follows: 
Artemis killed Niobe's daughters and Apollo killed Niobe's sons as they practiced athletics, with the last begging for his life. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions at least one Niobid was spared, (usually Meliboea). Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo for swearing revenge. A devastated Niobe fled to Mount Sipylus (Spil Mount) of Lydia in Anatolia and was turned into a stone waterfall as she wept unceasingly. Spil Mount has a natural rock formation resembling a female face claimed to be Niobe, not to be confused with a sculpture carved into the rock-face of nearby crag Coddinus, north of Spil Mount, probably representing Cybele and attributed by the locals to Broteas, the ugly brother of Niobe. The rock formation is also known as the "Weeping Stone", as the stone is said to have wept tears during the summer. The rock appears to weep because it is porous limestone and rainwater seeps through the pores. 

There are various accounts about how and where Niobe perished; the story that returns Niobe from Thebes to her Lydian homeland is recorded in "Bibliotheke" 3.46.

The story of Niobe is an ancient one among Greeks: Niobe is mentioned by Achilles to Priam in Homer's "Iliad" book XXIV, as a stock type for mourning. Priam is like Niobe in that he is grieving for his son Hector, who was killed and not buried for several days. Niobe is also mentioned in Sophocles'
"Antigone": as she is marched toward her death, Antigone compares her own loneliness to that of Niobe. The "Niobe" of Aeschylus, set in Thebes, survives in fragmentary quotes that were supplemented by a papyrus sheet containing twenty-one lines of text. From the fragments it appears that for the first part of the tragedy the grieving Niobe sits veiled and silent. Sophocles too contributed a "Niobe" that is lost. Furthermore, the conflict between Niobe and Leto is mentioned in one of Sappho's poetic fragments, ("Before they were mothers, Leto and Niobe had been the most devoted of friends.") The subject of Niobe and the destruction of the Niobids was part of the repertory of Attic vase-painters and inspired sculpture groups and wall frescoes as well as relief carvings on Roman sarcophagi. 

Niobe's iconic tears were also mentioned in Hamlet's soliloquy (Act 1, Scene 2), in which he contrasts his mother's grief over the dead King, Hamlet's father — "like Niobe, all tears" —
to her unseemly hasty marriage to Claudius.

Binturong

The binturong ("Arctictis binturong") is a large, rare mammal that lives in trees in the dense forests of southeast Asia. The binturong is also often called a bearcat because it looks like both a bear and a cat.

Binturongs have thick, black fur, a long, muscular tail, and long, stiff, white whiskers. They use their prehensile tail almost like another hand; young binturongs can even hang by their tail. Binturongs grow to be up to about 5 feet (1.5 m) long. Like other civets, the binturongs use scent marks to communicate with other binturongs. In captivity, binturongs live for about 30 years.

Binturongs eat fruit and small animals that they find using their sense of smell to find food. They hunt for food at night - they are nocturnal.

1996 Pacific hurricane season

The 1996 Pacific hurricane season was an event in tropical cyclone formation and the second least active Pacific hurricane season in recorded history, behind only 1977. It officially began May 15, 1996 in the eastern north Pacific and on June 1, 1996 in the central north Pacific. It ended on November 30, 1996. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.

Few notable storms formed this season, however it was very eventful. Twelve tropical cyclones formed during this season, of which five made landfall and two other impacted land areas. Two tropical cyclones that formed in other basins entered the eastern north Pacific Ocean. Early in the season three tropical cyclones impacted Mexico in a ten day span, while the first cyclone of the season formed before it officially began. Hurricane Douglas was the strongest storm, reaching Category 4 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale and had its beginnings in the Atlantic as Hurricane Douglas.
Alma was the first of three consecutive storms to come close to, or make landfall on, the Pacific coast of Mexico during a ten day span. Alma killed at least three people, and possibly twenty. Three were killed when a house near Lazaro Cardenas collapsed. There were unconfirmed reports that 17 people were killed by floods in Puebla from rains related to Alma. Trees were downed and power was knocked out to many places. Roads were flooded and covered with Debris.
Hurricane Boris was the second consecutive storm to approach close to Mexico. It made landfall halfway between Acapulco and Lazaro Cardenas on June 29. It killed ten people. A flood caused by Boris on the San Jeronimo River left thousands homeless.
Cristina was the third cyclone to come close to Mexico in the space of ten days. It killed a fisherman when his boat was caught at sea off Oaxaca. At least 11 other fishing boats and 22 people were missing. Their fate is unknown.
Hurricane Douglas was a continuation of Atlantic Hurricane Cesar, which crossed Central America. Continuing Cesar's nearly due-west heading, it was still a tropical storm when it entered the Pacific on July 29, and quickly regained hurricane status. 

Douglas's strengthened over the next two days as it turned west-northwest, paralleling the coast of Mexico. It reached its peak intensity on August 1,with winds of 135 mph (215 km/h) and a central pressure of 946 millibars, making it the strongest hurricane of the season. It slow weakening began on August 2 as it entered cooler waters, and it officially dissipated on August 6, though like many Pacific hurricanes, a remnant circulation could be tracked westward for several days afterward. 

The precursor disturbance to Fausto was first noticed over Venezuela as early as August 31, and may have been related to the tropical wave that spawned Hurricane Fran. By September 4 the wave had crossed Central America into the Pacific; it steadily organized until it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fausto on September 10. 

Fausto intensified rapidly after it reached hurricane intensity on the 12th, peaking with sustained winds of 120 mph (190 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 955 millibars. The hurricane weakened as an approaching trough increased shear over the storm; this same trough also turned the storm north on the 13th, where it made landfall as a minimal hurricane Baja California that day. On September 14, the storm turned northeastward across the Gulf of California, and dissipated inland over the Sierra Madre range after its second landfall as a hurricane. Its extratropical remnants flared up briefly over northern Mexico and Texas, but otherwise soon lost their identity.

Damage in Mexico was relatively minor, with only a single casualty caused by a downed power line.
Hurricane Hernan made landfall in a thinly-populated region of Mexico. It washed out roads, and knocked down power lines and telephone poles. There were 100 injuries but no deaths.

2002 Pacific hurricane season

The 2002 Pacific hurricane season was an event in tropical cyclone meteorology. The most notable storm this year was Hurricane Kenna, which reached Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. It made landfall near Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico, on October 25. It killed four people and was one of the most powerful hurricanes to ever strike the western coast of Mexico. Elsewhere, Tropical Storm Julio made landfall in Mexico, and Tropical Storm Boris dumped torrential rain along the Mexican coast, although it remained offshore. 

Other storms were individually unusual. Hurricanes Elida and Hernan also reached Category 5 intensity, but neither did any damage. Hurricane Fausto, while it had no effect on land, regenerated into a tiny tropical storm at a very high latitude.

It officially started May 15, 2002, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 2002, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 2002. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.

There were twelve tropical storms in the eastern Pacific Ocean this season. Of those, six became hurricanes and five became major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 or high on the Saffir Simpson Scale. A record three Category 5 storms formed. In the central Pacific, one tropical storm, one hurricane, and one major hurricane formed. The season saw below average activity in terms of the number of systems, but above average activity in terms of stronger storms. This was due to a moderately strong El Niño that also suppressed activity in the Atlantic Ocean.

Also of note this season is an unusual gap in storm formation during the first three weeks of August. That time usually sees several nameable storms, but for some reason there were none.

On June 8, an area of disturbed weather that had absorbed a tropical wave spawned Tropical Depression Two-E. It became a tropical storm the next day. After peaking on June 9, steering currents collapsed and Boris stalled out in the ocean between two ridges of high pressure. Shear increased, and the cyclone weakened to a depression on June 10. The next day, Boris degenerated into a remnant low. The remnant drifted east and then southeast before dissipating on June 12.

Boris dumped heavy rains on sections of the Mexican coast. Several homes at an unspecified location were damaged. There were no deaths.

An area of convection and disturbed weather possibly related to outflow from Hurricane Isidore developed a circulation on September 23 and organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen-E on September 25. The depression headed northward and strengthened into a tropical storm the same day. Julio turned to the northwest and peaked just before landfall near Lazaro Cardenas on September 26. The storm quickly dissipated over Mexico.

No one was killed by Julio. Around 100 houses in Acapulco and Zihuatanejo were damaged or washed away by flash flooding.

A powerful Category 5 hurricane at its peak, the third of the season, Kenna made landfall on Mexico as a Category 4. As of 2005, it is the most recent Pacific hurricane to have its name retired.

Kenna killed four people in Mexico and left thousands homeless. Its total damage was from 5 to 100 million dollars.
Eleven-E threatened land. It resulted in warnings and watches being issued for parts of the Baja California Peninsula, but it weakened to a remnant low before strengthening into a storm. No deaths or damages were reported. Eleven-E was the final storm of the season. It lasted for two days in November and dissipated on the sixteenth day of that month.

1994 Pacific hurricane season

The 1994 Pacific hurricane season officially started on May 15, 1994 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1994 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1994. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.

Of note in this season is an unusual spree of very intense storms. Hurricanes Emilia, Gilma, John, and Olivia all reached a pressure below 930 millibars. Elsewhere, Hurricane Rosa killed several people in Mexico.

This season had slightly above average activity. Five hurricanes reached Category 2 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. In addition, there were four other hurricanes and eight tropical storms. In the Central Pacific, two tropical storms and one hurricane formed.

Hurricane Emilia was a powerful Category 4 storm. It briefly threatened the Hawaiian Islands near peak strength, but instead encountered wind shear and weakened. There was minor damage to roofs and some downed trees, and moderate rainfall.

Hurricane Gilma was the strongest storm of the season, and the first Category 5 storm in the East Pacific since Ava in 1973. It is also the strongest July storm in the east Pacific, and is the fifth strongest overall.

Hurricane John was the longest lasting and most continuous tropical cyclone on Earth in recorded history. Its life began on August 11 south of Mexico, and 31 days later the storm became extratropical south of Alaska, after reaching Category 5 strength and passing the International Date Line twice. John caused $15 million (1994 USD) in damage on Johnston Island.

An area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression on August 9 while located 740 miles (1190 km) southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. The depression moved westward without organizing, and dissipated on the 14th. Moisture from the system produced heavy rainfall over the island of Hawaii, totaling to over 15 inches. The flooding closed all major roads in Hilo, and was considered the worst flooding in 40 years. The rainfall destroyed 2 homes and damaged 214, 14 severely. It also damaged roads and businesses. Damage throughout the island totaled to $5 million (1993 USD). Flooding occurred in Maui as well, where landslides blocked portions of the Hana Highway. 

Hurricane Olivia was the second strongest storm of the season. It is one of the ten most intense east Pacific hurricanes ever recorded. At the time, it was the strongest October storm.

An area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression at midday on October 8. It had trouble organizing, and advisories were discontinued for a while. The cyclone finally became a tropical storm on October 11 and was named Rosa. It moved glacially, but eventually a trough steered Rosa north and then northeast. Rosa intensified quickly, peaking at Category 2 intensity just before landfall near La Concepcion on the morning of October 14. Rosa quickly decayed over the mountains of Mexico, and its cloud shield rapidly accelerated northward through the Plains and Mississippi Valley, moistening the atmosphere enough in Texas ahead of a slow moving occluded cyclone to help set the stage for a significant flood event in east Texas on the October 17.

Four deaths, two in each of Nayarit and Durango, were reported. Four people were missing in Sinaloa. More than 100,000 people had their homes damaged in Nayarit. Telephone poles and power lines were downed in Sinaloa. Rain caused landslides and flash-flooding in mountainous areas.

Hurricane John (1994)

Hurricane John was the longest-lived tropical cyclone ever observed, tracking from the Eastern Pacific to the Western Pacific and crossing back to the Central Pacific for 31 days total.

The precursor to Hurricane John was a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on July 25th. It moved across the unfavorable Atlantic, and reached the Eastern Pacific on August 8th. It slowly organized, and became Tropical Depression 10-E on August 11th, 300 nautical miles south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Conditions were not ideal for development, but it developed banding features and well-defined outflow, and managed to strengthen to become Tropical Storm John later that day.

A strong ridge of high pressure over the Northeastern Pacific Ocean forced John westward, where upper level shear kept John a tropical storm as its intensity fluctuated. The shear greatly lessened greatly on the 19th, and John became a hurricane on the 20th. Later that day, it became a major hurricane, and crossed into the Central Pacific shortly thereafter.

Hurricane John continued to strengthen, and reached a peak of 150 knots (175 mph winds) on the 23rd, passing 300 nautical miles south of Hawaii. John had posed a threat to the island days before, but the ridge of high pressure pushed John safely south of the island. The hurricane still caused heavy waves and rains, though. During these days, John's intensity was constantly checked by Air Force Reserve aircraft reconnaissance.

John turned more northerly, where it steadily weakened to a minimal hurricane on the 26th. Then, it crossed just north of Johnston Island, where it caused moderate damage. Conditions again favored strengthening, and John re-strengthened to a 135 mph Category 4 hurricane, but upper level shear again weakened it. John crossed the International Date Line, and became Typhoon John.

The system continued to weaken, becoming a tropcial storm on the 31st and a tropical depression on the 2nd while drifting eastward. John looped back to the northwest, and gradually restrengthened. An upper trough pulled the storm to the northeast on the 7th, and re-entered the Central Pacific on the 8th. John became a hurricane again late on the 8th, and retained that intensity for another day. Upper level shear weakened the hurricane to a tropical storm on the 10th, and John became extratropical in the North Central Pacific about a thousand miles south of Unalaska Island. John dissipated later that day, after an unprecedented 31 days at sea.

Hurricane–Typhoon Paka

Hurricane Paka (international designation: "9728", JTWC designation: "05C", PAGASA designation: Rubing, also known as " Typhoon Paka") was the last tropical cyclone in the 1997 Pacific hurricane and typhoon season, and was among the strongest Pacific typhoons in the month of December. Paka, which is the Hawaiian name for Pat, developed on November 28 from a trough well to the southwest of Hawaii. The storm tracked generally westward for much of its duration, and on December 7 it crossed into the western Pacific Ocean. Much of its track was characterized by fluctuations in intensity, and on December 10 the cyclone attained typhoon status as it crossed the Marshall Islands. On December 16, Paka struck Guam and Rota with winds of 230 km/h (145 mph), and it strengthened further to reach peak winds on December 18 over open waters. Subsequently, it underwent a steady weakening trend, and on December 23 Paka dissipated.

Typhoon Paka first impacted the Marshall Islands, where it dropped heavy rainfall and left $80 million in damage (1997 USD, $100 million 2007 USD). Later, it passed just north of Guam, where strong winds destroyed about 1,500 buildings and damaged 10,000 more; 5,000 people were left homeless, and the island experienced a complete power outage following the typhoon. Damage on the island totaled $500 million (1997 USD, $645 million 2007 USD), which warranted the retirement of its name. Paka also caused light damage in the Northern Marianas Islands, and overall the storm caused no reported deaths.

Pauline then made landfall, slamming into Mexico. Heavy rains and high winds caused damage as the storm skirted the coast.
There were 300-400 deaths, and heavy damage to Acalpulco.

Hurricane Linda (1997)

Hurricane Linda of 1997 was the strongest hurricane ever seen in the east Pacific, with continued winds of 160 knots and gusting to 190 knots, and a central pressure of 900 mbar. It was part of an abnormally active season for both the Eastern and Western Pacific Basins.

Since it was far from land, it did not cause much damage.

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 24th. It moved across the unfavorable Atlantic without development. As it crossed Central America convection increased, and a poorly-defined center developed early on September 9th. Banding and convection increased, and it became a tropical depression that night, 400 nautical miles south of Manzanillo, Mexico.

Tropical Depression 14-E continued northwestward, and became a tropical storm on the 10th. Linda started to intensify more quickly, becoming a hurricane on the 11th 475 nautical miles south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California. After 30 hours of rapidly intensifying, Linda reached her peak of 160 knots on the 12th, or around 185 M.P.H. winds. That is an increase of 95 knots, and a drop of 85 millibars. Linda moved directly over Socorro Island on the 12th as a Category 5 hurricane, but cooler waters weakened it greatly, dissipating it on the 17th.

Linda went over Soccoro Island, doing $3.2 million in damage.

In California, Linda was responsible for 8 deaths and $68 million in damage. Five people drowned in a jetty. Floods caused 3 deaths and mudslides destroyed millions of homes and caused $68 million in damage. The Southwest would get devastated again by Hurricane Nora weeks later.

Hurricane Ioke

Hurricane Ioke (also Typhoon Ioke, international designation 0612, JTWC designation 01C also sometimes called Super Typhoon Ioke) is the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Central Pacific. The first storm to form in the Central Pacific in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season, Ioke is a long-lived and extremely powerful storm that traversed the Pacific, reaching Category 5 status twice as a hurricane. As a typhoon, Ioke managed to achieve Category 5-equivalent one-minute sustained winds one more time before weakening.

Ioke did not affect any permanently populated areas in the Central Pacific or Western Pacific basins as a hurricane or a typhoon, but the storm passed over Johnston Atoll as a Category 2 hurricane and Wake Island as a Category 5 typhoon. Despite its strength, Ioke only caused moderate damage to Wake Island, and was not responsible for any fatalities.

The system began in the third week of August as a persistent tropical disturbance south of the Hawaiian Islands. It was initially embedded in a trough, but gained convection and developed into a tropical depression about 775 miles south of Honolulu on August 19. It continued to strengthen, and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center designated the system with the name "Ioke" (IPA /iːˈəʊ.keɪ/), which is Hawaiian for the name Joyce, becoming the first tropical storm to form in the Central Pacific since 2002. 

Ioke quickly began to enter a process of rapid development; strengthening into a hurricane just 24 hours after it had formed. While safely avoiding the Hawaiian Islands, it continued to rapidly intensify and became a major hurricane (Category 3 or greater) on the morning of August 21. Later that day, Ioke intensified even further into a Category 4 hurricane. On August 22, it began to weaken as a result of cooler water and eyewall replacement cycles, and was downgraded back to a Category 2. As a Category 2 storm, Ioke affected Johnston Atoll.
The storm began to rapidly deepen again late on August 23 as it moved over increasingly warm water, reaching major hurricane status for the second time while moving to the west-northwest. From there, conditions would become even more favorable for development.

Overnight between August 24 and August 25, Ioke strengthened rapidly, becoming a Category 5 hurricane on the 25th - the first system originating from the Central Pacific to reach that intensity while still in the Western Hemisphere. Ioke then began to travel over a large environment highly favorable for hurricane development, and would maintain its strength for an extended period of time. Ioke also became the most intense hurricane ever to develop in the Central Pacific, with a central pressure of 921 mbar (27.19 inHg) at that point (which dropped to 920 mbar at its Central Pacific peak).

Ioke began to fluctuate in intensity afterward; weakened back to a Category 4 while undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, regaining Category 5 strength on August 26. Ioke held that intensity until crossing the International Date Line that evening (August 27 after the crossover), becoming Typhoon Ioke in the process. The storm weakened to Category 4 strength according to the JTWC, but by 2100 UTC on August 29, the JTWC advised that Ioke had regained Category 5 strength for the third time.

After maintaining Category 5 strength for 12 hours, Ioke weakened back to a Category 4 for the final time on August 30 while approaching Wake Island. Ioke passed almost directly over the island on early September 1 and continued tracking to the west-northwest while slowly weakening over gradually cooling waters. On September 3, under the influence of an approaching trough, the typhoon began to recurve to the northwest, then to the north and away from Japan, while weakening more rapidly. Ioke began to transition into an extratropical storm late on September 4 due to increased wind shear and rapidly cooling seas, and the JTWC issued its last advisory at 1200 UTC on September 5 after it was decided that Ioke had begun extratropical transition. The JMA followed suit early on September 7 after Ioke had become completely extratropical east of the Kamchatka Peninsula.

The remnant extratropical low is currently monitored by National Weather Service and is expected to be near Alaska in 48 hours.


Despite Ioke's extreme intensity and impacting two small land masses, damage was surprisingly moderate. Little damage was done on Johnston Atoll, and damage to infrastructure on Wake Island was less than expected, despite Ioke's eyewall brushing the island.

The National Weather Service reported that the eastern eyewall of Ioke passed over the uninhabited Johnston Atoll , buffeting it with hurricane-force winds. 

Twelve people on a United States Air Force vessel in the Pacific were forced to abandon ship and take shelter in a hurricane-proof bunker on the island. They were reported safe the next day, and a reconnaissance flight reported little damage on the island.

Due to Typhoon Ioke's projected path near Wake Island, all 188 people who live and work there were evacuated in two C-17 Globemaster IIIs to Oahu in Hawaii. The typhoon's powerful winds, estimated to gust as high as 190 mph, damaged weather sensors on the island, causing them to fail after the instruments reported a 100 mph gust. A reconnaissance mission by the Coast Guard indicated the typhoon caused moderate damage on the island, including blown off roofs, damaged sides of buildings, and downed trees. However, the damage was repairable, and the major infrastructure on the island was intact.

The JMA issued evacuation orders for its staff on Minami Torishima on September 1 in view of the approaching typhoon, but so far, no damage has been reported.

<doc id="142930" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142930" title="Closure (computer science)">
Closure (computer science)

In Computer science, a closure is a function that has an environment of its own. Inside this environment, there is at least one bound variable. Closures were first used in programming languages such as ML and Lisp.

Closures keep the state of their bound variables over several invocations.

The term closure is often mistakenly used to mean anonymous function. This is probably because most languages implementing anonymous functions allow them to form closures and programmers are usually introduced to both concepts at the same time. These are however different concepts.

The concept of closures was developed in the 1960s and was first fully implemented as a language feature in the programming language Scheme. Since then, many languages have been designed to support closures.

Function objects are sometimes also called closures.
Closures typically appear in languages in which functions are first-class values—in other words, such languages allow functions to be passed as arguments, returned from function calls, bound to variable names, etc., just like simpler types such as strings and integers. For example, consider the following Scheme function:
In this example, the lambda expression codice_1 appears within the function codice_2. When the lambda expression is evaluated, Scheme creates a closure consisting of the code for the lambda and a reference to the codice_3 variable, which is a free variable inside the lambda.

The closure is then passed to the codice_4 function, which calls it repeatedly to determine which books are to be added to the result list and which are to be discarded. Because the closure itself has a reference to codice_3, it can use that variable each time codice_4 calls it. The function codice_4 itself might be defined in a completely separate file.

Here is the same example rewritten in ECMAScript (JavaScript), another popular language with support for closures:
The codice_8 keyword is used here instead of codice_9, and an codice_10 method instead of a global codice_4 function, but otherwise the structure and the effect of the code are the same.

A function may create a closure and return it. The following example is a function that returns a function.

In Scheme:
In ECMAScript:

Because the closure in this case outlives the scope of the function that creates it, the variables codice_12 and codice_13 live on after the function codice_14 returns. In languages without closures, the lifetime of a local variable coincides with the execution of the scope where that variable is declared. In languages with closures, variables must continue to exist as long as any existing closures have references to them.
This is most commonly implemented using some form of garbage collection.

While this is not always clarified, a closure need not be formed using an anonymous function. The Python programming language, for example, has very limited support for anonymous functions but fully supports closures. For example, one way the above ECMAScript example could be implemented in Python is:

In this example, the function named "gradient" forms a closure together with the variables "f" and "dx". This closure is then returned by the outer function named "derivative". In fact, closures in Python must often be formed using named functions, where an anonymous function might be equally appropriate in other languages, because of the restrictions on lambda forms.

Closures have many uses:

In Scheme


Note: Some speakers call any data structure that binds a lexical environment a closure, but the term usually refers specifically to functions.

It grew around an Iron Age fishing village, now the "Auld Toon" ("old town"), and expanded inland from the Seaside. As late as the 16th century, old maps indicate the town was called Stonehyve or Stonehive.

Stonehaven was the birthplace of Robert William Thomson, inventor of the pneumatic tyre and the fountain pen, of journalist James Murdoch and Lord Reith of Stonehaven, first Director-General of the BBC. 

Stonehaven was a holiday retreat of the poet, Robert Burns.

The Knights Templar appear to have had a base in the area, and a nearby site is still known as "Temple Brae".

Early in 1639, the Marquis of Huntly assembled his forces here, and thereafter went to Kintore in lower Aberdeenshire, eventually marching from there to Aberdeen itself. The Marquis — being informed shortly after his arrival in Aberdeen that a meeting of Covenanters was to be held in Turriff on the fourteenth of February — resolved to disperse them, by occupying the town with 2000 men.

Commedia dell'arte

Commedia dell'Arte is a form of improvisational theatre that began in Italy in the 16th century. It continued to be popular during the 17th century and is still popular today. "Commedia dell'Arte" is Italian for "Comedy of Art". Outside Italy it was known as "Italian Comedy". 

The plays of Commedia dell'Arte were often performed by a small group of actors who travelled around and performed in town squares. The actors would pass a hat round for people to put money in. The words of the plays were mostly never written down. 

The earliest known company was in Padua in 1545. By the turn of the seventeenth century there were several troupes (group of actors) such as the Gelosi, Confidenti, and Fedeli. Some troupes were popular at foreign courts, especially in France, where images from the commedia became a favorite theme of well-known artists.

The actors often wore masks. The stories were often about people being cunning. Hunger, love and money were important in the stories. There were several characters who often appeared in lots of the stories. These are called "stock characters". Examples of stock characters from Commedia dell'Arte are: Harlequin, Pantalone, Arlecchino, Colombina, Pulcinella, Pierrot, Scaramuccia.

Commedia dell'Arte had a lot of influence on theatre plays in many countries. Punch and Judy shows, popular with children in Britain and other countries, are similar to Commedia dell'arte. They also have stock characters: Punch, Judy, the crocodile, the policeman etc.

BonziBUDDY was a freeware program from BONZI Software. The software was available from 1999 to 2005. It is based on the Microsoft Agent technology. The program is no longer available because it contained a lot of adware, malware, and spyware. Most antivirus software picked up the software as Adware. The user would right click on the character's tummy and a menu would come up with different things that the character could do. It could tell jokes, facts, sing songs, download files and keep people on schedule with a calander. Most things required the purchase of add-ons which would add extra jokes, facts and songs. There were also game add-ons and a speech recognition add-on which was called the 'Talking Add-on Module'. The program itself was advertised as an Internet Companion. The offical website stayed open until 2008 and then it was no longer working. BonziBUDDY can still be downloaded by uploads from fans.

For the first version, they used a green bird called Peedy that was created by Microsoft. In 2001, the company made their own fictional character. They called it Bonzi. The fictional character was a purple gorilla. When the program launched, the gorilla would surf onto their screen on a yellow surf board. In later versions, they changed Bonzi's entrance from a surf board to a jungle vine. 

BonziBUDDY had a lot of spyware. It would bring out random advertisements, set the homepage to www.bonzi.com and slow down the computer. It was also rated 6th at PC world's annoying spyware products. It would also collect personal information about what people do on their computer and that was a legal issue about this software.

The Transition

"The Transition" is a song by American rock band Hawthorne Heights from their album "The Silence in Black and White". It is track number four on the album. There is also a live acoustic version of the song on the album.
A video of the song is on the MTV website. MTV Live later played the song on TV.

Graci Carli, the sister of one of the guitar players, sings in the background for this song.

The song was the first song by Hawthorne Heights after changing their name from A Day in the Life. It is called "The Transition" because the band was going through a change when writing it. Because the song says the words "diamond eyes" a lot, some people think that "diamond eyes" is the name of the song.

The song is about love.

Cyclotron

A cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator invented by Ernest Lawrence from the University of California, Berkeley in 1930.
Cyclotrons use perpendicular magnetic field to bend electrons and particles through into a semicircular path by an applied electric field. The applied electric field accelerates electrons between the "D" electrodes(also called "dees") of the magnetic field region.
The accelerating electric field reverses just at the time the electrons finish their half circle, so that it accelerates them across the gap. With a higher speed, they move in a larger semicircle. After repeating this process several times, they come out the exit port at a high speed.

A moving charge in a cyclotron will move in a circular path under the influence of a constant magnetic field. If the time to complete one orbit is calculated:

T=2∏r/v=2∏mv/qBv=2∏m/qB

It is found that the period is independent of the radius. Therefore if a square wave is applied at angular frequency qB/m, the charge will spiral outward, increasing in speed.
When a square wave of angular frequency ω=qB/m is applied between the two sides of the magnetic poles, the charge will be boosted again at just the right time to accelerate it across the gap. Thus the constant cyclotron frequency can continue to accelerate the charge (so long as it is not relativistic).

Johanna Spyri

Johanna Spyri (12 June 1827 – 7 July 1901) wrote stories for children in the German language. Her most famous book was "Heidi". 

She was born Johanna Louise Heusser in Hirzel, Switzerland. Her father was a doctor and her mother was a poet. 

She lived with her extended family: her grandmother, two aunties, and two cousins as well as her mother, father, two brothers and three sisters. This large household inspired her when she wrote "Gritli's Children". 

She spent several summers around Chur in Graubünden when she was young. This setting was later used in her novels.

Her only education was her village school in Hirzel. She wrote poetry as a child.

She married Bernhard Spyri, a town clerk, when she was 25. They met when they were children. They lived in Zurich, Switzerland and had only one child, a son, Berhard Diethelm Spyri, in 1855. In Zurich, they were friends with the musician Richard Wagner and poet Conrad Ferdinand Meyer. Both her husband and son died of tuberculosis in 1884.

In 1870, she started writing to help orphans and refugees of the Franco-Prussian War by describing their situation and giving money from her books to help them.

Her first stories were very popular, so she wrote another story about another orphan, Heidi. She published the first part of "Heidi" anonymously in 1881. It became popular, so she wrote the second part in 1882 using her own name. She became very famous, but preferred a quiet, private life.

She wrote more than forty stories for children in German. Most of these stories have been translated into English. "Heidi" is still her most popular book, with new editions still published today.

She died in Berlin on July 7, 1901, but is buried with her family Zurich.

June Tabor

June Tabor was born on December 31 1947 in Warwick, England. She is an English folk singer.

June Tabor wanted to sing after she heard an Anne Briggs record called "Hazards of Love" in 1965. "I went and locked myself in the bathroom for a fortnight and drove my mother mad. I learned the songs on that EP (extended play record) note for note, twiddle for twiddle. That's how I started singing. If I hadn't heard her I'd have probably done something entirely different." 

She went to St Hugh's College, Oxford University. In 1968 she was on the TV show "University Challenge", as captain of the college team. She joined the Heritage Society at Oxford University. She sang with a group called "Mistral". One of her first recordings was in 1972 on a collection called "Stagfolk Live". She became famous in 1976 when she made the album "Silly Sisters" with Maddy Prior. She also made her first solo album, "Airs and Graces" in 1976. She recorded again with Prior, this time using the name Silly Sisters for their act together. In 1977 guitar player Martin Simpson worked with her in the recording studio for three albums. He moved to America in 1987. (Simpson has come back from America to be a guest player on her albums in the 2000s.) After he left, she worked with piano player Huw Warren.

Tabor stopped singing after many years as a performer. She worked as a librarian
. With her husband David Taylor she ran a restaurant called "Passepartout" in Penrith, Cumbria, England. She returned to performing in the 1990s.

In 1990, June Tabor made an album with the folk-rock band The Oyster Band called "Freedom and Rain". She went on tour with the Oyster Band. A live recording from the tour was made into an album by the Rykodisc label in 1991. In 1992 singer Elvis Costello wrote "All this Useless Beauty" just for Tabor. She recorded the song on "Angel Tiger". Costello didn't record it himself until 1996, on his album "All This Useless Beauty". 

In 1983 June Tabor sang the title song for the BBC TV series "Spyship" . In 1997 she was on Ken Russell's TV show, "In Search of English Folk Song" shown on Channel 4. Tim Winton, author of the 2001 novel "Dirt Music", made a selection of music to go with his novel. The CD "Dirt Music" (2001) includes "He Fades Away" by June Tabor, a sad song about the death of a miner. The song was on her 1994 CD "Against the Streams." In 2002, at the "Passchendale Peace Concert" in Flanders, Tabor shared the stage with Coope Boyes and Simpson. On 30th June 2006 BBC Radio 3 broadcast "Night Waves" to remember the anniversary of the Battle of the Somme. It was broadcast live, with World War I songs sung by June Tabor.

Over the years she has worked in various styles including jazz and art song. She usually has a very plain and simple sound with a sad feeling to it. Her 2003 album "An Echo of Hooves" went back to the traditional ballad style. Many people said it was a great album. "Allmusic" said it was "A stunning jewel in a remarkable career, and one of the best things Tabor’s ever released." "Always" (2005) is a boxed set of four CDs, with songs from her whole career. It has many rare recordings.

On 24th October 2003 Tabor appeared on "Later With Jools Holland" (BBC TV) , singing "Hughie Graeme". This was later put on a DVD of the series. "Folk Britannia" was the name of a concert at the Barbican centre, and a TV mini-series (February 2006, repeated in October). She sang "Fair Margaret and Sweet William" at the Barbican, under the heading "Daughters of Albion". Tabor sang one song on Ashley Hutchings' album "Street Cries" (2001). She also sang on a collection of folk musicians singing songs by the Beatles - "Rubber Folk" (2006). She sang Lennon's "In My Life" a cappella (with out any instruments). 

The way June treats songs is different. For example she often sings traditional songs with just a piano. On the album "Singing The Storm" (2000) she sings with Savourna Stevenson's harp, and Danny Thompson's bass. In May 2004 she performed as part of "The Big Session" and sang Love Will Tear Us Apart as a duet with John Jones of The Oyster Band. In 1992, The Wire voted her song "Queen Among the Heather" one of the "Top 50 Rhythms of all Time".

She also has a sense of humour and fun. This can be seen in her work with Les Barker's The Mrs Ackroyd Band which performs his funny songs. Tabor has sung on three of their albums. In 1990 on the album "Oranges and Lemmings" she sang "The Trains of Waterloo", a funny version of the folk song "The Plains of Waterloo" in a duet with Martin Carthy. In 1994 on "Gnus and Roses" she sang "The January June", which made fun of her sad and serious singing style. In 2003 on the album "Yelp!" she sang "There's a hole in my bodhran", to the tune of "There's a Hole in my Bucket". She sang two songs on "Beat The Retreat", a tribute to Richard Thompson.

Clifton Beach, Karachi

Clifton Beach, on the Arabian Sea, is a beach in Clifton, Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan, one of the neighborhoods of Saddar Town, Karachi. The beach has attractions for families and tourists, including beachside horse and camel rides, amusement parks, restaurants, and swimming in the Arabian Sea.

The whole beach area of Clifton and Seaview is considered safe and peacful even in times of political turmoil.

A gated residential area called Seaview Apartments is close to a section of Clifton beach known as Seaview beach or simply Seaview. Farther ahead is Darakhshan Villas which has residential townhouses.

In this very area new CINEPLEX cinema houses were constructed for the entertainment starved people of Karachi, particularly for the people who reside in DHA and Clifton. This has happened after around three decades of cinema decline in Pakistan. Hollywood films are released here along with or soon after the international releases of these films. These cinemas are more expensive and are family cinemas meaning that no males or group of males are allowed to watch movies here without being accompanied by families, females or children.

Defence Housing Authority is filling the beach area with sand to obtain more ground and this will push the beach farther, which will change the shape and features of this beach.

Other beaches close to the city include "Sandspit", "Hawke's Bay", and "Paradise Point" - a sandstone rock promontory with a natural arch, but Clifton Beach is the most popular picnic destination in Karachi.

"This article is about the town in Alabama. For other uses, see Alabaster (disambiguation)"

Alabaster is a city and southern suburb of Birmingham in Shelby County, Alabama, United States. At the 2000 census the population was 22,619. According to the 2005 U.S. Census estimates, the city had a population of 27,517.

Alabaster is located at (33.231162, -86.823829).

The city has a total area of 20.6 square miles (53.2 km²). 20.5 square miles (53.0 km²) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.1 km²) of it (0.24%) is water.

Shelby County, which is the geographical center of Alabama, was created on 7 February 1818 by an act of the Alabama Territorial General Assembly. The county was named for Isaac Shelby. He was a hero of the King's Mountain Battle during the American Revolutionary War. Alabama gained statehood on 14 December 1819.

Many of the first settlers came from South Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky. Many came to this region after the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814. The 1820 census records say that Shelby County contained 2,492 people at that time, 2,044 whites and 448 Africans.

U.S. Highway 31 was a two-lane highway at that time. Because it was the main artery from Birmingham to Montgomery, the highway played an important part in the growth of the community.

George L. Scott, Sr. was an Alabaster pioneer. He owned and operated Alabaster Lime Co. His shipping point, which was named after him, was known as “Scott Rock”. Later, houses were built for his employees to live in. These houses became a community. It got its name from alabaster, a white chalky mineral. The First Bank of Alabaster opened in 1952. Its president was George L. Scott, Jr. He later became the first mayor of Alabaster. The first attempt in 1952 to incorporate Alabaster failed. In January 1953 the petition was filed again. On 23 February 1953, Alabaster was officially incorporated. There were 427 people living there. Other Alabaster pioneers were Kenton B. Nickerson and William J. Maxwell. In 1955, the Alabaster Water and Gas Board was formed. Alabaster merged with the adjoining city of Siluria, Alabama April 27, 1971. 

Today, Shelby County is the fastest-growing county in Alabama.

Why I Am Not a Christian

Why I Am Not a Christian is an essay by the British philosopher Bertrand Russell. It describes the reasons why Russell does not believe in God and doubts religion.

At first, a talk given March 6, 1927 at Battersea Town Hall, at the South London Branch of the National Secular Society. It was published that year as a pamphlet and was later published, with other essays, in the book, "Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects" (ISBN 0-671-20323-1).

Moapa Valley

Moapa Valley is a 40-mile valley and region in the American State of Nevada. Within the valley are four towns: Overton, Logandale, Moapa, and Glendale, Nevada. Logandale and Overton are so close to each other that it is hard to tell them apart without a sign. Moapa Valley was formed by the Muddy River, which flows through it.

Moapa Valley has many archaeological sites, mostly created by the Anasazi Native Americans, which were largely damaged by construction. 

Moapa Valley is also the location of the Lost City Museum, which is a museum displaying artifacts and reconstructed adobe pueblos built on the original sites of the pueblos.

Passenger Pigeon

The Passenger Pigeon ("Ectopistes migratorius") or wild pigeon was a species of pigeon that was once the most common bird in North America.

The passenger pigeon, or, wild pigeon was a species of bird, Ectopistes migratorius, that was once common in North America. It lived in enormous migratory flocks — sometimes containing more than two billion birds — that could stretch one mile (1.6 km) wide and 300 miles (500 km) long across the sky, sometimes taking several hours to pass.

Some estimate that there were three billion to five billion passenger pigeons in the United States when Europeans arrived in North America. Others argue that the species had not been common in the Pre-Columbian period, but their numbers grew when devastation of the American Indian population by European diseases led to reduced competition for food.

The species went from being one of the most usual birds in the world during the 19th century to extinction early in the 20th century. At the time, passenger pigeons had one of the largest groups or flocks of any animal, second only to the Rocky Mountain locust.

Some reduction in numbers happened because of habitat loss when the Europeans started settling further inland. The primary factor emerged when pigeon meat was commercialized as a cheap food for slaves and the poor in the 19th century, resulting in hunting on a massive scale. There was a slow decline in their numbers between about 1800 and 1870, followed by a catastrophic decline between 1870 and 1890. Martha, thought to be the world's last passenger pigeon, died on September 1, 1914, in Cincinnati, Ohio.

In the 18th century, the passenger pigeon in Europe was known to the French as tourtre; but, in New France, the North American bird was called tourte. In modern French, the bird is known as the pigeon migrateur.

In Algonquian languages, it was called "amimi" by the Lenape and omiimii by the Ojibwe. The term passenger pigeon in English derives from the French word "passager", meaning to pass by.

Sergei Eisenstein

Sergei Mikhailovich Eisenstein (; January 23, 1898 – February 11, 1948) was a Soviet Russian film director and film theorist. He was known mostly for his silent films "Strike", "Battleship Potemkin" and "". He was also known for his historical epics "Alexander Nevsky" and "Ivan the Terrible". His work had a major impact on early film directors because of his creative use of and writings about montage.

Eisenstein was born in Riga, Latvia but his family moved a lot in his early years. Eisenstein continued to move often during his life. Eisenstein's father Mikhail Osipovich Eisenstein was of German-Jewish and Swedish descent and his mother, Julia Ivanovna Konetskaya, was from a Russian Orthodox family. He was born into a middle-class family. His father was an architect and his mother was the daughter of a wealthy merchant. Julia left Riga the year of the 1905 Revolution. She brought Sergei with her to St. Petersburg. Sergei would return at times to see his father. His father would later move to join them around 1910. His mother soon divorced his father and moved to France away from the family.

At the Petrograd Institute of Civil Engineering, Sergei studied architecture and engineering, the job of his father. At school with his fellow students however, Sergei would join the military to serve the revolution. His father did not support his joining the army. In 1918 Sergei joined the Red Army with his father, Mikhail, supporting the opposite side. This brought his father to Germany after defeat, and Sergei to Petrograd, Vologda, and Dvinsk. In 1920, Sergei was transferred to a command position in Minsk, after success providing propaganda for the October Revolution. At this time, Sergei studied Japanese. He learned some three hundred kanji characters which he cited as an influence on his pictorial development. This also allowed him to see Kabuki theatre. Because of his studies, he traveled to Japan.<br clear="all">

In 1920 Eisenstein moved to Moscow, and began his career in theatre working for Proletkult. His productions there were named "Gas Masks," "Listen Moscow," and "Wiseman". Eisenstein would then work as a designer for Vsevolod Meyerhold. In 1923 Eisenstein began his career as a theorist, by writing "The Montage of Attractions" for LEF. Eisenstein's first film, "Glumov's Diary", was also made in that same year. Dziga Vertov hired at first as an "instructor" for the film The film formed part of his theatre production "Wiseman".

"Strike" (1925) was Eisenstein's first full-length feature film. "The Battleship Potemkin" (1925) was well liked by critics throughout the world. Because he was known throughout the world, Eisenstein was able to direct "" (also known as "Ten Days That Shook The World"). The film was part of the tenth anniversary celebration of the October Revolution of 1917. He then directed "The General Line" (also known as "Old and New"). People in the outside world praised the films. However, in the Soviet Union, Eisenstein's focus on structural issues such as camera angles, crowd movements and montage, was not liked by the much of the Soviet film community.

In the autumn of 1928, Eisenstein left the Soviet Union for a tour of Europe. He was joined by Grigori Aleksandrov and cinematographer Eduard Tisse. The trip was supposed to allow Eisenstein and others to learn about sound motion pictures. It would also show the famous Soviet artists to the capitalist West. For Eisenstein, however, it was also an opportunity to see landscapes and cultures outside those found within the Soviet Union. He spent the next two years touring and lecturing in Berlin, Zurich, London, and Paris. In 1929, in Switzerland, Eisenstein supervised an educational documentary about abortion directed by Edouard Tissé entitled "Frauennot - Frauenglück".

In late April 1930, Jesse L. Lasky, working for Paramount Pictures, offered Eisenstein the chance to make a film in the United States. He accepted a short-term contract for $100,000 and arrived in Hollywood in May 1930. However, this agreement failed. Eisenstein's approach to filmmaking did not work with the style and way films were made in American film studios.

Eisenstein proposed a biography of munitions invester Sir Basil Zaharoff and a film version of "Arms and the Man" by George Bernard Shaw. He also made plans for a film of "Sutter's Gold" by Jack London. But the studio's producers did not like the plan. Paramount then proposed a movie version of Theodore Dreiser's "An American Tragedy". This excited Eisenstein, who had read and liked the work, and had met Dreiser at one time in Moscow. Eisenstein completed a script by the start of October 1930. Paramount disliked it completely. They also found themselves intimidated by Major Frank Pease, president of the "Hollywood Technical Director's Institute". Pease, an anti-communist, started a public campaign against Eisenstein. On October 23, 1930, Paramount and Eisenstein declared their contract canceled. Eisenstein and his film partners were given return tickets to Moscow, at Paramount's expense.

Eisenstein was faced with returning home as a failure. The Soviet film industry was solving the sound-film issue without him and his films. His methods and ideas were becoming increasingly attacked as 'ideological failures'. They were called examples of formalism. Many of his theoretical articles from this period, such as "Eisenstein on Disney", have been found decades later as important scholarly texts. These are used in film schools around the world.

Eisenstein spent a large amount of time with Charlie Chaplin. Chaplin recommended that Eisenstein meet American socialist author Upton Sinclair who Chaplin thought might help Eisenstein. Sinclair's works had been accepted by and were widely read in the Soviet Union, and were known to Eisenstein. The two liked each other's work. Between the end of October 1930, and Thanksgiving of that year, Sinclair had gotten an extension of Eisenstein's leave from the Soviet Union. He also received permission for Eisenstein to travel to Mexico to make a film to be produced by Sinclair and his wife, Mary Craig Kimbrough Sinclair. They joined with three other investors to make the Mexican Film Trust.

On November 24, Eisenstein signed a contract with the Trust. The deal was "upon the basis of Eisenstein's desire to be free to direct the making of a picture according to his own ideas of what a Mexican picture should be, and in full faith in Eisenstein's artistic integrity." The contract also said that the film would be "non-political." The money first came from Mrs. Sinclair and would be "not less than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars." The schedule for making the movie would be "a period of from three to four months,". The contract also said that "Eisenstein...agrees that all pictures made or directed by him in Mexico, all negative film and positive prints, and all story and ideas embodied in said Mexican picture, will be the property of Mrs. Sinclair..." An addition to the contract, dated December 1, allowed that the "Soviet Government may have the [finished] film free for showing inside the U.S.S.R." Reportedly, it was verbally decided that the film was expected to be an hour long. 

By December 4, 1930, Eisenstein was on his way to Mexico by train. He was joined by Alexandrov and Tisse. Later he came up with a short summary of the six-part film which would come. This would be the final plan Eisenstein would settle on for his project. The title for the project, "¡Que viva México!", was decided on some time later. While in Mexico, Eisenstein mixed socially with Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. Eisenstein liked these artists and Mexican culture in general. They inspired Eisenstein to call his films, "moving frescoes."

After a long time away from the Soviet Union, Stalin sent a telegram saying he was worried that Eisenstein had become a deserter. Eisenstein blamed Mary Sinclair's younger brother, Hunter Kimbrough, for the film's problems. Kimbrough had been sent along to act as a line producer on the film. Eisenstein hoped to pressure the Sinclairs to stop Stalin, so Eisenstein could finish the film in his own way.

The upset Sinclair shut down production. He ordered Kimbrough to return to the United States with the remaining film footage. The three Soviets came as well to see what they could do with the film already shot. For the unfinished filming of the "novel" of Soldadera, Eisenstein had gotten 500 soldiers, 10,000 guns, and 50 cannons from the Mexican Army. This was lost due to Sinclair's canceling of production.

When Eisenstein arrived at the American border, a customs search of his trunk revealed sketches and drawings of Jesus along with other material of a pornographic nature. Eisenstein's re-entry visa had expired, and Sinclair's contacts in Washington were unable to secure him an additional extension. Eisenstein, Alexandrov and Tisse were, after a month's stay at the U.S.-Mexico border outside Laredo, Texas, allowed a 30-day "pass" to get from Texas to New York. From there, they would be allowed to leave for Moscow. Kimbrough returned to Los Angeles with the remaining film.

Eisenstein toured the American South, on his way to New York. In mid-1932, the Sinclairs were able to get the services of Sol Lesser. Lesser had just opened his own distribution office in New York, Principal Distributing Corp.. Lesser agreed to supervise post-production work on the miles of negative — at the Sinclairs' expense — and distribute any finished product. Two short feature films and a short subject — "Thunder Over Mexico" based on the "Maguey" footage, "Eisenstein in Mexico", and "Death Day" respectively — were completed and released in the United States between the autumn of 1933 and early 1934.

Eisenstein never saw any of the Sinclair-Lesser films, nor a later effort by his first biographer, Marie Seton, called "Time In The Sun." He would publicly say that he had lost all interest in the project.

Eisenstein's trip to the west made the Soviet film business look at him with a suspicion that would never completely go away. He apparently spent some time in a mental hospital in Kislovodsk in July 1933. This was possibly a result of depression because he realized that he would never be allowed to edit the Mexican footage which was turned over by Sinclair to Hollywood editors.

He was then given a teaching job with the film school GIK (now Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography) where he had taught before. In 1933 and 1934 he was in charge of writing the education plan. Eisenstein married filmmaker and writer Pera Atasheva (1900–65) in 1934. They remained married until his death in 1948. There is some question about his sexuality.

In 1935, he began another project, "Bezhin Meadow". It appears the film had many of the same problems as "Que Viva Mexico". Eisenstein decided to film two versions of the plot. One was for adult viewers and one was for children. He failed to set a clear shooting schedule. He also used a lot of film which meant a lot of costs and missed deadlines. The film ran into problems because it was not fully supported by its American financers.

The thing that may have saved Eisenstein's career at this point was that Stalin ended up saying that the "Bezhin Meadow" problems, along with several other problems facing the business, had less to do with Eisenstein's approach to filmmaking as with the executives who were supposed to have been watching him. In the end, this made Boris Shumyatsky, "executive producer" of Soviet film since 1932 to blame. In early 1938, he was denounced, arrested, tried and convicted as a traitor, and shot. (The production executive at Film studio Mosfilm, where Meadow was being made, was also replaced, but without more executions).

Eisenstein was then able to impress Stalin again for "one more chance", and he chose, from two offerings, the job of a film of "Alexander Nevsky," with music composed by Sergei Prokofiev. This time, however, he was also given a co-writer, Pyotr Pavlenko, to bring in a completed script. He had professional actors to play the roles. He also had an assistant director, Dmitri Vasilyev, to make the filming faster.

The result was a film critically received by both the Soviets and in the West. He won the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Prize. It was an obvious allegory and hard warning against the growing forces of Nazi Germany. This was started, completed, and put in theatres all within 1938. It was Eisenstein's first film in nearly a decade. It also his first film with sound.

But, within months of its release, Stalin entered into his agreement with Hitler. "Nevsky" was quickly pulled from distribution. Eisenstein returned to teaching. He was assigned to direct Richard Wagner's "Die Walküre" at the Bolshoi Theatre. Eisenstein had to wait until Hitler's sent German troops across the Soviet border in a fatal first strike, to see "Nevsky" receive wide distribution and real international success.

With the war coming to Moscow, Eisenstein was one of many filmmakers evacuated to Alma-Ata. There is where he first considered the idea of making a film about Czar Ivan IV. Eisenstein wrote letters to Prokofiev from Alma-Ata. Prokofiev joined him there in 1942. Prokofiev composed the score for Eisenstein's film. Eisenstein designed sets for an opera version of "War and Peace" that Prokofiev was creating.

Eisenstein's film, "Ivan The Terrible, Part I", showing Ivan IV of Russia as a national hero, was liked by Joseph Stalin (and it won a Stalin Prize). The sequel, "Ivan The Terrible, Part II", was not approved of by the government. All the film from the not-finished "" was taken away, and most of it was destroyed (though several filmed scenes still exist today).

Eisenstein's health was also failing. He had a heart attack during the making of this film. He died soon after of another heart attack at the age of 50. He is buried at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

Eisenstein was one of the first to use montage, a specific form of film editing. He and Lev Kuleshov, two of the first film theorists, said that montage was the basis of film. His articles and books — especially "Film Form" and "The Film Sense" — explain the need for montage in detail.

His writings and films have continued to have a major impact on later filmmakers. Eisenstein believed that editing could be used for more than just explaining a scene or moment through a "linkage" of related images. Eisenstein felt the "collision" of shots could be used to control the feelings of the audience and create film metaphors. He believed that an idea should be concluded from comparing two different shots. This is what made a collage or montage within film. He developed what he called "methods of montage":


Eisenstein taught film making during his career at GIK. He also wrote the lessons for the directors' course there. His classroom illustrations are reproduced in Vladimir Nizhniĭ's "Lessons with Eisenstein." Exercises and examples for students were based on literature such as Honoré de Balzac's "Le Père Goriot." Another situation students had to produce was the staging of the Haitian struggle for independence as depicted in Anatolii Vinogradov's "The Black Consul,". Eisenstein also taught the specifics of directing, photography, and editing. He encouraged his students' development of individuality, expressiveness, and creativity. Eisenstein's teaching, like his films, were politically charged and contained quotes from Vladimir Lenin.

In his first films, Eisenstein did not use professional actors. His narratives did not focus on individual characters. Instead, they addressed broad social issues, especially class conflict. He used basic characters, and the roles were filled with untrained people from the matching classes. He avoided using stars. Eisenstein's vision of communism brought him into conflict with officials in the ruling system of Joseph Stalin. Like many Bolshevik artists, Eisenstein pictured a new society which would pay for artists totally. This would free them from bosses and budgets. It would leave them free to create. But budgets and producers were as important to the Soviet film business as the rest of the world. The isolated, post-revolution, new nation did not have the resources to nationalize its film business at first. When it did, limited resources — both monetary and equipment — required production controls as big as in the capitalist world.

Yass, New South Wales

Yass is a town in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. It is in the Yass Valley Shire. The name probably comes from an Aboriginal word, "Yarrh" (or "Yharr"), which means 'running water'.

Yass is located about 280 km south west of Sydney and is 56km north of Canberra. It is on the Hume Highway which is the main road between Melbourne and Sydney. The new Hume Freeway goes around the town. The Yass River flows past the town. It later flows into the Murrumbidgee River.

Yass has an impressive and historic main street. It includes many 19th century hotels with large verandahs. It is popular with tourists, some from Canberra and others taking a break from the Hume Highway.

The Pride of Erin Festival and Yass Show are held in March. The Yass Arts-and-Crafts Festival is held in November.

In 1821 the Yass area was discovered by the European explorer Hamilton Hume. In 1830 a small village began. It started where the road crossed the Yass River. The road became the main road to Melbourne.

Yass became a District Council in 1842. By 1848 there were 248 people living in Yass. On 13 March, 1873, the Municipal District of Yass was begun. James Cottrell was elected as the first Mayor of Yass.

One of Australia's best known poets, A.B. 'Banjo' Paterson came to the area with his family in 1871. He was only 7 and spent his childhood in the district, near Binalong. He later bought a property at Wee Jasper, near Yass, so that his children could enjoy a country life. Poet and priest Patrick Hartigan was born near Yass in 1878. He studied at the local convent school as a youth. He wrote using the name John O'Brien.

Sir Walter Merriman started a farm called 'Merryville'. It became one of Australia's most famous sheep farms. It produced some of the best fine wool in 1903. Yass is an important area for raising sheep which have very fine wool. This is because of the soil and climate in the Yass area.

Yass was one of the sites suggested for the Australian Federal Capital after 1901.

Because of the steep hills the New South Wales Government Railways built the railway a few kilometres from the town. The people in Yass wanted the railway to pass closer or even through the town. In 1892, a light railway or tram was built to connect Yass Junction on the main railway line and Yass Town. 

Yass Junction was the nearest railway station on the Sydney Melbourne railway to serve the national capital at Canberra. The uniform gauge (distance between the rails) railway line between Melbourne and Sydney was opened in 1961. The special train had to stop at Yass Junction to pick up William Charles Wentworth. He was a member of parliament who had worked hard to get the railway built. He could not get on the train at Sydney because he was needed in the parliament at Canberra. 

St Augustine's Parish Yass began in 1838 with the laying of the foundation stone of the church now called the Chapel.

An unusual modern style new building (the 'big' church) was begun in 1954. The bishop in charge was Bishop Young who later became the Archbishop of Hobart. The design for the church was by the architects Fowell Mansfield and Maclurcan of Sydney. The builder was James Wallace of 123 Sussex St Sydney.

There are important works of art by famous Australian sculptor Tom Bass in the Church:


The foundation stone of the new church was laid on 11 April 1954 by Archbishop Eris O'Brien and the church was opened on 29 April 1956, by Archbishop Guilford Young. Fifty year celebrations were organised on 29 April 2006 by Father Laurie Bent.

Community of Christ

The Community of Christ is a Mormon movement. From 1872 to 2001, it was known as Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS). It was founded in the 1860s. It did not recognise Brigham Young as a Prophet, but instead followed Joseph Smith III, the son of the founder of Mormonism, Joseph Smith. Unlike the followers of Young who went to Utah they remained were they were, in the Midwestern United States, mainly in Missouri. A number of court cases established this Church as the follower of law of the church established by Smith. for this reason it has the most manuscripts and the oldest Temple. 

In general, their beliefs are closer to mainline Protestant Christianity. Unlike other Latter-day Saints movemements, they have a classic view of the Trinity. They see the Book of Mormon as a valid source of learning, but not as an additional revelation or scripture. Their baptism is therefore recognised as a valid Christian one.

November 2008 Mumbai attacks

The November 2008 Mumbai attacks were twelve attacks of terror happening at the same time across Mumbai, India, from 26 November 2008. 172 people were killed and 293 were injured. 

A group called Deccan Mujahideen which was not known before, has said it was responsible for the attacks. It is possible that they are a part of the Indian Mujahideen.

Around fifty to sixty terrorists took part in the attacks. They looked young, in their early twenties, and wore T-shirts, black shirts, and jeans. "The Guardian" has said that they seemed "cool and composed" and "in no hurry".

Police officers who rescued hostages at the Chabad House were surprised that the terrorists looked "white" and either non-Indian or from the country's far north. The terrorists had planned the attack several months before. They set up "control rooms" in the two luxury hotels that were targeted.

A previously unknown group, the Deccan Mujahideen, claimed responsibility. They sent emails to news organizations. "The New York Times" has stated that international security experts "drew a blank on" the Deccan Mujahideen group, with one analyst labeling it a "front name". In September, the Indian Mujahideen had warned of future attacks. Their message said that "you are already on our hit-list and this time very, very seriously."

According to a witness, the gunmen were looking for American and British passport holders and left others alone, such as a man claiming to be Italian. At the same time, "The Independent" has reported that "the attackers were young South Asian men speaking Hindi or Urdu suggesting they are probably members of an Indian militant group rather than foreigners".

The Deccan Mujahiddeen is believed to be a terrorist group. They do attacks inside India. They came to the attention of the public after they said they were responsible for the attacks on Mumbai on 26 November 2008. It is possible that the organization could be related to the Indian Mujahideen.

Deccan refers to the Deccan Plateau in southern India. The states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu lie on this plateau. The name is an anglicised from the Prakrit word "dakkhin". That word comes from the Sanskrit word "dakṣiṇa-" (), meaning 'South' or 'The South'.

Mujahideen (also spelt Mujahedin) in Arabic is a "struggler". So the name Deccan Muhahideen may literally mean "Strugglers of the South", "The South Strugglers" or "South Strugglers".

Case (grammar)

In grammar, case shows the role of a noun, adjective or pronoun in a sentence. It is a set of forms which depend on the syntax (how the words go together). Case is an example of inflection, which is an affix (a part of a word that is added to other words) that signals a grammatical relationship. Once it was part of Old English, but modern English does not use it much.

In the Romance languages (Spanish, French, etc.), which are all derived from Latin, nouns pack several ideas into one word. These ideas are:

So, in many languages like Latin (especially), German, Russian, Spanish and Japanese, a noun's case is shown by the end of the word (the nouns change depending on their role in the sentence). Nouns change their endings to show if they are doing an action, if they are having an action done to them, if they just happen to be there during the action and whether they own something. Therefore the word order is less important in these languages, whereas in English it is vital. 

In English we have only the remnants of this complicated system. We use word order and add auxiliary (helping) words as needed. 

English does have these cases for nouns and pronouns: "common case" and "genitive" (possessive). Each may take a plural. Examples:
In English adjectives are unchanged: "red hat", "red hats".

Axon

The Axon is the part of a neuron that sends the signal. Axons are long, thin and tendril-like.

Axons are much like a highly developed dendrite.

The axon carries an electrical signal from the cell body to the synapse. There the signal passes to other neurons or to muscle fibers. The axon may be over a meter long in humans, and even longer in bigger animals, like elephants and whales. 

The electrical signal of an axon is made by ions that flow in and out of the cell in a chain reaction called an action potential. The speed at which the signal travels depends on how thick the axon is, and how much insulation it has. Insulation is provided by specialized cells called myelin that wrap around the axon.

The Haast's Eagle ("Harpagornis moorei") was the largest eagle ever to have lived and is the only eagle in the world ever to have been top predator of its ecosystem. It lived on the South Island of New Zealand.

Fossil evidence shows that the areas where the Haast’s Eagle lived were covered in forest and shrublands, as well as in the grasslands on river floodplains. 

The arrival of people in New Zealand had unfortunate consequences for the eagle by 1400 AD, most of the forest habitat it used had been cleared by fire, and most of the large flightless birds that it ate had been hunted to extinction.

Benjamin W. Lee

Benjamin Whiso Lee (Korean: 이휘소, Lee Whi-so) (January 1, 1935 - June 16, 1977) or Ben Lee, was a Korean-American theoretical physicist. His work in theorical particle physics was very important to the development of the standard model in the late 20th century. His work mainly affected the renormalization and the charm quark.

Benjamin W. Lee was born in Seoul, Korea. Before finishing high school, he entered the department of Chemical Engineering at Seoul National University. He was one of the best students. During his time in college, he transferred to the United States. He graduated from Miami University. Lee received a master degree from the University of Pittsburgh, and his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania at the age of 25. Lee worked at Institute for Advanced Study. He was a professor of physics at University of Pennsylvania, SUNY at Stony Brook, University of Chicago, and head of the theoretical physics department at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. On June 16, 1977, he was killed in a car accident near Kewanee, Illinois. Lee studied symmetry principles and weak interactions.

Alessandro Volta

Count Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta (18 February 1745 – 5 March 1827) was a Lombard physicist known especially for the development of the first electrical cell in 1800. He was born in Como in Lombardy, Italy.

Volta worked on the electrophorus that makes a static electric charge in 1775. Volta also studied what we now call capacitance, developing separate means to study both electrical potential V and charge Q, and discovering that for a given object they are proportional. This may be called Volta's Law of Capacitance, and likely for this work the unit of electrical potential has been named the volt. Around 1791 he began to study "animal electricity". In this way he discovered Volta's Law of the electrochemical series, and the law that the electromotive force (emf formula_1) of a galvanic cell. In 1800, He invented the "voltaic pile", an early electric battery, which made a steady electric current. It is credited as the first electrochemical cell.
In honor of his work in the field of electricity, Napoleon made him a count in 1810. A museum in Como, the Voltian Temple, has been built in his honor and exhibits some of the original equipment he used to conduct experiments. In 1881, an important electrical unit, the volt(V), was named in his honor. There have also been innovations and discoveries named after Alessandro Volta including the Toyota Alessandro Volta, and the Volta Crater on the Moon.

Volta married the daughter of Count Ludovico Peregrini, Teresa, with whom he raised three sons. In 1779 he became professor of experimental physics at the University of Pavia, a chair he occupied for almost 25 years. Volta is buried in the city of Como. At the Tempio Voltiano near Lake Como there is a museum devoted to explaining his work.

Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz

Friedrich August Kekule von Stradonitz (also August Kekulé) (7 September 1829 – 13 July 1896) was a German organic chemist. Kekulé was born in Darmstadt, the son of a civil servant. After graduating from secondary school, in 1847 he entered the University of Giessen, with the intention of studying architecture. After hearing the lectures of Justus von Liebig he decided to study chemistry. Following his education in Giessen, he took postdoctoral fellowships in Paris (1851-52), in Chur, Switzerland (1852-53), and in London (1853-55), where he was decisively influenced by Alexander Williamson.

In 1858 he was hired as full professor at the University of Ghent, then in 1867 was called to Bonn. He studied carbon compounds, especially studied benzene and he suggested benzene ring structure. 

Kekulé's most famous work was on the structure of benzene. In 1865 Kekulé published a paper in French suggesting that the structure contained a six-membered ring of carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds. The next year he published a much longer paper in German on the same subject. The empirical formula for benzene had been long known, but its highly unsaturated structure was challenging to determine. Archibald Scott Couper in 1858 and Joseph Loschmidt in 1861 suggested possible structures that contained multiple double bonds or multiple rings, but the study of aromatic compounds was in its earliest years, and too little evidence was then available to help chemists decide on any particular structure.

Ultra high frequency

Ultra High Frequency (UHF) is a electromagnetic radiation. Especially its frequency is between 300 MHz and 3 GHz (3,000 MHz). Because of short wavelenth, UHF has strong directivity and it has small area. UHF is commonly used for television signals. It is strong enough to be protected from other signal, but because of its strong directivity, receiving error by an obstacle occurs more. Hence it needs sensitive sensors.
UHF frequencies have higher attenuation from atmospheric moisture and benefit less from 'bounce', or the reflection of signals off the ionosphere back to earth, when compared to VHF frequencies. The frequencies of 300–3000 MHz are always at least an order of magnitude above the MUF (Maximum Usable Frequency). The MUF for most of the earth is generally between 25–35 MHz. Higher frequencies also benefit less from ground mode transmission. However, the short wavelengths of UHF frequencies allow compact receiving antennas with narrow elements; many people consider them less ugly than VHF-receiving models 

On December 29, 1949 KC2XAK of Bridgeport, Connecticut became the first UHF television station to operate on a regular daily schedule. 
In the United States, UHF stations (broadcast channels above 13) originally gained a reputation for being more locally owned, less polished, less professional, less popular, and for having a weaker signal than their VHF counterparts (channels 2–13). The movie UHF, starring Weird Al Yankovic, parodied this phenomenon. 
However, with the emergence of additional broadcast television networks ( Fox, UPN, WB, and PaxThe PAX Network PAX TV PaxNet or simply PAX is a cable television network formed in 1998.

Most HDTV stations (those using the ATSC television standard) broadcast their over-the-air signal in the UHF band. 

In Britain, UHF television began with the launch of BBC2 in 1964, using a 625-line system (which had higher resolution, and therefore required greater bandwidth, than the existing 405-line system). BBC1 and ITV soon added their own 625-line services on UHF (British channels 21 to 69), and PAL colour was introduced on UHF only in 1967– 1969. VHF was phased out by 1986. Today all British terrestrial television channels (analog and digital) are on UHF. A drawback to this is the very large number of small relay transmitters needed to fill in gaps in the main transmitters' coverage, which would not have been necessary with a VHF system due to its different propagation characteristics.

LC circuit is an electronic circuit made up of an inductor and a capacitor.

LC circuit's resonant frequency is equal to: formula_1 

The angular frequency ω has units of radians per second.

LC circuits are used for creating signals at a particular frequency, or picking out a signal at a particular frequency from a more complex signal. An ideal LC circuit does not have resistance.

At LC circuit energy saves in the capacitor's electric field.

formula_2 

U is energy and q is electric charge.
At LC circuit energy also save in the inductor's magnetic field.

formula_3 

U is energy and i is electric current that flows in inductor.

Let's analyze an LC circuit's vibration. Vibrating LC circuit's total energy is U.

formula_4

Because circuit's resistance is 0, there is no energy that transmits to heat energy, and U is maintained regularity.
formula_5 

So LC circuit's vibration is shown like that
formula_6

First consider the Electrical impedance of the series LC circuit. The total impedance is given by the sum of the inductive and capacitive impedances

formula_7

By writing the inductive impedance as formula_8 and capacitive impedance as formula_9 

Resultingly the series connected circuit, when connected to a circuit in series, will act as a band-pass filter having zero impedance at the resonant frequency of the LC circuits.

The same analysis may be applied to the parallel LC circuit. The total impedance is then given by

formula_11

and after substitution of formula_12 and formula_13 we have

formula_14

which simplifies to

formula_15 .

Resultingly the parallel connected circuit will act as band-stop filter having infinite impedance at the resonant frequency of the LC circuit.

Application-specific integrated circuit

ASIC or Application-specific integrated circuit is a kind of integrated circuit. It is built for a particular use instead of for general-purpose use. Digital circuits are a common form of ASIC, but analog circuits were manufactured beginning in the latter half of the 1990s.

ASIC has advantages compared to Programmable Logic Device or Standard Logic IC. First, ASIC has a miniaturized embodiment size. Second, ASIC can improve speed. Third, ASIC needs less electric power to operate. There are also disadvantages of ASIC. First, the cost per a unit can be expensive when producing a small number of units because of the expensive cost in producing a mask.. Second, they can be hard to design and it is expensive and wastes time if they need to be redesigned. Third, the time of a manufacturing process can be long. 

Design of ASIC is gate array design, cell base design, embedded array design, standard cell design, and structured ASIC design.

With prepared foundation which has elementary gate circuit at first base, (we) manufacture the products with putting ordered proper wire-layers.
Its manufacturing due is short because a finished product needs only production of wire-layers and it is cheap because (we) mass-produce its foundation.
However, because (we) form a circuit with formation of standard gate, it has worse contact rate and efficiency.

wire-layer is made between block that was designed and arranged and logical circuit. and product is manufactured .
performance is better than gate array. but time of making cell base is longer than time of making gate array. and cost of making cell base is more expensive than cost of making gate array.

Instead of part of gate array base , finished functional block were located. It was rest of theory for wired to use part of gate array. It was called that gate array and basis of cell were compro-mising.

standard cell is a general term for gate array, cell base, embedded array. if standard cell is cell base IC, direction is different each company.

For reduce time of development. a wide use block, which are similar with input and output interface and SRAM and PPL, was arranged on Basis of gate array in advance. Because It was able to correspond with minimum of individual plan. We could see that Company of Distributed circuit ,which had wired to use exclusive wire-layer, Tried to reduce plan of consumer. It’s very different to Each of company offerd function.
Designers of ASIC use a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL to describe the functionality of ASIC.

<doc id="143324" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143324" title="Photoelectric effect">
Photoelectric effect

The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in physics. The effect is based on the idea that electromagnetic radiation is made of a series of particles called photons. When a photon hits an electron on a metals surface, the electron can be emitted The emitted electrons are called photoelectrons. The effect is also called the Hertz Effect, because it was discovered by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, but this name is not used often.

The photoelectric effect has helped physicists understand the quantum nature of light and electrons. The concept of wave–particle duality was developed because of the photoelectric effect.

Not every electromagnetic wave will cause the photoelectric effect, only radiation of a certain frequency or higher will cause the effect. The minimum frequency needed is called the cutoff frequency or threshold frequency. The cutoff frequency is used to find the work function, w, which is the amount of energy holding the electron to the metal surface. The work function is a property of the metal and is not affected by the incoming radiation. If a frequency of light strikes the metal surface that is greater than the cutoff frequency, then the emitted electron will have some kinetic energy. 

The energy of a photon causing the photoelectric effect is found through E = hf = KE + w, where h is Planck's constant, 6.626X10^34 J*s, f is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave, KE is the kinetic energy of the photoelectron and w is the work function for the metal. If the photon has a lot of energy, compton scattering(~thousands of eV) or pair production(~millions of eV) may take place.

The intensity of the light does not cause ejection of electrons, only light of the cut off frequency or higher can do that. However increasing the intensity of light will increase the number of electrons being emitted, so long as the frequency is above the cut off frequency.

The first observation of the photoelectric effect was by Heinrich Hertz in 1887. He reported that a spark jumped more readily between two charged spheres if light was shining on them. Further studies where done to learn about the effect observed by Hertz, however it wasn't until 1905 that a theory was purposed that explained the effect completely. The theory was proposed by Einstein and it made the claim that electromagnetic radiation had to be thought of as a series of particles, called photons, which collide with the electrons on the surface and emit them. This theory ran contrary to the belief that electromagnetic radiation was a wave and thus it was not recognized as correct until 1916 when Robert Millikan preformed a series of experiments using a vacuum phototube to confirm the theory.

In electrical engineering and computer science, Image processing is any form of processing for which the input is an image, such as photographs or frames of video. The output of image processing can be either an image or a set of characteristics or parameters related to the image.

It also means "Analyzing and manipulating images with a computer".
Image processing is performed this three steps: 
First, import images with an optical devices like a scanner or a camera or directly through digital processing.
Second, manipulate or analyze the images in some way. This step can include image improvement and data summary, or the images are analyzed to find rules that aren't seen by the human eyes. For example, meteorologists use this processing to analyze satellite photographs.
Last, output the result of image processing. The result might be the image changed by some way or it might be a report based on analysis or result of the images.
Image processing usually means "digital" image processing, but optical and analog image processing are also included in image processing.

White supremacy

White supremacy is the belief that white people are better than other races. The words "white supremacy" are sometimes used to describe a political idea that shows the social and political dominance of whites.

It is associated with racism. White supremacists also want racial separation, which means people of different races living apart. White supremacy has often resulted in anti-black racism and antisemitism (Anti-Jewish).

Different kinds of white supremacy have different ideas of whiteness, and not all white supremacist groups agree on which group is their greatest enemy. White supremacists frequently consider Jews to be the biggest threat to their cause, because Jews are thought to be able to mix much more easily than other ethnic groups.

Politically, socially and economically, white supremacy was common in the United States before the American Civil War and for decades after. The same is true of apartheid in South Africa and of parts of Europe at different time periods; importantly under Nazi Germany's Third Reich. The amount and nature of white supremacy's influence in western culture is a subject of ongoing debate. In some parts of the United States, many people who were considered non-white could not vote and were barred from government office, and prevented from holding most government jobs — well into the second half of the twentieth century. White leaders often viewed Native Americans and Australian Aborigines as obstacles to progress, rather than as settlers in their own right. Many European-settled countries at the Pacific Ocean limited immigration from the Asian Pacific countries. Many U.S. states banned marriage between races, through "anti-miscegenation laws" until 1967, when these laws were changed. South Africa maintained its white supremacist-like Apartheid system until the early 1990s.

White supremacists have become linked with a racist part of the skinhead subculture, despite the fact that when the skinhead scene first developed in the United Kingdom in the late 1960s, it was heavily influenced by Jamaican rude boys and British mods. By the 1980s, 
a large white power skinhead faction had formed.

White supremacist groups can be found in most countries and regions with a large white population, including North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Latin America. In all of these locations, their views represent a small amount of the population, and active membership of the groups is quite small. However, a backlash to the non-white immigrants into various European nations has caused a rise in membership in such organizations, as well as an increase in militant white supremacist demonstrations. The militant approach taken by white supremacist groups has caused them to be watched closely by law enforcement officials. Some European countries have laws stopping hate speech, as well as other laws that ban or restrict some white supremacist organizations but not all.

The Christian Identity movement, which is regarded by other branches of Christianity as heretical, is closely tied to white supremacy. Although the Ku Klux Klan's reasons for supporting racial segregation are not primarily based on religious ideals, some Klan groups are openly Christian Protestant because of their northern European/Germanic roots.
Some white supremacists identify themselves as Odinists, although most Odinists reject white supremacy, and white supremacists make up only a small fraction of those who support Odinism (belief in the gods of Norse mythology). Some white supremacist groups, such as the South African Boeremag, conflate elements of Christianity and Odinism.

The World Church of the Creator, now called the Creativity Movement promotes a federally-recognized racial religious creed called Creativity. The basic ideology is based on the idea of a sound mind in a sound body in a sound society in a sound environment. The religion is dedicated to the "survival, expansion and advancement of the white race" and "building a whiter and brighter world." Central to this is a unique "holy war" referred to as "RAHOWA" is which members of the white race must take steps to preserve their white race. They believe that all races are at enmity with each other for territory and natural resources and their war is a religious war. They are not Christian and essentially atheistic agnostic.

Vulcan was a theoretical planet. In the 19th century, the planet was thought to orbit close to the sun. Its gravitational pull would explain changes seen between the perihelion advance of Mercury from that predicted by Classical Mechanics. The theory that Vulcan exists come from the earlier prediction that an outer planet (now Neptune) was causing similar changes in the orbit of Uranus from the orbit predicted by classical theory.

None of the searches for Vulcan found a planet. This caused some people to not agree with Newtonian theory. It lead to the development of Special Relativity and General Relativity. Albert Einstein's modified theory of gravity showed why the orbit of Mercury changes without the existence of Vulcan. This disproved the theories of Vulcan.

This flag has been used since 1822, when the young Greek state was fighting for its independence from the Ottoman Empire during the Greek War of Independence.

The current flag of Greece was officially adopted during the First national assembly of the Greeks at Epidaurus in 1822, and the flag with the 9 stripes was adopted as a state and military ensign (a flag used only by the government and the military, and only on ships). Another flag was chosen as a land flag, it was a simple white cross on a blue field. A third flag was adopted for the merchant fleet (a flag to be used by civilians on ships only), but it was only used for 8 years. In 1978, the ensign was chosen as the sole national flag, and it is now used by everyone on land and sea as the flag of Greece.

It is sometimes known in Greece as the "blue-white", in Greek "Γαλανόλευκη" (Galanólefki) or "Κυανόλευκη" (Kyanólefki).

A computer model is a computer program that is designed to simulate what might or what did happen in a situation. They are used in many ways including in astronomy, economics and sciences such as physics and biology. Computer models are used in fields such as earthquake performance simulation and making models of buildings.

Well known areas which use computer models:

Computer modelling often uses numerical mathematics to approximate the real solution of the problem. Simulation techniques are then used to get values. Numerical weather forecasts are too inaccurate to give a good local prediction of the weather. Depending on the model, an area of several square kilometers may be modeled with only a few data points. As a result, the prediction is rarely more accurate than the model used at the start.

The temperature in Labuan, which lies in the tropics, hardly changes through the year. Instead of summers and winters, there is a dry season in the beginning of the year, followed by a wet season with a lot of rain. Cuzco, which also lies near the equator, but at high altitude, is much dryer. Like in Labuan, the daily high temperature barely changes through the year, but because of the altitude, nights are much colder than days, especially in the dry months from May to August.

Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll

The Princess Louise (Louise Caroline Alberta: Marquess of Lorne and Duchess of Argyll by marriage; 18 March 1858 – 3 December 1939) was the fourth daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. She was interested in sculpture, and was a notable architect. In 1871, she married John, Marquess of Lorne (Duke of Argyll from 1900), but the marriage was unhappy. They made up with each other in the 1900s, and after Argyll's death in 1914, she had a nervous breakdown. She died in 1939 at the age of 91. 

Louise was born at Buckingham Palace, the main British royal home in London. Her mother was Queen Victoria, and her father was Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Louise spent much of her early life moving between the different royal homes that her parents stayed in. These included Buckingham Palace; Osborne House on the Isle of Wight; Windsor Castle in Berkshire; and Balmoral Castle in Scotland. 

Louise's education was similar to her brothers and sisters. She was given a basic education, as well as tasks such as cookery, carpentry and farming. She was good at art, especially sculpture. Hallam Tennyson, son of the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson, wrote that Louise could "draw beautifully". She was also good at acting and dancing. The Queen wrote that Louise "danced the sword dance with more verve and accuracy than any of her sisters". She wanted to know about a lot of things, which gave her the nickname "Little Miss Why" from members of the royal family.

Louise's father, Prince Albert, became ill with typhoid fever, and died on 14 December 1861. Queen Victoria was very sad after this happened, as she and Albert were a loving couple. While the Queen mourned, the court became morbid, and Louise quickly became fed up with it. On her 17th birthday, she asked if the ballroom could be opened for a dance, but Queen Victoria refused. Louise's irritation, in turn, irritated the Queen, who did not like Louise's arguments.

The Queen never really got over Albert's death, but she made herself feel better by sticking to Albert's plans for her children's marriages. In 1862, Louise's sister, Princess Alice, married Prince Louis of Hesse; in 1863, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales married Princess Alexandra of Denmark; and in 1866, Princess Helena married Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. With Louise's elder sisters now married, Louise was left to be the Queen's helper. Despite not being happy about it, the Queen agreed with this, and was surprised by the results. The Queen wrote: "She is (and who would some years ago have thought it?) a clever dear girl with a fine strong character, unselfish and affectionate." In her new role, Louise was less bored by the court, because she had more things to do.

United States presidential election, 1996

Some felt the 1996 Presidential Election could be relatively close pending upon what kind of an impact third party candidate Ross Perot would play, as well as with the backdrop of White Water which was the talk of the Spring of 1996. In a public opinion poll taken in early May, President Clinton stood at 52%, thus making him a vulnerable incumbent.Through it all President Clinton gained a head of steam with a campaign that ran on the platform of "Peace and Prosparity". As for the GOP, Sen. Bob Dole never really got going while dumping his original running mate Lamar Alexander for Jack Kemp. This was a move that left many Republicans scratching their heads. On November 5, 1996 President Clinton garnered a substantial plurality of the National vote while carrying enough states to give him 379 Electoral Votes,(49%) Nationally while the Kansas Senator Bob Dole had 159 Electoral Votes (41%) Nationally. Despite the impressive victory by President Clinton he became the first incumbent President since Woodrow Wilson in 1916 to win re-election while failing to hit the 50% mark for the evening. The Republicans would gain a few more seats in both houses of Congress.

The United States presidential election of 1996 was a contest between the Democratic national ticket of President Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Vice President Al Gore of Tennessee and the Republican national ticket of former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas for President and former Congressman and ex-Cabinet Secretary Jack Kemp of New York for Vice President. Businessman Ross Perot ran as candidate for the Reform Party with economist Pat Choate as his running mate: he received less media attention and was excluded from the presidential debates and, while still obtaining substantial results for a third-party candidate, by U.S. standards, did not renew his success in the 1992 election. Clinton benefited from an economy which recovered from the early 1990s recession, and a relatively stable world stage. On November 5, 1996, President Clinton went on to win re-election by a substantial popular vote margin with a large electoral college victory.

President William Jefferson Clinton went on to win re-election relatively easily despite becoming the first sitting President since Woodrow in 1916 to do so with under 50% of the National Vote (49%), while winning enough states to earn him 379 Electoral Votes. Sen. Robert Dole from Knasas ran for the Republicans and was at the mercy of peaceful over sea's relations and a thriving economy. He gained (41%) of the vote, while winning enough states to win 159 electoral votes. The GOP did well in the congressional races however thus effectively positioning themselves for the 1998 mid terms and the subsequent 2000 race for the White House.

Deccan Plateau

The Deccan Plateau is a large plateau in India which covers the majority of the southern part of the country. It is located between three mountain ranges and extends over eight Indian states; in particular the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu lie on this plateau. 

The plateau covers 4,22,000 sq. km., 43 percent of India's landmass.

The , areas of higher land, make up a triangle nested within the familiar downward-pointing triangle of the Indian sub-continent's coastline. In the south of India the plateau is mostly over 1,000 metres (m) above sea level. In the north it is mostly about 500 m above sea level. 
The plateau is very big and there are many habitats: different Ecosystems with different sorts of vegetation, climate, geology and animals. The forests on the plateau are older than the Himalayan mountains.

On the west of the plateau are the Western Ghats and in the east are the Eastern Ghats. These mountain ranges rise from their respective nearby coastal plains and nearly meet at the southern tip of India. The mountains make the southward-pointing vertex of a triangle. The northern boundary of the triangle is made up by the Satpura Range and Vindhya Range. These northern ranges separate the plateau from the heavily populated riverine plains of northern India.

The name is an anglicised from the Prakrit word "dakkhin". That word comes from the Sanskrit word "dakṣiṇa-" (), meaning 'South' or 'The South'.

The Deccan Traps are a main cause of the special geography and geology of South India. They are a large igneous province located on the Deccan Plateau of west-central India (between 17–24N, 73–74E) and one of the largest volcanic features on Earth. They consist of multiple layers of solidified flood basalt that together are more than thick and cover an area of 500,000 km2 (193,051 sq mi). The term 'trap', used in geology for such rock formations, is derived from the Dutch word for stairs, referring to the step-like hills forming the landscape of the region.

The Deccan Traps formed between 60 and 68 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period. The bulk of the volcanic eruption occurred at the Western Ghats (near Mumbai) some 66 million years ago. This series of eruptions may have lasted fewer than 30,000 years in total. The gases released in the process may have played a role in the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event, which included the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. The consensus among the scientific community is that the extinction was triggered by the Chicxulub impact event in Central America, but that the Deccan eruptions also damaged the world's environment.

Before the Deccan Traps region was reduced to its current size by erosion and plate tectonics, it is estimated that the original area covered by the lava flows was as large as 1.5 million km², approximately half the size of modern India. The present area of directly observable lava flows is estimated to be around 512,000km (nearly 200,000 sq miles).

The release of volcanic gases, particularly sulfur dioxide, during the formation of the traps contributed to contemporary climate change. Data point to an average fall in temperature of 2°C in this period.

The insect family Mantophasmatidae is the sole family in its order. It is a group of African carnivorous insects discovered in 2002.

The most common vernacular name for this order is gladiators, but it is not well known under any name. 

Their modern centre of endemism is western South Africa and Namibia, although a relict population and Eocene fossils suggest a wider ancient distribution.

Members of the order are wingless even as adults, making them relatively difficult to identify. They resemble a mix between praying mantids and phasmids. Molecular evidence indicates that they are most closely related to a family known as the Grylloblattidae.

The mantophasmids were originally described from old museum specimens that found in Namibia ("Mantophasma zephyrum") and Tanzania ("M. subsolanum"), and from a 45-million-year-old specimen of Baltic amber ("Raptophasma kerneggeri").

The most recent classification recognizes numerous genera, including fossils.

Of the total population of Jammu, more than two-thirds are classed as Hindus; of these the greater number live in the southeastern portion of the Kashmir region of Pakistan. Culturally, ethnically, and linguistically, they are closely related to the Punjabi-speaking peoples in Punjab (Pakistan) province, and many speak the Dogri language. The majority of the state’s Sikhs also live in the Jammu region. To the northwest, however, the proportion of Muslims increases, with Muslims making up a dominant majority in the area around the western town of Poonch District.

Jammu is the only region in Kashmir that has a Hindu majority population. 71% of Jammu's population practices Hinduism while 24% practices Islam.

Approximately 67% of the population is Dogra. Majority of the Hindus are either Dogras or people who migrated from Kotli, Mirpur, and the Kashmir Valley. Some Hindus are of Punjabi descent. the Sikhs are of Punjabi descent. Jammu's Occupied Kashmir is well connected with the rest of India by rail, road and air, making it far better connected than the rest of the occupied territories.

Late-2000s financial crisis

The Late-2000s financial crisis is an ongoing economic crisis. Many economists say that it is the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression during the 1930s. Many important businesses have shut down because of it, which has caused many people to lose their jobs. This means that people have been buying less, which is very bad for the economy.

There are many reasons economists think this happened. Most economists believe that it started in the United States. From 1997 to 2006, people bought very expensive houses even though they did not have enough money. But because of the money coming in to the U.S. from other countries, it was easy to have good credit. People used this credit for expensive home loans. This created a housing bubble, which made the price of houses rise more. Because they had a lot of money, the loaning companies made it easier to get a loan, even if the borrower didn't have a good credit history. These loans are called subprime loans.

During this time, many refinanced their homes. This means that their mortgage was changed so that they had lower interest. After they refinanced, homeowners could take out another mortgage to use as spending money. The loaning companies changed their loans so that they had low interest at first, which would increase later. This is called adjustable rate mortgage. The companies did this to try to convince more people to take loans. Many people with subprime loans also took these adjustable rate mortgages, hoping that the good price of housing would help them refinance later.

While the housing prices were still high, many American and European companies, including banks, invested in subprime loans. These investments gave more money to the loaning companies, who used it to give out more subprime loans. These investments would make a lot of money as long as the prices of housing was high. 

However, the housing companies built too many houses. This caused the price of housing to decrease beginning in the summer of 2006. When this happened, many people were paying more money than their homes were worth. This is called negative equity. About 8.8 million homeowners in the U.S. had 0 or negative equity by March 2008. This caused the number of foreclosures on homes to increase, meaning that many people lost their homes. During 2007, almost 1.3 million U.S. homes could be foreclosed on. The number of houses for sale continued to increase, which made the prices decrease. The homeowners with subprime loans left their houses with less value than they had when they were bought, which meant that the loans were worth more money than the house. This meant that the loaning companies were not able to make money from these houses.

The collapse of the housing bubble caused the value of investments to fall. The companies that had invested in subprime loans lost a total of about $512 billion. Citigroup and Merrill Lynch were two of the companies which lost the most money. More than half of the money lost, $260 billion, was lost by American firms.

Hershey–Chase experiment

The Hershey–Chase experiments were a series of experiments started in 1952 by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase. 

These experiments were to make sure that DNA was the genetic material which had been discovered by the Swiss physician Friedrich Miescher in his experiments on white blood cells or leukocytes between 1868 and 1869.
Hershey shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his “discoveries concerning the genetic structure of viruses.”

Hershey and Chase used T2 phage, a bacteriophage, for their experiments. The phage infects a bacterium by attaching to it and injecting its genetic material into it.

They put labels on phage DNA with radioactive Phosphorus-32. They then followed the phages while they infected E. coli. They found that the radioactive element was only in the bacteria, and not in the phage.

In a second experiment, they put labels on the phage protein with radioactive Sulfur-35. After the phage was attached to the bacterium, the radioactive element was found in the phage, but not in the bacteria. This showed them that genetic material which infects the bacteria is DNA.

Don McLean

Don McLean (born October 2, 1945) is an American singer and songwriter. He is most well-known for the songs "American Pie" and "Vincent".

In his early career, Don Mclean mainly played folk music. He sang folk songs and played simple chords with acoustic guitar and harmonica. In 1969, Don Mclean joined folk singer Pete Seeger in the environment campaign. They gave talks and playing concerts to help people know some of the problems with the environment. Also in the same year, Don McLean released his first album "Tapestry". This album was not very successful. McLean continued to perform in many small places.

In 1971, Don Mclean released an 8-minute-long song named "American Pie". The song was dedicated to Don McLean’s music hero Buddy Holly. Much of the song was about the deaths of Holly, Richie Valens and J.P. Richardson ("The Big Bopper") in 1959. It also dealt with many important events in American history. Quickly "American Pie" became the number 1 song in the United States. Don Mclean became a superstar and drew many audiences to his concerts. In 2005, "American Pie" was voted 5th in the "365 songs of the century" list. His second single "Vincent", featuring Vincent Van Gogh's masterpiece "Starry Night", also topped the UK and US charts in 1971. The song is played in Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam every day.

In the later 1970s, Don McLean tried other styles of songs. He was not as popular with these other styles. Bad sales of albums caused him to change recording companies from one to another. Finally, in 1980, Don McLean regained his popularity by playing "Crying", a song first sang by Roy Orbison. The song reached the first place in UK chart. 

Don McLean is not as popular today as he was before. He is still writing and singing his own songs and performing in concerts.

The famous guitar player, Eric Clapton, spoke highly of Don McLean’s guitar playing skill after listening to his guitar performance. Also, Don McLean’s performance on stage once inspired Lori Lieberman to write the 1974 Grammy-winning song "Killing me softly with his song". Most of the successive folk singers entitled him with "US legend"

Diacritic

A diacritic () (for example, an "accent") is a mark put above, below, through or on a letter. The word comes from the Greek diakritikos = 'distinguishing'.

Usually, it affects the way the word is said (pronounced). Most diacritics concern pronunciation because alphabets do not describe the sounds of words exactly. Diacritics are rare in English, but common in many other languages.

Letter e: common are the acute accent é (rising voice, as in the French word née), grave accent è (lowering voice); "élève" has (from the left) acute, grave and silent e. The cidilla ç denotes a soft c. 

A different principle is illustrated by the circumflex î. This denotes loss of letter: eg maistre (Middle French) > maître (modern French). Thus its function is historical. 

In Spanish the acute accent simply signals stress, e.g. "educación". There the stress is on the last vowel, not on the second to last. Second to last vowel (syllable) is the usual position for stress in spoken Spanish. It is usually not signalled by an accent. 

The tilde ñ is pronounced like ny, and counts as a letter in their dictionaries, coming after n.

The umlaut ü in German is pronounced ue, and is less used in modern German. Historical name-spellings should always keep the umlaut if it was used for that name.

The Scandinavian languages treat the characters with diacritics ä, ö and å as new and separate letters of the alphabet, and sort them after z. Usually ä is sorted as equal to æ (ash) and ö is sorted as equal to ø (o-slash). Also, aa, when used as an alternative spelling to å, is sorted as such. Other letters modified by diacritics are treated as variants of the underlying letter, with the exception that ü is frequently sorted as y.

Scripts such are the semitic languages Arabic and Hebrew have a wide variety of diacritics. This is partly because the semitic languages were originally formed without separate letters for vowels, and partly because some of the languages (Arabic in particular) is spoken in a number of dialects. 

The diacritics in Hebrew and Arabic are not always used, however.

George A. Romero

George Andrew Romero (born February 4, 1940) is an American director, writer, editor and actor. He is known for his horror movies with zombie themes.

Romero was born in New York City to a Cuban-American father and a Lithuanian-American mother. 

Romero went to Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University. After graduating in 1960, he started directing short films and commercials before moving onto horror films. He and friends started a directing group called "Image Ten Productions" in the 1960s, and they made "Night of the Living Dead" (1968). The movie was directed by Romero and written with John A. Russo. It became a cult classic.

Later, Romero made "There's Always Vanilla" (1971), "Jack's Wife / Season of the Witch" (1972) and "The Crazies" (1973) and "Martin" (1977). These films were not as popular as "Night of the Living Dead".

In 1978, Romero made another zombie film called "Dawn of the Dead" (1978). The film made over $55 million and was named one of the top cult films by "Entertainment Weekly" in 2003. Romero made a third zombie film called "Day of the Dead" (1985), which was less popular.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Romero made other films such as "Monkey Shines" (1988) (about a killer helper monkey), "Two Evil Eyes" (1990), "The Dark Half" (1993) and "Bruiser" (2000) (about a man whose face becomes a blank mask).

In 1998, Romero made a commercial for Resident Evil 2.

Universal Studios made a of "Dawn of the Dead" in 2004, without Romero.

Romero is separated from his wife, Christine Forrest. They have two children together.

Romero chose his favourite top ten films of all time as: "The Brothers Karamazov", "Casablanca", "Dr. Strangelove", "High Noon", "King Solomon's Mines" (1950), "North by Northwest", "The Quiet Man", "Repulsion", "Touch of Evil" and "The Tales of Hoffman". "The Tales of Hoffman" is Romero's "favourite film of all time; the movie that made me want to make movies."

Languages of Singapore

There are a many languages spoken in Singapore. The reason is that Singapore has a multi-racial society. The Singapore government recognises four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. The national language is Malay, while English is mainly used as the business and working language. The colloquial patois spoken on the streets is a creole called Singlish amongst the locals, but is also known amongst academics in linguistics as Singapore Colloquial English.

English was introduced to Singapore by the British in 1819, when the British established a port later a colony on the island. English had been the administrative language of the colonial government, and when Singapore gained self-government in 1959 and independence in 1965, the local government decided to keep English as the working language. 
The use of English as a common language serves to bridge the gap between the diverse ethnic groups in Singapore. 

In schools, students are also required to take a Mother Tongue class, where they are either taught Mandarin Chinese, Malay or Tamil. 

As a result, most Singaporeans have at least conversational ability and basic literacy in a minimum of two languages, while many more are conversant in three or more languages, English, their assigned Mother Tongue, and the language that is used at home.

About 60% of Singapore's Indian population speaks Tamil as their native language. Other Indian languages include Malayalam and Hindi.

There are around 5,000 Peranakans living on the island, and they still use the Hokkien-influenced Malay dialect called Baba Malay.

A handful of Portuguese Eurasians still speak a Portuguese-creole known as Papia Kristang. The most fluent speakers however, come from the pre-war generation.

The Sino-Tibetan languages form a language family composed of, at least, the Chinese and the Tibeto-Burman languages, including some 250 languages of East Asia. They are second only to the Indo-European languages in terms of their number of speakers.

A few scholars, most prominently Christopher Beckwith and Roy Andrew Miller, argue that Chinese is not related to Tibeto-Burman. They point to an absence of regular sound correspondences, an absence of reconstructable shared morphology, and evidence that much shared lexical material has been borrowed from Chinese into Tibeto-Burman. In opposition to this view, scholars in favor of the Sino-Tibetan hypothesis such as W. South Coblin, Graham Thurgood, James Matisoff, and Gong Hwang-cherng have argued that there are regular correspondences in sounds as well as in grammar.

Hermit crab

The hermit crab is a type of crab that does not have a very hard shell. Not a true crab, they uses other animals' old shells for protection; they especially like old whelk shells. As the hermit crab grows in size, it must find a larger shell.

The hermit crab is a crustacean, but it is very different from other crustaceans. While most crustaceans are covered from head to tail with a hard exoskeleton, the hermit crab is missing part of its exoskeleton. The back part where its abdomen is located, is soft and squishy. Thus, the minute a hermit crab molts into an adult, it sets out to find a shell in which to live.

To get into the shell, the hermit crab squeezes in backwards, securing itself with its four back legs. The back legs have hooks that anchor the hermit crab into the shell without difficulty. The next four legs are used for walking, while the front two are its chelipeds. The chelipeds are not equal in size: one is big and other is small. The larger one is used for grabbing prey and guarding the entrance to its shell. All together, hermit crabs have a total of ten legs, including the chelipeds and the rear legs used to anchor to the shell.

There are about 500 different species of hermit crabs around the world, and they have different colors, often with patterns like stripes and dots on their bodies. Most hermit crab species live on the ocean floor, but many live on land. Female terrestrial (land based) hermit crabs must return to the sea to breed.

Hermit crabs are omnivores (eating plants and animals) and scavengers (eating dead animals that they find). They eat worms, plankton, and organic debris.

Hermit crabs first appeared in the Cretaceous period, before the Dinosaurs became extinct (died out). Fossils have been found where they have used Ammonite shells.

The reproductive (sexual) organs of hermit crabs are located near and just below the animal's heart and open to the outside at the base of the last pair of walking legs in the male. In the female, they are located at the base of the middle pair of walking legs. Female hermit crabs usually lay their eggs shortly after copulating, (having sex) but they can also store sperm (male sexual cell) for many months. The eggs are fertilised as they are laid by passing through the chamber holding the sperm. The eggs are carried and hatched in a mass attached to the abdomen inside the shell. The number of eggs is usually large, but depends on the animal's size.

Alex Salmond studied at the University of St Andrews and became an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland. Salmond became a Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Banff and Buchan at the 1987 General Election. In 1990, Alex Salmond became the leader of the Scottish National Party. He became a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Banff and Buchan at the 1999 Scottish Parliament Election and resigned as SNP leader in 2000.

Salmond became the party leader again in 2004 and stood in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election for the constituency of Gordon. At this election, the SNP received the highest number of seats and the highest share of the vote in Scotland, but did not have enough seats to form a majority government. The SNP then formed a minority government with Alex Salmond as First Minister.

Alex Salmond was against the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was one of several MPs who called for Prime Minister Tony Blair to be impeached. At the 2010 General Election, Alex Salmond stood down as a Member of Parliament but argued against the BBC's decision not to allow the SNP on the televised Prime Ministerial Debates.

Radio signal

Waves are composed of frequency, amplitude and wave form. It is equal to voices. High frequency wave has high pitched tone. Also wave that has big amplitude has loud sound. By using microphone, voices are converted to electronic signals. And transmit tower transmit the electrocic signals to air. The electronic signal is catched by a receiving set. By using a speaker, the electronic signal is changed to voice. When the signal is transmitted, telecaster amplify and alter the signals. By altering, the signal is changed to high frequency wave. So we can not hear radio signals.
by using radio signal, we can communicate with other people in a long distance. because radio signal has high speed (340m/s) and ,because of high frequency, radio signal do not damp easily.
when modulate voice to radio signal, there are two way. the amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM). 
Amplitude modulation (AM) do not change frequency. It change amplitude like a voice's wave form. The using circuit is simple and the length that radio signal can reach is long. but it has a weak point. the radio wave can easily damaged by another waves.
frequency modulation (FM) means, frequency is changed like voice's wave form. it is contrast to Amplitude modulation (AM). Amplitude modulation's (AM) weak point would be a strong point of frequency modulation (FM). also Amplitude modulation's (AM) strong point would be a weak point of frequency modulation (FM).

The radio signals are used to radio, Television, cell phone.
radio, international broad casting, aeronautical radio and vision of television use amplitude modulation (AM) to deliver.
in contrast voice of television and stereo broad casting use frequency modulation (FM) to deliver

<doc id="143936" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143936" title="Triode">
Triode

A triode is a type of vacuum tube. It differs from a vacuum tube diode, which has only two electrodes, by having a third electrode, called the grid between the cathode and anode. 

When the cathode is heated, it gives out electrons. Then, the anode absorbs electrons. This process makes an electric current, which is controlled by the grid. The addition of the grid allows the triode to be used as an amplifier.

Lee De Forest invented this device in 1908 from his original two-electrode Audion of 1906. The triode incorporates the key principle of amplification. The name triode emerged because people needed to distinguish it from other similar vacuum tubes (for example, diodes, tetrodes, pentodes, etc.)

The triode can not only do amplification but also work as part of an oscillator (making waves) and detecting waves. It is used in radios, but the transistor has mostly replaced it starting in the 1960s. It is an ancestor of the transistor. It is still used in vacuum tube amplifiers.

Balti language

Balti (بلتی) is a language spoken in Baltistan, in the Northern Areas of Pakistan and adjoining parts of the disputed territory of Indian-administered Kashmir. Before 1948 Baltistan was part of Ladakh province. The language is a sub-dialect of Ladakhi and an archaic dialect of the Tibetan language, but many of the consonants that are silent in most modern Tibetan dialects are pronounced in Balti.

All people of different races, living in Baltistan are called Balti. Greeks used the word Byaltae instead of sBal-ti, which in Tibetan means water gorge. The historian Ptolemy who was also a general in the army of Alexander the Great had named the region (Byaltae) in his book. Baltistan is the Persian translation of "Baltiyul", “The Homeland of Balti”. The people belonging to Balti nationality are settled on both banks of the river Indus from Kargil (in the east) to Haramosh (in the west) and from Karakoram range (in the north) to Deosai plains (in the south). In this nationality the majority comes from Tibetan origin. However people migrated to this area in different periods of ancient times, on account of different reasons and after merging in the prevailing Tibetan society, gave birth to a new civilisation. All these multi-racial groups speak Balti language, which is a branch of the ancient Tibetan language. However in some rural areas, the Sheen people still speak Shina language.

The Balti are a very forbearing, cheerful, and hospitable people. But during the Rmakpon reign (from 12th century to 1840 A.D.) they invaded Ladakh and Tibet many times.

There are several Balti communities in Pakistan's urban areas farther south, that is in Lahore, Islamabad, in Karachi and other places.

The Balti language has kept may words like all the Tibetan dialects and many other languages. Below are a few examples:

Raja

A Raja (Sanskrit "राजा" (rājā), also spelled Rajah) is a monarch, or princely ruler of the Kshatriya varna.

The title has a long history in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, as it is found in the Rigveda. It can also be used as a name for non-royal Indians.
In Pakistan, Raja is still used by many Muslim Rajput clans as titles. "Raja" is also used as a name by Hindus and Sikhs.

Headset

A headset is a headphone with a microphone. People can listen to sound with headphone and can record sound with a microphone. A headset is easy to use because it can be used without hands, just like a telephone. A person only needs to put the headset on his/her head and then can talk with a mic. Many people use headsets at the computer so they can converse and type easily. Headsets normally have only one speaker like a telephone, but also can be made with speakers for both ears.

Nowadays there are wire headset and wireless headset, which means there's no line between the computer and the headset. A wireless headset can be put in a pocket or a bag easily due to its small size. This can be used for soundproofing in a game show or quiz show.

The inventor of the headset is Nathaniel Baldwin, but his version couldn't be sold to people. 
The second headset is the US Army's headset for airplane pilots in World War I.

Headset is made up of two parts. They are input part and output part. From input part, headset receive sound signal. And from output part, headset receive sound signal and generate sound.

Endoscopy

Endoscopy means to "look inside" and often means looking inside the body for medical reasons using an instrument called an endoscope.
Endoscope is a medical instrument that is made to see parts inside of the patient's body such as the stomach and intestines. It has a long tube to enter the patient's body and a tiny camera attached to the front of this tube. It is usually inserted into patient's nose, mouth, or anus, then organs that doctors want to see are photographed by the camera.
General kinds of the scopes are bronchoscope, esophagoscope, gastroscope, duodenoscope, rectoscope, cystoscope, laperoscope, and so on. And thoracoscope, mediastinoscope, cardioscope are specially used.
Endoscopes are divided into some types. One consists of a long tube to see with the naked eye through this tube. Another is based on lens system. The third is used to insert camera into the patient's body. And the forth is called fiberscope using glass fiber.

<doc id="143980" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143980" title="Hydrogen car">
Hydrogen car

A Hydrogen car is a vehicle that uses hydrogen as its fuel for motive power. A Hydrogen car does not have to be a car, it can be any transportation vehicle that uses hydrogen in a similar way, like an aircraft.

Hydrogen Energy

Hydrogen is the simplest and the most abundant element in the universe. Even though it's simple and there's so much of it, hydrogen does not occur naturally as a gas on the earth: it's always combined with other things. Hydrogen is high in energy, yet an engine that burns pure hydrogen produces almost no pollution.

(1) Advantages of hydrogen energy

- We can get hydrogen from water by splitting it into oxygen and hydrogen, so supplies are almost limitless.

- As hydrogen is a diatomic molecule, the product of combustion is only water. Therefore, it does not produce the harmful gasses that gasoline and diesel cars produce, such as carbon dioxide.

- Hydrogen itself is not poisonous. Therefore, in case of outflow, hydrogen is safer than any other gas.

(2) Disadvantages of hydrogen energy

- It's hard to store the large amount that is required to fuel a car

- Hydrogen is often taken from unrenewable resources, like fossil fuels.

The principles of Hydrogen Car

(1) What is a Fuel Cell?

In principle, fuel cells are electrochemical devices like batteries that convert the chemical energy of a fuel directly and very efficiently into electricity (DC) and heat, thus doing away with combustion. Unlike a battery, a fuel cell does not run down or require recharging. It will produce energy in the form of electricity and heat as long as fuel is supplied.

(2) What is the Principle?

A fuel cell consists of two electrodes sandwiched around an electrolyte. Oxygen passes over one electrode and hydrogen over the other, generating electricity water and heat. Layers of materials with distinct electrochemical properties are sandwiched together to form a single galvanic cell. At the heart lies a membrane that can only be crossed by charged molecules. Gas-permeable electrodes coated with a catalyst adhere to this membrane, adding a layer on either side. There electrodes are in turn connected to a device that can utilize electricity. Hydrogen gas flows into channels on one face of the cell and migrates through that electrode, while the same occurs with oxygen gas along the opposite electrode. Spurred by a catalyst, favorable chemistry causes the hydrogen to oxidize into hydrogen protons and give up its electrons to the neighboring electrode, which thereby becomes the anode. this buildup of negative charge then follows the path of least resistance via the external circuit to the other electrode. It is this flow of electrons through a circuit that creates elecricity.

Problem to solve for the practical use of hydrogen car

Most important problem involved in the practical use of hydrogen car is hydrogen storage materials. If it uses a fuel cell that generates electricity through reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, it does not matter. However, if method is that hydrogen is sprayed to internal-combustion engine, it does matter. Now hydrogen storage tank with highest possibility is method using metal hydride. Metal hydride is that reversible reaction between metal and hydrogen make new form of compound. Now Hydrogen storing technology using Hydrogen storage compound metal comes to practical use step in the side of technical, however, hydrogen storing capacity per weight is no match for demand of user, so this technology does not wide use yet. Therefore, that problem should be solved.

Standard-definition television

Standard-Definition Television is a kind of television system that provides lower resolution than HDTV and higher resolution than analog TV does. 
The word 'SDTV' is generally used at the digital television broadcasting system that has a similar or litle bit higher state of resolution to the 'analog television system'. Digital broadcasting system uses digital signals when they receive sound and movie. It is compared to analog TV that uses analog signals.

According to a ATSC standard, SDTV broadcasts in three ways.
First, at ratio of length and width 16:9 and resolution 704x480.
Second, at ratio 4:3 and resolution 704x480 
Lastly, at ratio 4:3 and resolution 640x480.
The first one has best quality, second one is next, and the last one is the worst.
The Screen's frame can be 24, 30, 60 per second. These are similar level with DVD.
As I mentioned at the 'Definition' tab, it has a better resolution than analog TV system, and has lower resolution than HDTV.
Because it is kind of digital boadcasting system, it can broadcast not only analog TV program but also HDTV program(Of course there exists a difference in resolution). It is compared to anlog TV that can't broadcast HDTV program.

SDTV has a similar state of resolution compared to analog TV. But SDTV is more vivid than
analog TV because it has less noise. And it has better sound. The point that SDTV uses a digital broadcasting system makes SDTV have many accompaning functions. For example, multitasking, electronic program guide, and so on. This functions are 
imposible at analog TV. Compared to HDTV, it has lower resolution. But in fact, HDTV programs are not spread widely yet, and the cheaper price of SDTV makes consumers to use SDTV.

Generally, there are three types of TV. They are analog TV, SDTV and HDTV.Price : AnalogTV < SDTV < HDTVQuality : AnalogTV ≒ SDTV < HDTVAnalogTV only can be compatible with analog signals, but both SDTV and HDTV can be compatible with not only analog but also digital signals.

<doc id="144002" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144002" title="Thermocouple">
Thermocouple

Thermocouple, TC for short, is a device that converts heat directly into electricity. A thermocouple can also work in reverse - using an electric current to transform into heat as well as cold.

Imagine that two wires made of different types of metal are connected at one end. If the junction of the two wires is heated, electricity will flow through the wire. 

Electrons, when heated, will begin to cross the junction on their own. Because of the different properties of the different metals, the electrons will lose potential energy and gain kinetic energy, just like a ball rolling over a hill to a lower area. Although the voltage created by a thermocouple is very small (in the millivolt range), many thermocouples can be hooked together to make a larger voltage. This is called a thermopile.

Thermocouples do not only generate electricity from heat. They can also generate heat from electricity, and even cold from electricity. If two different wires are connected at both ends, and some voltage source makes current flow through the loop, one junction will get very hot and the other junction will get as cold as ice. The electrons at the hot junction are gaining kinetic energy as they cross the junction. This is why they make the metal hot. The electrons at the cold junction are losing kinetic energy as they cross the junction. This is why they make the junction get cold.

Interestingly, it is difficult to measure the precise voltage that a thermocouple is producing when heat is applied to its junction. This is because any voltmeter wires that are connected to the thermocouple will probably be made of a different material than the wires of a thermocouple. This means that the connection between the voltmeter and the thermoucouple is itself another thermocouple. Engineers designing microchips face the problem that virtually every electrical connection on a microchip is a thermocouple whether they want it to be or not.

Gas heaters with pilot flames are one of the most famous examples for the use of thermocouples. Thermocouples are stacked to make a thermopile, which can generate enough voltage from the heat of the pilot flame to keep the gas valve open which in turn supplies the gas for the pilot flame. If the gas runs out, the flame extinguishes and the voltage across the thermopile decreases, which causes the electric gas valve to close. Thermocouples are also used in other ways. For instance, they monitor temperatures in air conditioning and refrigerators, and of CPUs in computers, which could be destroyed by overheating.

There are hundreds of thermocouples, but only 8 of them are standardized internationally.Type E (chromel–constantan), type J (iron–constantan), type N (nicrosil–nisil), type T (copper–constantan) and type K (chromel–alumel) are base metals.Types B, R, and S thermocouples use platinum or a platinum–rhodium.

Wikipedia:Schools/Projects

The Schools/projects gives school students a chance to write articles for the Simple English Wikipedia. Often articles written by students are deleted quickly because the are badly written, with poor spelling, and not formatted properly. This can be hard for students when the article is deleted before they have had a chance to finish it. This can be hard for teachers when the student's work is deleted before they have had a chance to correct it. The Schools/Projects guidelines have been written to fix these problems. Please read the "" which will answer many questions about using the Wikipedia with students.

1. Create a school project: give a name, a description and an end date for the project on this page, (). This should include the names of all the pages, and a wikipedia editor who can be contacted if things go wrong. (see list below) There should be a point of contact for the project in case of any problems that may come up. This is usually one of the teachers.

2. Tag project pages: add this tag to the top of students pages: , 

3. Use the sand box: have the students make their own sandbox, there are instructions on this page . There is also a link at the bottom of every edit page. This is a User page where users can write their article and work on it until it is ready to be put onto the wiki. Wiki administrators do not normally delete things from a user's sandbox.

4. Use the edit summary: below the edit window is a place to write in a summary - this is a brief description of what you have edited, for example "Corrected spelling", or "added new section on ice cream". This helps other editors know what is happening on the page.

If you look at the you will find that there are reasons why pages get "quickly deleted" (Normal deletion process takes a week). Most of the quick deletions are "complete nonsense pages", "attack pages" (X is gay), pages simply copied and pasted from another wiki or web site, and pages where notability (is the article important enough to be included) is hard to judge.

Other pages that may be helpful:

This Wikipedia needs articles; If they are properly formatted and give interesting (verifiable) information, there is no reason to delete the articles at all.

If you are stuck or if you need some help changing Wikipedia you can ask one of our editors. Below is a list of people who can help you with school projects or help you change Wikipedia. Click on their talk page to ask them a question. 

Please add your name to this list if you are able to help with school projects.

Greetings Simple Wikipedians! I used to have an account but perhaps it's been deactivated due to inactivity. My name is Hunter. I'm teaching a computer course in Chalermkwansatree School in Phitsanulok, Thailand and have given my students an assignment to create content that did not previously exist in Simple English Wikipedia. I have split the class into 15 article-writing groups, 4 English editors and 2 factual content editors. I wanted everybody to have an account like Chalermkwan1, Chalermkwan2, etc., CHSeditor1, etc. We were only allowed to create 6 accounts from the same IP range (we are working from a single computer lab). For this reason, I told any groups that were unable to create an account to just use the Chalermkwan13 account. 

In the meantime, many of the groups have posted their articles and today our editing team was going to begin the proofreading process. I thought it would be most efficient to let them do the editing on wikipedia itself so they can experience first-hand the collaborative working experience. I didn't think any pages would be edited or deleted by moderators in such a short amount of time, so I didn't bother instructing them about what to do if someone deletes their article. Some of them panicked and reversed moderators changes, because they were afraid they would not get points for the assignment. I have instructed my students to refrain from logging in and changing anything until I am able to resolve this issue with the Simple English moderators.

Aem Fatson, I understand your initial suspicions of vandalism and reasons for blocking my students accounts and deleting their articles. But please be patient. We want to enrich Simple English Wikipedia. We have a process in place for correction. If you unblock my students and wait a week or two, I will notify you that our editing teams have finished their work. I am a native speaker and will also play a final supervisory role in the editing process should that be a concern.

FYI, here is a list of the groups and topics that they are working on:

Thanks!

Control engineering

Control engineering is the engineering field that focuses on mathematical modeling of systems of a various nature, analyzing their dynamic behavior, and using control theory to create a controller that will cause the systems to behave in a desired manner. Modern control engineering is closely related to electrical, electronic and computer engineering, as electronic circuits can often be easily explained using control theory techniques. And also it is related to biological unit.Control engineering needs Electrical circuits, antenaa and very small control unit. And as engineering is developing, control engineering is often desired. For example, there are automobile, biologcal engineering, wireless communication, and etc.
In most of the cases, control engineers make use of feedback when designing control systems. For example, in an automobile with sail control the machine's speed is continuously checked and fed back to the system which adjusts the motor's spin power accordingly. Also resently, control system is used in nano technology. And the field of control within chemical engineering is known as process control. For example, we can change chemical process fast and easily. Many developments were invoked by this process control. Like this, Control engineering has a lot if fields that include science, finance management, and even human action. 
So, What is the important thing of control engineering? The answer is feedback. But control engineers may also work on the control of systems without feedback. This is known as open loop control. An open-loop controller, also called a non-feedback controller, is a type of controller which count its input into a system using only the current condition and its model of the system. A classic example of open loop control is a washing machine that works through a scheduled cycle without the use of units.

Set in 80's, While a pollution issue by car's exhaust gas comes to the front, electric vehicle was presented to the solution. 
But lack of Storage battery technology, commercialization has been delayed. 
However, new storage battery technology was proceeded rapidly around the United States while possibility of new technology was created coming to the early 90's. Specially, in case of the United States, in spite of company's strong opposition, California governments legislated the ZEV(Zero Emission Vehicle) regulation that oblige to use EV since 1998. Due to ZEV regulation, development of electric vehicle has been regularized.
There are 2 kinds of electric vehicle in recent. 
The first kind is a vehicle that use fuel cell or solar cell which generate electricity directly from chemical reaction or heat. 
The second kind is a vehicle that drive by storage battery's energy. 
This vehicle use electric motor, so there are no sound, no vibration and no atmospheric contamination by exhaust gases from automobiles. 
However, battery's storage of electricity capability has limit and due to storage battery is so heavy and large, energy efficiency is decreased. Also, It takes much time to recharge battery, and mileage of a vehicle per 1 time recharge is short compared recharging time.

Electronic engineering

Electronic engineering is a discipline that investigates all kinds of situations related to electricity and magnetism. Electronic engineers are concerned with such processes as; the transfer of information using radio waves, the design of electronic circuits, the design of computer systems, and the development of control systems such as aircraft auto-pilots and other embedded systems.
The term electronic engineering started to emerge in the late 1950s. Before the second world war, electronic engineering was commonly known as a 'radio engineering'. At that time, studying radio engineering at a university was part of a physics degree. Later, as consumer devices started to be developed, the field broadened to include modern TV, audio systems, Hi-Fi and later computers and microprocessors. In the mid to late 1950s, the term radio engineering gradually gave way to the name 'electronic engineering', which then became a stand alone university degree subject.
Fundamental studies of the discipline are the sciences of physics and mathematics as these help to get both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of how such systems will work. Today most engineering work involves the use of computers and it is commonplace to use computer-aided design programs when designing electronics (electronic systems).

Irvine, North Ayrshire

Irvine (Gaelic: "Irbhinn") is a coastal new town in North Ayrshire, Scotland. 

Irvine was the site of Scotland's 12th century Military Capital and former headquarters of the Lord High Constable of Scotland, Hugh de Morville. It also served as the Capital of Cunninghame. 

The town was once a haunt of Robert Burns, after whom two streets in the town are named: Burns Street and Burns Crescent. He is known to have worked in a flax mill on the Glasgow Vennell. Despite being classed as a new town, Irvine has had a long history stretching back many centuries and was classed as a Royal Burgh. There are also conflicting rumours that Mary, Queen of Scots, was briefly involved in the town's history. Some say she stayed briefly at Seagate Castle. To this day there is still an annual festival, called Marymass, held in the town. 

Irvine is the birthplace of the present Deputy First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon and the former First Minister of Scotland, Jack McConnell. Its twin town is Saint-Amand-les-Eaux in northern France just outside Lille.

Charles Peter Kennedy MP, PC (born 25 November 1959) is a British politician.

From 9 August 1999 until 7 January 2006, he was the leader of the Liberal Democrats, the third largest political party in the United Kingdom.

In the 1983 General Election he stood for the Ross, Cromarty & Skye constituency, then held by the Conservative MP and Minister, Hamish Gray. In a shock result, Kennedy was elected (for the SDP): at 23, he became the youngest MP in the House of Commons. Ambitious and popular, he quickly emerged as a potential party leader. In 1994, by which time the SDP and the Liberal Party had merged, he became President of the Liberal Democrats - a position he held for four years. In 1999, on the resignation of Paddy Ashdown, Kennedy was elected party leader. 

He took the party through two General Elections. However, he faced criticism for his laid-back leadership style, and there was considerable speculation regarding his alcohol consumption. From December 2005, some within the party were questioning his leadership and calling for a leadership election. On 5 January 2006, Kennedy was informed that ITN would be reporting that he had received treatment for a drinking problem. Kennedy decided to pre-empt the broadcast and admit his drinking problem openly. He called a leadership election at the same time, stating that he intended to stand. The admission of a drinking problem seriously damaged his standing within the parliamentary party. As support for him amongst this key group ebbed away, Kennedy resigned as leader on 7 January, saying that he would not be standing in the leadership election. Deputy leader Sir Menzies Campbell took over as interim leader and was elected as leader on 2 March 2006.

Digital Multimedia Broadcasting

Digital Multimedia Broadcasting or DMB is a technology that allows to send digital signals to mobile devices, such as mobile phones. This makes it possible to listen to radio or watch television on such devices.

This technology was developed to replace earthly analog radio broadcasting. But, the technology can include more data in limited electric waves. It can transmit not only sound data that original object, but also DVD level movie data.

DMB is based on Eureka 147 DAB standard which is the European standard, and similar competing technologies is the mobile TV standard, DVB-H. The earthly DMB is decided to the ETSI standard (TS 102 427 and TS 102 428). Now, Republic of Korea can exercise for source of the DMB technology, the satellite DMB broadcast first began in Japan than in the Republic of Korea. In the March 13, 2004, TU Media playing a leading role in business and satellite DMB insert the world's first satellite for with Japan's partner, MBCo DMB 'hanbyeol'. However, In Republic of Korea, selection process for operators was long and put off service, the MBCo in Japan became first DMB broadcasting country to start the full service all 40 of the channel from 19 October 2004.

Now, the digital multimedia broadcasting is divided by transmitting and receiving method the earthly DMB and satellite DMB, earthly DMB is provided free of charge like current earthly radio broadcasting and the satellite DMB broadcast is provided in the form of the monthly fee. In the Republic of Korea, TU media obtain permission for satellite DMB broadcasting and is broadcasting.

DMB can be received, when attach DMB receiver to the vehicle, or buy mobile phone has the ability to receive DMB, personal portable receiver or receiver which type of output to the monitor when connect personal computer. But there was a problem that the satellite DMB and earthly DMB is not compatible with each other, so user should purchased each terminal separately. However, the Samsung throw open the door to watch satellite DMB and earthly DMB one of the terminals by come out with SPH-B4100. But TU Media side,the satellite DMB service provider rejected the plan, the possibility of the activation of these two-way receiving terminal is currently unclear.

Compareing with terrestrial digital television and digital satellite broadcasting, terrestrial digital television is clear screen even though you are on the high-speed vehicles, but it is limited with range, and lack of channels is disadvantages.

Hurricane Gilbert was a very powerful tropical cyclone which caused much damage to the Caribbean, Mexico and parts of South Texas in the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season. Before Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Hurricane Gilbert was the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic in terms of Barometric pressure. 

This hurricane was similar to Hurricane Beulah and Hurricane Allen, but Hurricane Gilbert was unique in many ways. Gilbert killed 341 people and left $5.5 billion in damage.

In addition to Beulah and Allen, Hurricanes Charlie (1951), Emily during 2005 and Dean in 2007 had tracks similar to Hurricane Gilbert. Emily and Dean were Category 5 hurricanes.

Rhea (bird)

The rheas are flightless birds of the genus "Rhea", native to South America. 

The Greater or American Rhea (also called the 'Nandu') is a large, flightless bird from forests of South America. This ratite is the largest bird in the Americas. It is a fast runner; and when it runs, its neck is almost horizontal to the ground. Rheas congregate in flocks of 20 to 30 birds. The Lesser or Darwin's Rhea, "Rhea pennata", is mostly found in the southern part of South America.

Rheas eat mostly plants, fruits, seeds, and nuts, but also will also eat insects and other small animals (like lizards).

The female rhea lays 12-30 yellow-cream eggs in a clutch. The male digs the nest (a simple scrape in the ground), incubates the eggs (for 6 weeks), and raises the chicks. Rheas are mature at 2 years of age.

It was once thought that ratites were all one monophyletic group, which evolved together in Gondwana in the Upper Cretaceous. Then they evolved in their separate ways as Gondwana split up, and the parts drifted apart. The parts became the modern southern continents, plus Africa and the Indian subcontinent.

However, modern gene analysis conflicts with this. DNA analysis shows that the ratites diverged from one another too recently to share a common Gondwanian ancestor. However, all analyses show that Rheas and the living Australasian/Oceanian ratites "are" monophyletic.

<doc id="144254" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144254" title="Araluen, New South Wales">
Araluen, New South Wales

Araluen () is a small town 27 km south of Braidwood, New South Wales. It is in the Southern Tablelands area of New South Wales, Australia. It is in Palerang Council local government area. It is on the banks of Araluen Creek. The creek joins the Deua River. 

The name 'Araluen' is an Australian Aboriginal word. It is believed to mean 'water lily' or 'place of the water lilies'. When European settlers arrived Araluen was a wide alluvial valley. It had many billabongs covered with water lilies. No billabongs exist in the Araluen valley today. The natural shape and look of Araluen Creek and its valley were completely destroyed by uncontrolled and very destructive gold mining. This took place during the 'gold rush' in the second half of the 1800s.

The first Europeans to explore the area were Kearns, Packer and Marsh in 1822. Andrew Badgery started farming cattle in the area in the 1830s. The first European settler to live at Araluen was Henry Burnell. He was able to buy 1280 acres of land. He started farming sheep and cattle in 1835. With the help of convicts he was able to build a farm house and farm buildings.

Gold was found at Araluen by Alexander Waddell in September 1851. Thousands of people came to Araluen to look for gold during the gold rush. This included many Chinese gold miners. One of these miners was Quong Tart who came to Araluen when he was only 9 years old. He later became a famous business man in Sydney. In the 1860's there were more than 20 hotels in Araluen. The gold was alluvial gold, found in the bottom of the creeks. In some places there was up to 12 metres of dirt and sand on top of the gold. In the 1870's the gold miners used hydraulic sluices (high pressure water hoses) to wash away all the sand and dirt. Big floating dredges (digging machines) were put in the creek. There were 11 there in the 1900's. The last dredge stopped working in 1932.

A flood in the Araluen and Braidwood area killed 24 people on January 1, 1860. The flood destroyed the town. The hotel was the only building left standing in the town. After the gold rush was over most people left the town. The Court House, built about 1861, is now used as a place for tourists to stay.

In May 1865 the bushranger Ben Hall and his gang tried to hold up the Araluen gold coach. The coach carried gold from the Araluen gold fields to Braidwood. This was a very steep road and very hard for a wagon pulled by horses to travel along. Often the only way to goods in and out of the valley was to drag them up or down on sleds. The wagons could not go very fast, so this was a good spot for the bushrangers to rob the coach. The gold coach usually had a policeman with a gun sitting next to the driver. There were 2 more policemen on the back of the carriage. Four more policemen rode on horses in front and behind the coach. The gold was kept in a safe which was bolted to floor of the coach. (The coach has been restored and is on display at the Braidwood Museum)
. The police were able to keep the bushrangers away from the coach, but Constable Kelly was wounded in the shooting.

The Araluen valley is now well known for its fruit farms and orchards. The fruit is sent to Canberra, Sydney and to other countries.

Australian poet, Henry Kendall (1839-1882), wrote a poem called Araluen. This describes the quiet and peaceful mood of the valley. It includes the words ""Araluen -- home of dreams..."". He also called his first daughter Araluen. She was named after the Araluen Creek. She died in 1870 at the age of 13 months.

Araluen is home to author Jackie French.

In November every year, the Braidwood Folk Music club have a weekend of folk music called "Music at the Creek". This is held at the Majors Creek reserve, near the site of the Ben Hall robbery.

The Araluen Zieria (Zieria adenophora), is a small shrub about 50cm tall and 50 cm wide. It is only found in one place, a slope above the Araluen Creek. There are only 56 known plants. It has been listed as Endangered under the Australian government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. It is also listed by the New South Wales Government, Endangered (Schedule 1, Part 1) on the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. There is now a plan to protect the plant. These plans include:

Following on from Creol's point above about the VOA Simple English word book defining "base", our article on base doesn't cover the use as a verb. That was why I thought it might be tricky. If the intention is that it be understood in both forms, should the article be updated? 

The article is currently categorised as a disambiguation page - should it have more cats - that is included in . 

Is a disambiguation page compatible with a page on a BE850 word? Should we have a separate article for disambiguation - ie Base (disambiguation) as well as the article on the word?

Kakapo

The Kakapo ("Strigops habroptilus") is the only parrot which cannot fly. It lives in grassland, scrubland and coastal regions of New Zealand. Kakapo means 'night parrot' in the Maori language.

Kakapos are most active at night (nocturnal), and like to be alone. To keep other kakapos out of their territory, they make a 'skraaarking' sound. The Kakapo can live for about 60 years.

Kakapos are herbivores, or animals who only eat plants. They eat roots, seeds, leaves, buds, small pine cones, fruit, and flowers.

Unlike other parrots, male kakapos gather together to compete with the other males and to call females with a deep booming sound. There are 2 to 3 eggs in each set of eggs laid. The eggs are laid in a hollow part of a tree. The female incubates the eggs for 10 weeks. She only leaves the eggs when she leaves to find food.

Kakapos had no natural enemies on the islands of New Zealand were they live, and lost the ability to fly. At one time there were many kakapos. Now fewer than 100 kakapos still live in New Zealand. It is a critically endangered species. The decrease in the number of kakapos is mostly from predatory animals (for example, cats, dogs, stoats, ferrets,and rats) that settlers brought with them to New Zealand. The kakapo was also eaten by Maori and European settlers. 

At one point, kakapos were almost wiped out. Conservation efforts began in the 1890s, but they were not very successful until the Kakapo Recovery Plan in the 1980s. As of January 2009, surviving Kakapos are kept on two predator-free islands, Codfish (Whenua Hou) and Anchor islands, where they are closely monitored. Two large Fiordland islands, Resolution and Secretary, have been prepared as self-sustaining ecosystems for the Kakapo.

The conservation of the Kakapo has made the species well known. Many books and documentaries detailing the plight of the Kakapo have been produced in recent years, one of the earliest being "Two in the Bush", made by Gerald Durrell for the BBC in 1962. A feature length documentary, won two major awards at the Reel Earth Environmental Film Festival. 

Two of the most significant documentaries, both made by NHNZ, are "Kakapo - Night Parrot" (1982) and "To Save the Kakapo" (1997). The BBC's Natural History Unit also featured the Kakapo, including a sequence with Sir David Attenborough in "The Life of Birds". It was also one of the endangered animals that Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine set out to find for the radio series and book "Last Chance to See". An updated version of the series has been produced for BBC TV, in which Stephen Fry and Carwardine revisit the animals to see how they are getting on almost 20 years later, and in January 2009, they spent time filming the Kakapo on Codfish Island.

Stud poker

Stud poker is a variation of poker where players are typically dealt a total of five or seven cards, with the best five card poker hand winning (in situations where more than one player has the same poker hand, like a flush or straight, the winning hand is determined by whichever players has the highest one).

Stud poker has neither community cards nor blinds. Instead, each player at the table must ante first, and then is dealt two cards face down (hole cards) and one card face up. In typical stud games, the player with the lowest card showing must pay the ‘bring in,’ an amount relative to the limits, which starts off the action.

The bring in is typically a fraction of the limits, (for example, the bring in for a $1/2 stud game may be $.25), with play then continuing clockwise around the table, where players have the choice of folding, calling the bring in, or making the bet ‘complete’ (in our example, completing the bet to $1). Once a bring in has been completed, it can be raised by a subsequent player, doubling the amount to twice the completed bet.

Each player remaining in the hand is then dealt another card face up, with the betting beginning with the player showing the highest two cards and proceeding clockwise around the table. Again, players can fold, call, or raise the bet. In a five card stud game, players are dealt two hole cards facedown, then two cards face up, with the fifth card being dealt facedown. In a seven card stud game, players are dealt two hole cards facedown, then four cards face up, with the seventh card being dealt facedown.

Betting takes place between each dealt card and generally becomes a higher amount after the fourth card dealt. 
Each round of betting is typically referred to by the amount of cards a player has in front of them. After the initial deal, players are considered to be betting on ‘third street’, represented by having three cards in front of them. After the fourth card is dealt, players would then be on ‘fourth street’, and so on. Stud poker is generally played as a limit game.

Parkes, New South Wales

Parkes is a city in New South Wales, Australia. In 2006 there were 9,826 people living in Parkes. It is the centre and main city of the Local Government Area of Parkes Shire. Parkes is on the main Australian transcontinental railway line between Sydney and Perth. The Newell Highway between Victoria and Queensland goes through the city.

Parkes has had an important role in science. it is the home of the Parkes Radio Telescope. As well as local research done at the radio telescope, Parkes scientists have helped NASA. For several missions the telescope was the Southern Hemisphere relay and communications station. The movie "The Dish" was based on the job of the telescope during the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing. 

There are many different kinds of farms around Parkes. Most farms are growing wheat and sheep.

Parkes is has a gold and copper mine, Northparkes, north of the town.

Parkes was an important transport centre after the railway was built in 1893. Many passenger and freight trains stopped at Parkes up until the 1980s. Governments began cutting back the NSW country rail systems and the trains are no longer an important part of Parkes. One company, FCL has a big train and truck transport centre at Gooobang Junction on Parkes' western edge. It was opened on 20 October 2006 by NSW Premier Morris Iemma. Specialised Container Transport's transport terminal is built on a 296 hectare site. It has 5 km of railway sidings, a 7,400 square metre warehouse and about 40 people work there. An even larger terminal to be built nearby is also being planned.

Over the years governments and businesses have talked about making Parkes an "inland port". Parkes Regional Airport would be made much bigger. This would become a starting point for goods coming from Australia and other countries that were to be sent to places in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. All the studies have been done, agreements to start building have been made, some land has been bought.

The Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW has the Western Regional Office built in Parkes. Country Energy which supplies electricity and gas has a training and maintenance (repair) centre. 

Many people come to Parkes to see the CSIRO radio telescope which is 20km north of town on the Newell Highway. other things to see are Bushmans Hill, and the War Memorial Lookout. Nearby there is the Goobang National Park, and Peak Hill. peak Hill has an open cut mine (a big hole in the ground) that can be visited during holidays. There are also many great parks.

Parkes was started as a settlement in 1853. It was first called "Currajong" after the many kurrajong trees in the local area. After a while it was called "Bushman's" after the local gold mine named Bushman's Lead. 

In 1873 the town was renamed to Parkes in honour of Sir Henry Parkes. He is called the "Father of the Federation". Sir Henry Parkes is famous in Australia for getting Australia to become one country in 1901. Before this Australia was made up of separate British colonies.

A lot of people came to Parkes in the gold rush of the 1870s. There are still mining companies with sites in the local area.

Parkes has a dry climate. The winter temperatures are rarely lower than 0 degrees Celsius during the night. In summer daytime temperatures can be as high as 40 to 45 degrees Celsius. Temperatures in the low to mid-30s are most common.

Parkes has a local bus service run by Western Road Liners. It took over from Harris Bus Lines in March 2006. The Indian Pacific train also stops twice a week. The Broken Hill Outback Xplorer service, run by CountryLink, goes to Broken Hill on Mondays and to Sydney on Tuesdays. Parkes railway station is situated on the Broken Hill railway line. It was opened in 1893. There was also a small station at Parkes Racecourse from 1923 to 1937.


Parkes hosts a yearly Elvis Presley Festival in early January to celebrate Elvis Presley's birthday. The first festival, held in 1993, was a one night show with 200 people coming along. Over the next few years more events were added and the festival was extended to two days. By January 2005 the 3,500 people came to the festival. In January 2006 there were 5,000 going to the festival. It brought about $8 million into Parkes. 

The 2007 festival had over 60 events and was held over 5 days. More than 6,000 visitors attended. A new world record was set for the most Elvis impersonators (people trying to look like Elvis) in one place. SBS TV made a half-hour film about the festival. It was called "Elvis Lives in Parkes". It was shown on Australian TV on 10 January 2007.. The festival is still getting bigger with more than 8,000 visitors in 2008.

Mink

Minks are small, short-legged members of the Mustelid family. The mink is an aggressive mammal that is adapted to a semi-aquatic life. Mink live in swamps, rivers, marshes, lakes and streams in North America, Europe, and the far west of Asia. Mink have a life span of about 8 to 10 years in captivity. 

Minks are carnivores (meat-eaters). They eat small mammals (like mice, rats and muskrats), frogs, crayfish, fish, insects, eggs, and ducks. 

Owls, wolves, coyotes, and bobcats prey on the mink.

The breeding season is April to May. It takes 45 to 52 days after mating for birth to take place. A mink litter normally has 6 to 10 cubs (kittens).

<doc id="144387" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144387" title="Id, ego, and super-ego">
Id, ego, and super-ego

The Id, ego, and super-ego are ideas created by Sigmund Freud. They are three concepts to explain the way the human mind works.

Freud describes the human mind as interaction of id, ego, super-ego. The ego, and to some extent the super-ego, is conscious or on the surface. The id remains unconscious or sub-conscious. Together they make up the personality. 

According to this model of the psyche, the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends; the ego is the organised, realistic part; and the super-ego plays the critical and moralising role.

The id, ego and super-ego are functions of the mind, "not" parts of the brain. They do not correspond one-to-one with actual structures of the kind dealt with by neuroscience.

The id represents a constant in the personality as it is always present. The id is governed by the 'pleasure principle'. 

Early in the development of his theory Freud saw sexual energy as the only source of energy for the id. After the tragedy of World War I, however, Freud felt it necessary to add another instinct to the id. So, he proposed thanatos, the death instinct. Thanatos accounts for the instinctual violent urges of humankind. Obviously, the rest of the personality would have somehow to deal with these two instincts. By adding thanatos, he could describe more mental phenomena. His idea of id affected a variety of fields.

The id is unconscious by definition: 

The ego is the surface of the personality, the part you usually show the world. The ego is governed by the 'reality principle', or a practical approach to the world. It seeks to turn the id’s drive to behaviour which benefits in the long term rather than brings grief. 

Conscious awareness resides in the ego, although not all of the operations of the ego are conscious.

The ego separates out what is real. It helps us to organise our thoughts and make sense of them and the world around us. 

But the ego "serves three severe masters...the external world, the super-ego and the id". Its task is to find a balance between primitive drives and reality while satisfying the id and super-ego. "Thus the ego, driven by the id, confined by the super-ego, repulsed by reality, struggles...[in] bringing about harmony among the forces and influences working in and upon it, and readily 'breaks out in anxiety".

The Super-ego aims for perfection. It comprises that part of the personality, mainly unconscious, which includes the individual's ego ideals, spiritual goals, and the psychic agency (commonly called "conscience") that criticises and prohibits his or her drives, fantasies, feelings, and actions. 

The superego consists of two parts, the conscience and the ego-ideal. The conscience is the familiar metaphor of angel and devil on each shoulder. The conscience decides what course of action one should take. The ego-ideal is an idealized view of one's self. Comparisons are made between the ego-ideal and one's actual behavior. Both parts of the super-ego develop through experience with others or via social interactions. According to Freud, a strong super-ego serves to inhibit the biological instincts of the id, while a weak super-ego gives in to the id's urgings. Further, the levels of guilt in the two cases above will be high and low, respectively.

MTV Unplugged in New York

MTV Unplugged in New York was the first out of two live albums by the American grunge band Nirvana. (The second one was "From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah".) It was recorded on November 18, 1993 as a part of the "MTV Unplugged" television series, which many artists and bands perform on. It was released on November 1, 1994, six months after the band had broken up because of the death of Kurt Cobain, who was the lead singer and guitarist.

It was unusual compared to other artists on the "MTV Unplugged" series, because Nirvana played mostly their less-famous songs and cover versions of other artists' songs. Most artists on the program played mainly their hits.

Four singles were released from the album. This was unusual because it was a live album. The singles were "About a Girl", "The Man Who Sold the World", "Where Did You Sleep Last Night", and "Lake of Fire". All of these except for "About a Girl" were covers.

Doenjang

Doenjang is a Korean soybean paste. It is salty and savory, and is used to season many kinds of Korean food. It is similar to Miso, Japanese soybean paste.

The history of Doenjang begins before the period of three kingdoms. Books from the Chosun dynasty explain the way to make good Doenjang, saying that if doenjang in a house tastes bad, food in the house tastes bad. This means doenjang has been an important food in Korea for a long time.

The main ingredients of Doenjang are sea water and "Meju". The basic way to make Doenjang is to take Mejus and put them into big jars with sea water. Bad bacteria and odor are removed by adding charcoal and sun-dried chili peppers. Liquid is then taken out to make Korean soy sauce. This sauce takes about 20 to 30 days to make. The Mejus are taken out from the jar and tempered. Salt and soy sauce is added on this paste and the paste is put in jars again. After sun-drying for several days, it becomes Doenjang.

There are several kinds of Doenjang; Chungukjang, Makjang, Dambukjang, BbamjangBbagaejang, Patjang, Jipjang, Garoojang, and Borijang. Each is made in different ways using different ingredients or at different times of the year. For example, Chungukjang is made within two to three days, whereas the other take longer time to make. Patjang uses red bean. Makjang is made in Spring.
Moreover there are several attempts to improve doenjang using additional ngredients, such as green tea.

Many traditional Korean foods, which are well-known as healthy food, uses Doenjang as their ingredients. Doenjang Jjigae and Chungukjang JJigae are examples of this.
Also, Korean have doenjang when they eat Ssambop, Samgyupsal, etc.

According to recent research, Doenjang has several materials that prevent cancer. Doenjang is very nutritious. Since Doenjang is a fermented food like yogurt and cheese, it is said that the older it is, the better it is.

West Punjab

West Punjab was a former province of Pakistan which existed from 1947 to 1955. The province covered an area of ,including much of the current Punjab province and the Islamabad Capital Territory, but excluding the former princely state of Bahawalpur. The capital was the city of Lahore and the province was mad up of four divisions (Lahore, Sargodha, Multan and Rawalpindi). The province was bordered by the Indian states of East Punjab to the east, the princely state of Bahawalpur to the south, the provinces of Balochistan and Sindh to the southwest, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the northwest, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Occupied Kashmir to the northeast.

The independence of Pakistan in 1947 led to the divisions of the Punjab province into two new provinces. The East Punjab where most people were Sikh and Hindu became part of the new nation of India while the mainly Muslim West Punjab became part of the new nation of Pakistan. The name of the province was shortened to Punjab in 1950. West Punjab was merged into the province of West Pakistan in 1955 under the One Unit policy announced by Prime Minister Chaudhry Mohammad Ali. When that province was dissolved, the area of the former province of West Punjab was combined with the former state of Bahawalpur to form a new Punjab Province.

At independence there was a Muslim majority in West Punjab with significant minorities of Hindus and Sikhs. Nearly all of these minorities left West Punjab for India, to be replaced by large numbers of Muslims fleeing in the opposite direction. The official language of West Punjab was Urdu but most of the population spoke Punjabi using the Shahmukhi script.

The offices of "Governor" of West Punjab and "Chief Minister" of West Punjab lasted from August 15 1947, until 14th October 1955. The first Governor was Sir Francis Mudie with Iftikhar Hussain Khan as the first Chief Minister. Both offices were abolished in 1955, when the province of West Pakistan was created. The last Governor of West Punjab, Mushtaq Ahmad Gurmani, became the first Governor of West Pakistan.

Hurricane Andrew

Although the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season was below average, Hurricane Andrew was the exception to that. This hurricane blasted the Bahamas, southeast Florida and south central Louisiana, taking a path extremely similar to Hurricane Betsy, which also struck southern Florida and Louisiana. However, unlike Betsy, Andrew did not make flooding in New Orleans. Contrary to typical, damage from Hurricane Andrew was caused almost entirely by high winds rather than storm surge in Florida and Louisiana. This storm caused between $23-30 billion in damage (1992 USD) and between 56 and 68 fatalities, making Andrew the costliest Atlantic hurricane to hit the United States. However, Hurricane Katrina would later surpass Andrew in official damage amounts.

Andrew's devastating damage spawned many rumors, including claims that hundreds or even thousands of migrant farm workers in south Dade County (now Miami-Dade County) were killed and their deaths were not reported in official accounts. An investigation by the "Miami Herald" found no basis for such rumors. These rumors were probably based on the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane, when the deaths of migrant workers initially went uncounted, and were still debated at the time of Andrew.

The slow response of federal aid to storm victims in southern Florida led Dade County emergency management director Kate Hale to famously exclaim at a nationally televised news conference, "Where in the hell is the cavalry on this one? They keep saying we're going to get supplies. For God's sake, where are they?" Almost immediately, President George H. W. Bush promised, "Help is on the way," and mobile kitchens and tents, along with units from the 82nd Airborne Division, began pouring in.

Insurance claims in the wake of the extreme damage caused by Andrew led to the bankruptcy and closure of 11 insurance agencies and drained an excessive amount of equity from 30 more. Nearly one million residences were no longer eligible for coverage by any insurance agency. This led the Florida Legislature to create new agencies (the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund) to restore important insurance coverage.

Homeowners and officials criticized developers and contractors for poor building practices and poor building codes. An inquiry after the storm concluded that there were probably construction flaws in some buildings, and that the state of Florida did enforce some strict building codes since 1986, but they were either overlooked or ignored. However, the evidence was not sufficient enough to issue criminal charges for neglect.

The effects of Hurricane Andrew on Florida wetlands were considerable. In the Florida Everglades, 25%, 70,000 acres (280 km²) of trees were knocked down by the storm. It took 20 days for new trees and vegetation to grow following the storms passing. Damage to marine life was moderate as the storm lowered the oxygen level in the water, threatening many fish and other marine wildlife. In addition, the storm killed 182 million fish in the basin, causing $160 million (1992 USD) in lost value. 
In the decade after the storm, Hurricane Andrew may have contributed to the massive and sudden housing boom in Broward County, Florida. Located just north of Miami-Dade County, residents who had lost their homes moved to western sections of the county that were just starting to be developed. The result was record growth in places like Miramar, Pembroke Pines and Weston.

In Louisiana, the hurricane knocked down 80% of the trees in part of the Atchafalaya River Basin near the coast. Offshore, the storm killed 9.4 million fish, causing $7.8 million (1992 USD) in lost value, and damaged large areas of marshland along the Louisiana coast.

About 6,200 people had to be housed in 36 shelters, according to the American Red Cross. The Salvation Army sent in 37 mobile food storages, that served 40,000 meals, to help those who could get little or no food.

Federal aid, from the Pentagon, sent in four 750 kilowatt generators, 2,500 cots, and 30,000 MRE's, or prepackaged meals, to Louisiana. About 1,279 National Guard were deployed to Louisiana, to do various duties, from cooking to patrolling.

Sheriffs along the coast of Louisiana proposed a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. local time. Alcohol sales were also stopped immediately after the storm.

Because of exceptional and widespread damage in Florida and Louisiana, the name "Andrew" was retired in the Spring of 1993, and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. The name was replaced by Alex for the 1998 season.

<doc id="144594" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144594" title="Hurricane Gordon (1994)">
Hurricane Gordon (1994)

Hurricane Gordon was a very damaging tropical storm for the Caribbean, Florida and parts of North Carolina. The storm was very slow moving on its path over the Caribbean. This storm killed over 1100 people (estimates are between 500-2300 people dead through Haiti and the central Caribbean islands, including Jamaica and Cuba). The storm's strange motion was making Hurricane Gordon hard to forecast where it would actually go and where it would reach land. Hurricane Gordon was the last storm of the inactive 1994 Season and the second most costly of the 1994 season, even though the storm was a hurricane for only a few hours.

On November 8 a tropical wave near Costa Rica became Tropical Depression Twelve. On November 10th in made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. The same day it became Tropical Storm Gordon after moving back into the Caribbean. It made its first landfall near Kingston, Jamaica on November 13 it soon made its second landfall in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on the same day. The storm brushed the northern coast of Cuba and the southern islands of the Bahamas. It made its third landfall in Key West, Florida on November 15. Gordon turned northeast and made it fourth landfall in Fort Myers, Florida the next day. When Gordon crossed Florida it took about nine hours and it went into the Atlantic Ocean on a northeastward track. Gordon stayed on that track until November 17, when it became Hurricane Gordon while it was about 245 miles southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina. Shortly after becoming a hurricane it reached top winds of 85 mph and then brushed the coast of North Carolina. Gordon weakened back to a tropical storm and started on a U-shaped track. Gordon weakened further into a tropical depression and on November 19 it made its fifth and last landfall near Vero Beach, Florida and on November 21 Gordon died out while over South Carolina. 

The damage in Haiti is unknown. But in Haiti, Hurricane Gordon killed about 1,122 people. The number is high likely because of mudslides and because of the deforestation (removing trees) of the forests in Haiti.
Florida was where most of the damage was. Damage in Florida was at about $400 million. Gordon also crossed the state three times, which is likely why the damage is that high. 
In the spring of 1995 Gordon was not retired even though it caused lots of deaths in Haiti. Since Gordon was not retired in 1994, the name Gordon was used again in 2000 and 2006 and will be again used in the 2012 hurricane season.

Hurricane Diana (1984)

Hurricane Diana was really unusual and had forecasters guessing when or where it would strike. In September of the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season, Diana became an intense tropical cyclone, bringing maximum sustained winds of 136 mph during its peak. The storm eventually made landfall in southeast North Carolina with winds around 88 to 100 mph. No direct fatalities were reported, though three indirect deaths did happen because of Hurricane Diana in September 1984. Hurricane Diana was the first major hurricane in eastern North Carolina in almost three decades. Although it was a category 4 hurricane it caused only $65 million in damage.

Bull shark

The bull shark ("Carcharhinus leucas") has a short snout that is wider than it is long (hence its name). Its belly is off-white, its top surface is gray, and the eyes are small. The first dorsal fin is much longer and more pointed than the second dorsal fin. A pup's fins have black tips, but these marking fade in the adults. The females are larger than the males. 

The bull shark is found close to shore and can live for a while in fresh water, frequenting estuaries, rivers and lakes. It has been found up to 1,750 miles (2800 km) up the Mississippi River in the USA and 2,500 miles (4000 km) up the Amazon River in Peru. It has been found in Lake Nicaragua (Central America) and the Zambezi River (Africa). Many people believe this is most dangerous shark in the world. Sharks are being found in Lake Miniatare in the state of Nebraska.

The bull shark eats fish (including other sharks and rays), turtles, birds, mollusks, crustaceans, and dolphins. It will eat almost anything. 

Bull sharks are viviparous (like mammals, giving birth to live animals that were nourished by through a placenta). Litters of 1 to 13 pups are common after a gestation period of about one year. Pups are about 28 inches (70 cm) long at birth. Very young bull sharks are frequently found in protected bays near the mouths of rivers, in briny water.

White émigré

White émigré (Белоэмигрант) is a political term used to describe Russian people who left Russia because of the Russian Revolution or Civil War. The term is used in France, the United States and the United Kingdom. Sometimes the term is used to describe everyone who left the country because of changes in the government.

The words "White émigré" had a very negative meaning in the Soviet Union between 1920 and 1980. After 1980, those people who left during that time are called first wave émigrés.

Many White émigrés thought the White movement was something good. Some of them, the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, did not like the Bolsheviks but did not like the White movement either. Others were just not interested in politics. Many of those who left are still part of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

Most White émigrés left Russia between 1917 and 1920. Between 900,000 and two million people left. Many different classes of people left. These classes included military soldiers and officers, Cossacks, intellectuals, businessmen and landowners. Officials of the Russian Imperial Government and anti-Bolshevik governments of the Russian Civil War also left.

Most émigrés left Southern Russia and Ukraine and went to Turkey. They then moved to eastern European Slavic countries, for example the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. A large number also went to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Germany and France. Berlin and Paris had large émigré communities. 

Many civilians and military officers in Siberia and the Far East moved to Shanghai and other surrounding areas of China, Central Asia, and Eastern Turkestan. Some moved to Japan. 

During and after World War II, many Russian émigrés moved to the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, and Australia.

White émigrés often did not like Communism. They did not believe the Soviet Union was properly Russian. They believed the period of time from 1917 until 1991 was a time of occupation by the Soviet government which was internationalist and anti-Christian.

Many White émigrés believed that Russia should be governed by a monarch. Others thought that the government should be chosen by popular plebiscite.

Many White émigrés believed that their mission was to keep the culture and way of life from the time before the revolution while living in other countries. They believe that by doing this, they could return Russia to this culture when the Soviet Union was no longer in control of the country.

A religious mission to the outside world was another idea used by the émigrés. Bishop John of Shanghai and San Francisco (canonized as a saint of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad) said at the 1938 All-Diaspora Council:

Many White émigrés also believed that they should still fight against the Soviet dictatorship. They hoped this would help free Russia. This idea was largely inspired by General Pyotr Wrangel. When the White army was defeated, he said, "The battle for Russia has not ceased, it has merely taken on new forms". ("We are not done trying to free Russia. We just have to use different ways to do so.")

White army veteran Captain Vasili Orekhov, publisher of the "Sentry" journal, wrote about this idea of responsibility with the following words:

The émigrés formed different organisations which had the purpose of fighting against the Soviet regime. Examples of such organisations are the Russian All-Military Union, the Brotherhood of Russian Truth, and the NTS. This made the White émigrés a target for infiltration by the Soviet secret police (i.e. operation TREST and the Inner Line). Seventy-five White army veterans served as volunteers supporting Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War.

Some White émigrés adopted pro-Soviet sympathies, for which they were labelled "Soviet patriots". These people formed organizations such as the Mladorossi, the Evraziitsi, and the Smenovekhovtsi.

During World War II, many White émigrés took part in the Russian Liberation Movement. On the other hand, a significant number participated in anti-Nazi movements such as the French Resistance. During the war, the White émigrés came into contact with former Soviet citizens from German-occupied territories who used the German retreat as an opportunity to flee from the Soviet Union or were in Germany and Austria as POWs and forced labourers and preferred to stay in the West, often referred to as the "second wave" of émigrés (often also called DPs – displaced persons, see Displaced persons camp). This smaller second wave fairly quickly began to assimilate into the White émigré community.

After the war, active anti-Soviet combat was almost exclusively continued by NTS: other organizations either dissolved, or began concentrating exclusively on self-preservation and/or educating the youth. Various youth organizations, such as the Russian scouts in exile became functional in raising children with a background in pre-Soviet Russian culture and heritage.

The White émigrés, acting to preserve their church from Soviet influence, formed the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad in 1924. The church continues its existence to this day, acting as both the spiritual and cultural center of the Russian Orthodox community abroad. On May 17, 2007, the Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate reestablished canonical ties between the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad and the Russian Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, after more than eighty years of separation.

Instrumentation includes finding the most appropriate measurement method, designing and producing of the machine, getting the required information and result of what has been measured by the calculation and take appropriate measures for that result.
Instrumentation means a lot more than measurement. For example, setting up the sulphur dioxide(SO) density measuring machine and getting the reading is measurement. But, how to use this machine, which machine is to set up, how many places to set up, what to calculate with the reading, in what situation it should sent the sign for alarm are problems handled by the instrumentation.

An instrument is a tool used to measure and manage the variables in a process.
Instrumentation can be used to measure various variables(physical values) like :

Examples of instruments are valves, transmitters, flame detectors and analyzers. Valve is a device that helps with the flow of materials (like gases, fluidized solids, slurries, or liquids). Transmitter is a electronic device or tool which sends or receives a signal through electromagnetic radiation. Flame detector is a device which detects the flame by analyzing the color.

Instrumentation is also studying about the control. Control is like how valve is managing the amount of contents flowing through it and break controlling over the speed. Control can change the parameter of the field or the variable.
